I *may* have been served a gag order or am otherwise required by
law not to disclose something if *any* of the following is true:
* the signature on this file is invalid or missing
* this file is missing or inaccessible
* this file has not been updated in over a month

Keep in mind that there could be other reasons for this canary
to not be updated. For example, technical difficulties may
prevent me from updating this website. If the canary is missing
or is older than the most recent weblog entry, it's a pretty
good sign that I am in distress and need help, but if the site
is down or has not been updated, there is a chance that I am
just fine.

My PGP key ID is 0xE7464A03 and my PGP fingerprint is
D135 B061 DBED 690B 479F E2E3 7D83 E1E5 E746 4A03.

As of today, Thursday, 2018 January 11,
I have not been legally required to withhold information.
University of the People has issued me a take-down request for
some pages on this website, but I have not been asked to keep
quiet about it.

This file is what is known as a warrant canary. The USA PATRIOT
Act allows the government to *defile the rights granted to us in
the constitution* in certain ways, such as prohibiting the
disclosure of the existence certain warrants and subpoenas. It
is, however, legal to disclose whenever these things *have not*
been served. As long as this file is up-to-date, it means that I
am still legally allowed to speak freely. If this file has gone
stale, it means that I am not able to disclose something that I
really should be able to.

For more information on warrant canaries, please see:
 * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary>
 * <https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/warrant-canary-faq>

This canary has gone down in the past due to technical issues:
 * 2015-05-11 through 2015-05-29
  '- My laptop died on me. I had no way to update the website.
 * 2016-02-01 through 2016-10-09
  '- Various life circumstances made website updates difficult.
