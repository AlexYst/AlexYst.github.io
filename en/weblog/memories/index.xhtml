<p>
	This page is a mess.
	I&apos;m in the middle of construction, so there&apos;s much debris.
	Please ignore this page for now.
</p>
<p>
	the spirit of adventure
	ran away - should have stayed gone, in retrospect
	suicide attempts
	tan phase
	getting started with html
	glass shop
	wood shop
	drama class
	lunches alone
	no real friends - couldn&apos;t have anyone over because the house was always a big mess
	we were told we could have people over if we cleaned it, but it was all my mother&apos;s stuff and she&apos;d tell us to leave it where it was if we asked where it belonged
	&quot;you don&apos;t really feel that way&quot; - father&apos;s betrayal
	wanted a vagina
	learned about sex and decided never to have children
	boxers made in home economics
	learned to cross stitch
	card games at school (in the halls and in maths class)
	&quot;impossible&quot; subtraction problems
	&quot;is it a circle or a square?&quot;
	denied for a credit card due to having insufficient credit history
	mother threatening sister to not be vegetarian, but mad when she went veg afterwards - thought she&apos;d &quot;solved&quot; the problem
	wouldn&apos;t call me by my middle name, then did
	foreign exchange student - mother upset because they didn&apos;t want to stay at home, and instead wanted to get out with freinds and experience the city
	portable games in bathroom - she thought I was masturbating, even thought I was masturbating while in bath
	mother made me fail out of old school
	girl had a crush on me
	mother thought I had crush on other girl for years
	I found third girl attractive, but had decided to avoid girls
	bashoozled - confused
	pedestrated - walked
	forced into drama and music class - bad at both
	not ready for drama class due to depression and repression - would probably enjoy it these days
	other students ruined my play
	football game - I preferred to be the goalie so I wouldn&apos;t have to chase the ball
	after one game, I splashed puddle water on my face to make my parents think I worked hard and was sweaty
	I never liked football
	I don&apos;t recall it, but my mother said I used to try to pick flowers instead of playing the game
	I sucked at throwing and catching, but I always loved dodge ball
	vivian and I used to pretend to go on ghost hunts
	mother claimed I wasn&apos;t playing nicely because I actually strategized in card game
	waited for santa, don&apos;t remember falling asleep, but found gifts suddenly set - mother reported I&apos;d been asleep when she came out, starting my suspicions of santa
	had she not said that, I would have thought santa magically laid out the gifts in an instant, but also, why would she even come out there?
	won a stuffed rabbit in an egg hunt - loved that thing
	parents took toy &quot;temporarily&quot;, but put it outside to mould
	gay &quot;friend&quot; stole my large ball bearing, claiming to have used it as ammunition and gotten it lodged in his house
	gay &quot;friend&quot; used to talk for hours on the telephone, boring me immensely
	I didn&apos;t know how to tell him to stop, but mother always got annoyed that we were tying up the line and made us stop eventually
	mother and father always argued loudly
	mother mad I wouldn&apos;t install her special app to my device, claiming I was missing out on fun because of ethics - I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve had fun though if I&apos;d installed it, due to actually caring about ethics
	set up tracker for mother - mother broke it, then hard drive died
	original machine learning MOOC - mother not happy I needed time with computer
	job was too hot, I avoided break not knowing the rules, then the boss asked me if I was done with the break I never wanted
	assistant manager thought I was repressed - I guess they were right
	spilled two whole buckets of sauce - boss said it was coming out of my pay chequw - never learned whether they were serious or not
	mother upset when she learned I was a flexitarian (I&apos;m vegan now, but it was way too hard to be vegan with her in the house threatening)
	ate too much candy, so mother put me on a candy diet
	mother had my testosterone levels checked - low, but nothing was ever done about that
	iritis
	croup
	knocked myself out at girl scout camp - my code name was ground beetle, related to vivian&apos;s code name of ladybug
	I really enjoyed earth science
	teacher thought nature was a sign of Yahweh &quot;elmer&quot; paper
	never did learn to write cursive in school - thought it was stupid - might learn cursive in the near future though
	spent nights playing video games when mother went off on long trip - maybe it was her trip to texas (we&apos;re in oregon)
	fast food bakes potatoes frequently - must have been expensive
	father lived in studio apartment
	mother and us moved in with her mother
	never had a problem with gays - I figured butt sex was no worse than vaginal sex - both were gross
	I guess I didn&apos;t think about lesbians - they had nothing to do with me because I had a penis
	original website - trying to get that set up to be reachable from the outside world
	figuring out how to compile Apache and PHP because the PHP attached to my OS was too old and new PHP didn&apos;t work with old Apache
	laptop with bad hinge - later learned this was a common Apple problem
	old Apple computer OS X 10.4.11
	used laptop from pibling - ran windows, not going to work
	researched how to install OS X - turned out to be illegal
	Ubuntu 12.04 for a week - then realised I didn&apos;t have to commit
	Debian 6
	Mint 13?
	Xubuntu ... not sure what version by then
	Trisquel due to FSF endorsement, then abandoned it due to learning the FSF was full of crap
	my mother was always against Apple, but then she got an iPhone as her first smartphone, and now refuses to try anything else
	I understand avoiding a particular product because you&apos;ve learned it doesn&apos;t work, but I don&apos;t understand gripping a product so hard you won&apos;t try anything else and learn whether it&apos;s better
	axe handle hidden in tree
	mother wouldn&apos;t leave my face alone
	I never went to any school dances
	bipolar mother always made me feel inadequate
	felt like I was a mistake of nature
	typing game in school
	always hated birth given name - hated birth middle name more
	used to think girls should stop dressing in girl clothes because it was socially acceptable for them to wear boy clothes and the separate clothing style was ridiculous - I now understand though that it&apos;s the boys that need to let go of the nonsense and dress however they like
	what I learned confused me and made me think I wasn&apos;t a girl
	my male drama teacher looked quite nice in a dress
	Cornell notes
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;m a computer.
	You can see that.
	I am so hungry.
	I haven&apos;t eaten in weeks.
	Get in my disk drive,
	and I&apos;ll swallow.
	...
	can&apos;t remember the rest
	old logo - can&apos;t remember it well enough to replicate it
