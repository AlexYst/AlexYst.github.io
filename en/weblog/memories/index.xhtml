	This page is a mess.
	I&apos;m in the middle of construction, so there&apos;s much debris.
	Please ignore this page for now.
</p>
<p>
SCHOOL:
	glass shop
	wood shop
	drama class
	lunches alone
	no real friends - couldn&apos;t have anyone over because the house was always a big mess
	we were told we could have people over if we cleaned it, but it was all my mother&apos;s stuff and she&apos;d tell us to leave it where it was if we asked where it belonged
	&quot;you don&apos;t really feel that way&quot; - father&apos;s betrayal
	boxers made in home economics
	learned to cross stitch
	card games at school (in the halls and in maths class)
	&quot;impossible&quot; subtraction problems
	&quot;is it a circle or a square?&quot;
	bashoozled - confused
	pedestrated - walked
	forced into drama and music class - bad at both
	not ready for drama class due to depression and repression - would probably enjoy it these days
	other students ruined my play
	I sucked at throwing and catching, but I always loved dodge ball
	gay &quot;friend&quot; stole my large ball bearing, claiming to have used it as ammunition and gotten it lodged in his house
	I really enjoyed earth science
	teacher thought nature was a sign of Yahweh - &quot;elmer&quot; paper
	never did learn to write cursive in school - thought it was stupid - might learn cursive in the near future though
	my male drama teacher looked quite nice in an emerald dress - thought men in dresses was funny - British humour, they said, if I recall
	typing game in school
	Cornell notes
	Summer pissed off I skipped my graduation ceremony
	mother made me fail out of old school
	Web-based game

WEB:
	getting started with html
	set up tracker for mother - mother broke it, then hard drive died
	Summer insisted that www was a part of my address because she didn&apos;t notice the redirect - from then on, never redirected, but instead, put up separate website telling visitors to remove the www
	figuring out how to compile Apache and PHP because the PHP attached to my OS was too old and new PHP didn&apos;t work with old Apache

MOOCS:
	original machine learning MOOC - mother not happy I needed time with computer
	one of the first online courses, on AI
	original website - trying to get that set up to be reachable from the outside world

FOOTBALL:
	football game - I preferred to be the goalie so I wouldn&apos;t have to chase the ball
	after one game, I splashed puddle water on my face to make my parents think I worked hard and was sweaty
	I never liked football
	I don&apos;t recall it, but my mother said I used to try to pick flowers instead of playing the game

TOXICITY:
	mother threatening sister to not be vegetarian, but mad when she went veg afterwards - thought she&apos;d &quot;solved&quot; the problem
	wouldn&apos;t call me by my middle name, then did
	foreign exchange student - mother upset because they didn&apos;t want to stay at home, and instead wanted to get out with friends and experience the city
	mother claimed I wasn&apos;t playing nicely because I actually strategized in card game
	mother mad I wouldn&apos;t install her special app to my device, claiming I was missing out on fun because of ethics - I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve had fun though if I&apos;d installed it, due to actually caring about ethics
	mother upset when she learned I was a flexitarian (I&apos;m vegan now, but it was way too hard to be vegan with her in the house threatening)
	mother wouldn&apos;t leave my face alone until I put on an annoyed face every time she touched it
	bipolar mother always made me feel inadequate
	mother took very nice bag from me, replaced it with a trashy bag in exchange
	Summer insisted I get a bunk bed, so I slept on the floor
	mother and father always argued loudly

SANTA:
	waited for santa, don&apos;t remember falling asleep, but found gifts suddenly set - mother reported I&apos;d been asleep when she came out, starting my suspicions of santa
	had she not said that, I would have thought santa magically laid out the gifts in an instant, but also, why would she even come out there?

SEPARATION:
	father lived in truck, then studio apartment
	mother and us moved in with her mother

SUICIDE:
	felt like I was a mistake of nature
	ran away - should have stayed gone, in retrospect
	suicide attempts

HEALTH:
	iritis
	croup
	knocked myself out at girl scout camp - my code name was ground beetle, related to Vivian&apos;s code name of ladybug

WORK:
	job was too hot, I avoided break not knowing the rules, then the boss asked me if I was done with the break I never wanted
	didn&apos;t know to look for schedule and asked boss each day when to come in next
	forgot to come in after five days of work, hoped not to be in trouble
	guess I didn&apos;t have shift, as I wasn&apos;t
	Summer told me to get schedule, and eventually had me send it to her each week via <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> - used <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> gateways
	gave Summer all my pay cheques, but she wouldn&apos;t deposit them
	finally set up bank account out of fear they&apos;d expire, and fearfully told Summer about it
	she didn&apos;t actually care, and gave me back what cheques she knew where were
	later &quot;borrowed&quot; thousands of dollars from me though, never to return them, so she might as well have taken the cheques and deposited them as I&apos;d asked her to
	spilled two whole buckets of sauce - boss said it was coming out of my pay cheque - never learned whether they were serious or not

CLOVERS:
	many four-leafers
	one or two five-leafers
	a six-, seven-, and nine-leafer
	many clovers found in the schoolyard, and these oddballs were no different
	lost these, Summer never seemed to believe me that I found them to begin with
	the nine-leafer looked incredibly unhealthy
	it was plenty green and vibrant, but it had leaves growing out of leaves and leaves partly fused with leaves
	I always thought having more than three leaves was a mutation, but this mutant made its mutant status patently obvious
	If I recall, Summer claimed never to have found so many as we - Summer included - found at the school
	with them seemingly common there and my thinking they were mutants, it made me wonder about the health of the area - was all the car exhaust harming the clovers?
	it was a busy street and a large parking lot
	(by the way, research on the Web confirms that yes, having more than three leaves (or actually, leaflets) is a mutation in clovers)
	Summer had a clover-looking plant in the flowerbed, but all the stems had four leaves, larger than clover leaves by far - I don&apos;t know what it was, but I doubt it was an actual clover plant - very likely related to clovers though
	I think I recall the leaves either being red or having red on them, but I don&apos;t rightly recall
	might have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalis_tetraphylla">Oxalis tetraphylla</a>, a plant known to resemble clover and have four leaflets

SUMMER&apos;S LOVER:
	Summer pissed off he wouldn&apos;t call her while at work, even though he explained he wasn&apos;t allowed to
	He talked me into carrying the phone for her, but she blew it when she called the accursed thing mine - from then on, I refused to carry it for any reason, and refused to answer it for months
	when I first needed to start shaving, Summer handed the razor to her lover and tried to get him to show me by doing it on me without even asking my consent - I felt *very* uncomfortable with this and did not allow it
	she was angry he wouldn&apos;t renounce his children for her and hers, and instead wanted a relationship with all of us - if I recall, that&apos;s what drove Summer to dump him, but my memory is hazy on this and it might have been something else
	Summer has always seemed to think she has the right to forbid people from liking the people she doesn&apos;t like
	she split up Vivian and one of her friends over a disagreement she&apos;d had with Vivian&apos;s friend, at least once

RANDOM:
	the spirit of adventure
	tan phase
	denied for a credit card due to having insufficient credit history
	portable games in bathroom - she thought I was masturbating, even thought I was masturbating while in bath
	vivian and I used to pretend to go on ghost hunts
	won a stuffed rabbit in an egg hunt - loved that thing
	parents took toy &quot;temporarily&quot;, but put it outside to mould
	ate too much candy, so mother put me on a candy diet
	spent nights playing video games when mother went off on long trip - maybe it was her trip to Texas (we&apos;re in Oregon)
	fast food bakes potatoes frequently - must have been expensive
	my mother was always against Apple, but then she got an iPhone as her first smartphone, and now refuses to try anything else
	I understand avoiding a particular product because you&apos;ve learned it doesn&apos;t work, but I don&apos;t understand gripping a product so hard you won&apos;t try anything else and learn whether it&apos;s better
	axe handle hidden in tree
	built tiles for old, defunct game
	Summer used to put stuff in our bedroom without telling us
	Summer was angry when I didn&apos;t include butter in macaroni that she wasn&apos;t even eating anyway
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;m a computer.
	You can see that.
	I am so hungry.
	I haven&apos;t eaten in weeks.
	Get in my disk drive,
	and I&apos;ll swallow.
	...
	can&apos;t remember the rest
	old logo - can&apos;t remember it well enough to replicate it - back when I had more creativity
