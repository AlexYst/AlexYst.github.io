			<h1>How I came to be a Debian user</h1>
			<p>Rehashing old memories</p>
		</header>
<p>
	This page is a mess.
	I&apos;m in the middle of construction, so there&apos;s much debris.
	Please ignore this page for now.
</p>
<p>
	When I was very young, Summer, my mother, bought a home computer.
	Home computers were pretty new back then.
	Probably pretty expensive, too.
	I mean, home computers these days are still pretty pricey, but they would have been much more so back then, when the technology was still new, and production methods weren&apos;t so efficient.
	As such, I, a small child, was told never to touch the thing.
	I didn&apos;t really know or care why at the time.
	And as I didn&apos;t know much about the thing, I had no real interest in it.
	I had no idea what power computers held, and they might not have even been good enough yet to be worth my time, in retrospect.
	What could I even do with the thing?
	Needless to say, this machine ran Windows.
	That&apos;ll be relevant later.
</p>
<p>
	In school, we started working with computers.
	Apple had donated a bunch of OS X machines to the school district, so that&apos;s what I grew up on: OS X.
	At some point, I was exposed to Windows.
	I don&apos;t remember the circumstances.
	But I found it a pain to work with, as I was used to OS X by then.
	Apple&apos;s computer-donation plan had worked well on me.
	Eventually, my father offered to buy me a laptop.
	He said he could either get me a brand-new Windows machine or, because they&apos;re so much more expensive, a used OS X machine.
	Needless to say, I went with the Apple laptop.
	I didn&apos;t care if it was used.
	Everything I owned already was used, so why should my laptop be any different?
</p>
<p>
	This machine didn&apos;t hold up well.
	he hinge was weak, and it started to break.
	The breaking hinge impacted use of the machine much more than I thought it would, at the time.
	The screen became increasingly tinted red, so I could barely see anything on it.
	By applying pressure in just the right places, I could restore enough of the picture to continue using the machine for a while, but even that became diminishing effective over time.
	I had to go without a computer for years, after that.
	I later found out that the hinge issue is a common Apple laptop issue.
	Their hardware looks sleek and fancy, and it certainly costs a lot, but it lacks durability, and isn&apos;t worth your money.
</p>
<p>
	There used to be a used computer store closer to my home.
	Out of luck, Summer and I stopped in there one day because she needed something.
	I forget what.
	They were clearing out old Apple desktop machines; the kind where the computer is built into the thick, oddly-shaped monitor.
	An iMac.
	These things were way old by this point, but they were exactly what I&apos;d grown up on at school.
	And they were only $20 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> each.
	So I bought one.
	I honestly had no idea just how outdated these things actually were.
	I hadn&apos;t been in school for a while, and hadn&apos;t seen the new Apple machines.
	I had no desk, and had to put it on my dresser.
	I had no chair, either, and sat on the nearby bed.
	It hurt my wrists to use the keyboard in such a setup, but at least I had a computer again.
</p>
<p>
	The thing ran OS X 10.4.11.
	The machine was so old that it couldn&apos;t be updated to any later system.
	I used the thing for a few years, always at the same version, so I still remember the operating system&apos;s version number.
	It&apos;s kind of funny.
	It was a <abbr title="Performance Optimisation With Enhanced RISC - Performance Computing">PowerPC</abbr> machine, and I found that most interesting software either didn&apos;t run on <abbr title="Performance Optimisation With Enhanced RISC - Performance Computing">PowerPC</abbr>, or didn&apos;t run on systems that old.
	What really annoyed me about the software that wouldn&apos;t run on older operating systems though was that most of it didn&apos;t even tell what the cutoff point was numerically.
	For example, a piece of software might claim to run on &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; or later.
	What does that even mean?
	10.4.11, my system, was part of the range given the code name &quot;Tiger&quot;.
	But how do I compare them?
	Is &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; earlier or later than &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;?
	Version code names suck, and there&apos;s no good reason to use them.
	Please, <em>*please*</em>, <strong>*please*</strong>, always specify things using version numbers, and not those ridiculous code names.
	You might think it&apos;s fine for your use case.
	It&apos;s not.
	It&apos;s definitely not.
	As an example, Ubuntu&apos;s versions are given by Canonical code names with the first letter beginning with the next letter in the order of the English alphabet.
	So you might think it&apos;s easy to compare code names and figure out where they fall in relation to one another.
	<strong>BUT NOT EVERYONE *KNOWS* THAT CANONICAL DOES THIS!!</strong>
	Please don&apos;t expect everyone to be in the loop.
	There are new users, as well as long-time users.
	Version numbers are <strong>*always*</strong> easier and more-intuitive to compare.
</p>
<p>
	Summer always got annoyed that I preferred OS X over Windows.
	But what did she expect?
	I&apos;d been raised on OS X, and it was so much better of a system.
	I mean, Apple hardware was apparently garbage, and that&apos;s an issue, but OS X was built up from a solid <abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr> foundation.
	It wasn&apos;t <abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr>-compatible by any means, but it had that strong, UNIX-like base, making it run a thousand times better than Windows will probably <strong>*ever*</strong> run.
	I hadn&apos;t been exposed to Windows as a young child, and as she herself has such a hard time adapting to change, she should have very-easily seen how she&apos;d contributed to being a Mac person by making sure I was exposed to OS X and <strong>*only*</strong> OS X.
</p>
<p>
	I learned the basics of a lot of things on that machine.
	I got my start in pixel art, for example.
	I tried a couple different image editors.
	The <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr> was the one I started with, but it was a major pain to work with.
	At the time, I thought this the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr>&apos;s fault, but I&apos;d later learn that the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr> works fantastically on Linux.
	I think the problem was the X system for OS X.
	X got ported to OS X, and you had to install X because the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr> depended on it.
	I forget what the port was called, but it didn&apos;t play nicely with OS X&apos;s native graphics system, and if I recall, merely mousing over a window automatically bringing focus to it, making multi-window applications such as the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr> painful to use.
	It might have also defocused windows when you move the cursor off of them, but I don&apos;t recall for sure.
	I ended up switching to Seashore rather quickly.
	It&apos;s a dumbed-down image editor that reuses source code from the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr>.
	While it has less options than the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr>, it&apos;s also made specifically to run well on OS X, though that&apos;s the <strong>*only*</strong> system it runs on.
</p>
<p>
	I also got started with Web languages, including <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
	My first website was hosted on this old iMac, and I used OS X&apos;s built-in Apache and <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> instances to do it, at first.
	These instances were hopelessly entangled with the system though, so when I discovered how outdated my <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> instance was, and that my Apache instance was too old for then-modern <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, I ended up having to compile and install a second copy of both <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> and Apache, leaving the system-included ones installed but disabled.
</p>
<p>
	I often found my iMac wasn&apos;t powerful enough to do the things I wanted it to do.
	I couldn&apos;t even watch videos on it, for example, so when I started taking one of the first <abbr title="massive open online course">MOOC</abbr>s in the world, the machine wasn&apos;t up to the task.
	By then, I&apos;d gotten a desktop Mac, which I mainly used as a server, but it couldn&apos;t connect to Wi-Fi, so it had to live under Summer&apos;s desk, where the router was housed.
	So I typically didn&apos;t have access to this machine physically, and it ran headless most of the time.
	I barely got her to let me use it to take the course, so I wasn&apos;t going to be able to get her to let me use it for anything else.
	At some point, my pibling gave me a pair of old laptops, so I&apos;d have something powerful enough to use, but also Wi-Fi compatible.
	The catch was that they both ran Windows.
	<strong>*That*</strong> wasn&apos;t going to happen.
	So I looked into how to install OS X on them, planning to buy a copy of the system for at least one of the machines.
</p>





<p>
	Web-based game
	used laptop from pibling - ran windows, not going to work
	researched how to install OS X - turned out to be illegal
	Ubuntu 12.04 for a week - then realised I didn&apos;t have to commit
	Debian 6
	Mint 13?
	Xubuntu ... not sure what version by then
	Trisquel due to FSF endorsement, then abandoned it due to learning the FSF was full of crap
