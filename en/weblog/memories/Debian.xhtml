	This page is a mess.
	I&apos;m in the middle of construction, so there&apos;s much debris.
	Please ignore this page for now.
</p>
<p>
	When I was very young, Summer, my mother, bought a home computer.
	Home computers were pretty new back then.
	Probably pretty expensive, too.
	I mean, home computers these days are still pretty pricey, but they would have been much more so back then, when the technology was still new, and production methods weren&apos;t so efficient.
	As such, I, a small child, was told never to touch the thing.
	I didn&apos;t really know or care why at the time.
	And as I didn&apos;t know much about the thing, I had no real interest in it.
	I had no idea what power computers held, and they might not have even been good enough yet to be worth my time, in retrospect.
	What could I even do with the thing?
	Needless to say, this machine ran Windows.
	That&apos;ll be relevant later.
</p>
<p>
	In school, we started working with computers.
	Apple had donated a bunch of OS X machines to the school district, so that&apos;s what I grew up on: OS X.
</p>
<p>
	Web-based game
	later annoyed I never got into Windows, which is what she uses, but all I was exposed to was OS X at school and wasn&apos;t allowed to use any Windows computer
	father gave me choice of laptop
	screen went all red, until eventually unusable
	laptop with bad hinge - later learned this was a common Apple problem
	old Apple computer OS X 10.4.11
	used laptop from pibling - ran windows, not going to work
	researched how to install OS X - turned out to be illegal
	Ubuntu 12.04 for a week - then realised I didn&apos;t have to commit
	Debian 6
	Mint 13?
	Xubuntu ... not sure what version by then
	Trisquel due to FSF endorsement, then abandoned it due to learning the FSF was full of crap
