<p>
	This page is a mess.
	I&apos;m in the middle of construction, so there&apos;s much debris.
	Please ignore this page for now.
</p>
<p>
	If you&apos;ve read a lot of my journal entries, you&apos;ve probably been under the distinct impression that I can&apos;t stand telephones.
	This impression would be absolutely correct.
	I have a deep-seated distaste for telephones that goes way back to my childhood.
	I still find telephone calls to be rather inconvenient, but I go to far greater inconveniences and hassles just to avoid telephone calls because I can&apos;t stand how ridiculous the telephone system is set up on a technical level.
	Your chat handle isn&apos;t a human-meaningful sting.
	It&apos;s a number.
	but it&apos;s not a machine-meaningful number either, and has to be looked up in lookup tables before the telephone call can be routed.
	It&apos;s the worst of both worlds.
	I&apos;d put up with telephones if they at least used <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> so proper, human-meaningful, and sub-nameable strings could be used.
	But even if that were the case, I&apos;d definitely not take delight in taking or placing telephone calls.
	And I especially wouldn&apos;t appreciate people pestering me with telephone calls or <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> when I was out and about.
	Below are a few stories of my past past dealings with telephones.
	I don&apos;t think any of them really shaped my opinion of the technology, but they show that my distaste for telephones is nothing new.
</p>
<p>
	I remember Summer used to go on outings with Vivian, searching for hidden objects using <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> coordinates, and leave me behind.
	I was never the golden child.
	I asked to come along, but never got a chance to.
	Eventually, she picked up the pace, and would get dozens in one go.
	Vivian could do that, as she&apos;d worked her way up to that point with Summer, but I didn&apos;t want to go anymore, as on the odd occasion in which she&apos;s take me, which she started doing rarely, I had to jump from not doing any of the hunts to suddenly being stuck on a trip where I had to do tonnes of them.
	I hadn&apos;t built up the stamina nor the patience for it.
	I couldn&apos;t stand it when she finally took me, so I stopped asking, and didn&apos;t go often.
	But summer would phone home for whatever reason, often to give pointless information that wasn&apos;t relevant or useful to anything.
	And while I heard the telephone ring, I ignored it.
	It wasn&apos;t my telephone line and wasn&apos;t my problem.
	And I didn&apos;t want to deal with telephone calls.
	But then Vivian snitched on me, and told Summer I always ignored the telephone.
	After that, Summer made me always go listen to the answering machine if she was out and the telephone rang.
	If it was her, I was required to answer.
	I could hear the telephone from just about anywhere in the house, but to make out who was calling, I had to run to the room the telephone was in.
	I hated being a slave to that infernal device.
</p>
<p>
	When cellphones (actual cellular telephones, not these so-called &quot;smartphones&quot; that aren&apos;t telephones at all, but pocket computers) were first coming out, Summer was vocal about how terrible they were, and how they were a blight on society.
	People would use them while driving, putting people in jeopardy, et cetera.
	And I don&apos;t recall for sure, but she might have thought that people don&apos;t need to be tethered to everyone else when they&apos;re out and about.
	How clingy.
	But maybe I&apos;m just projecting, because I don&apos;t like people being able to pester me no matter where I am.
	If I&apos;m not at home, you can wait until I get home to pester me.
	Seriously.
	But then she got a cellphone.
	And she liked it.
	If I recall, she got it for emergency situations while she was out in the woods looking for hidden objects with her <abbr title="Global Positioning System receiver">GPSr</abbr>, but I honestly don&apos;t remember for sure.
	And that&apos;s when she hated on <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>.
	It was a lazy way to communicate, not to mention that it was expensive.
	And her friends were inconsiderate.
	She kept telling them not to text message her, because she got charged for it, and to call instead.
	But they wouldn&apos;t listen, and she had to foot the bill.
	She wonders why I hate <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>, but honestly, she hated <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> too and was very vocal about it.
	I don&apos;t hate it for the same reasons, and I don&apos;t hate it because of her, but it&apos;s odd she doesn&apos;t consider that she might be the reason I hate it; that she rubbed off on me before changing her mind.
	But yeah, she kept telling her friends not to <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> her, and kept telling them about how it cost her money to receive these messages whether she wanted them or not, and how her carrier wouldn&apos;t let her block them.
	She&apos;s always been a Verizon customer, and we all know how Verizon screws over their customers every chance they get.
	Eventually, she gave in and sprung for the unlimited <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> plan, which cost more than what she wanted to pay, but less than what she was getting charged because of her inconsiderate friends.
	After that, <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> started to grow on her.
	These days, she seems to think it&apos;s the best thing ever, and it seems to be her favourite way to communicate.
	If you try to reach her another way, such as via email, she tends to get a bit weird about it.
	Now, she doesn&apos;t understand how someone could not want a cellphone, not want to carry one everywhere, not want to communicate via telephone call, or not enjoy sending and receiving <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages.
	I&apos;ve never known her to have a problem with placing or taking telephone calls, and she seemed to like that method of communication even when landlines were the only telephony option, but the rest of that?
	She was opposed to all of it at one point, yet lacks the empathy now to see why anyone might not enjoy conforming to this new societal norm.
</p>
<p>
	When I was in high school, I had a gay friend who really liked to talk via telephone.
	I got enough of them during the school day, and while I&apos;d be happy to have them over at my place or happy to go over to theirs if Summer wasn&apos;t against my visiting or taking visitors, dealing with them via telephone was always a huge drag.
	And they liked to talk for over an hour at time.
	They tended only to get off once Summer complained we were tying up the line and made me get off the telephone.
	I always found that to be a huge relief; the call was finally over.
	These telephone calls were probably the most boring thing I had to deal with.
	Summer thought this friend had a crush on me.
	And in retrospect, she was probably right.
	But I had no sexuality back then, and was completely oblivious to that sort of thing.
	Even now, I&apos;m pretty oblivious to it.
	And if you&apos;re trying to woo me, making me sit on hour-long telephone calls is no way to do it.
	I can&apos;t stand telephone calls, and the longer they are, the worse I find them to be.
