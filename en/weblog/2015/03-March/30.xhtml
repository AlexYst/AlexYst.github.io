			<h1>PayPal accepts my payment?</h1>
			<p>Day 00023: Monday, 2015 March 30</p>
		</header>
</p>
	I have now sent PayPal a letter from the email address I used to purchase the original album.
	Making that happen was much easier than I thought.
	Zoho has an option to add an email alias from the same domain as the main address.
	After doing that, the Web mail system allows you to send email from that new address.
	I assumed I would need to set up a second inbox, but that was not the case.
	I also sent a message to Bandcamp explaining that PayPal stopped processing my payments and asked that they please add a second method of payment.
	We&apos;ll see how that goes.
</p>
</p>
	I have not gotten a response to either of these parties, but I tried to purchase another album.
	Oddly enough, it went through this time.
	I now have <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/losing-salt">Losing Salt by Mark With a C</a>.
</p>
</p>
	I feel like a lot happened today, but I&apos;m tired and can&apos;t remember it.
	I might have more to say about today tomorrow.
</p>
</p>
	I don&apos;t seem to have much to say today, but I can still <a href="/a/canary.txt">say it freely</a>.
