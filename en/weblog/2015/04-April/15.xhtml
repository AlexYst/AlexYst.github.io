<p>
	I finally added the links to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> validators to the bottom of all my <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> pages on the site.
	As I said before, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> validator doesn&apos;t handle validation of <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr> pages well, so this effort was in vain.
	However, it&apos;s more of a token effort than anything.
	At this point, the problem now lies solely on their end, as the issue on mine (the lack of links) has been resolved.
	I would say that the problem could be because of my self-signed certificate, but the validators choked on my last site too.
	My last site used a commercial certificate with a verified chain of trust leading back to a known certificate authority.
</p>
<p>
	My friend from the other day that wanted his/her name and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> removed from my site mentioned that he/she didn&apos;t want Googlebot finding more references to his/her identity than was necessary.
	I don&apos;t use Google&apos;s search engine usually, but because Googlebot was specifically the problem, I did a search for my own site.
	I didn&apos;t think that any results would come up, as I figured Google wouldn&apos;t trust my self-signed certificate and would avoid indexing this place.
	I was wrong.
	Google has in fact indexed some of the pages here, though not most of them.
	The <a href="/weblog/2015/04-April/13.xhtml">problematic page</a> has not as of today been indexed, so the redaction was made in time.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
