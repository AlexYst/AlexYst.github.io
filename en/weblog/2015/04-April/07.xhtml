<p>
	The first of Josh Woodward&apos;s ZIP files finished downloading late last night, but I didn&apos;t have time to examine its contents much until today.
	The ZIP file appears to be too large for either Xarchiver or Xfce&apos;s &quot;Extract Here&quot; option.
	Xarchiver simply hangs unresponsively, appearing to be frozen.
	Xfce&apos;s &quot;Extract Here&quot; silently fails.
	My guess is there is just so much stuff in the ZIP file that these programs can&apos;t handle it.
	As usual, <code>unzip</code> on the command line works flawlessly.
</p>
<p>
	Once the files were extracted, I noticed that despite this being the full <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> version ZIP file, several MP3s were present.
	The first thing I did was sort all the files using Ex Falso to make them easier to look through.
	Five files had renaming conflicts due to sharing titles: <code>JoshWoodward-AmaranthineYouFly-2.mp3</code>, <code>JoshWoodward-AmaranthineYouFly-3.mp3</code>, <code>JoshWoodward-DeadCode-3.mp3</code> <code>JoshWoodward-DeadCode-4.mp3</code>, and <code>JoshWoodward-DeadCode.mp3</code>.
	The last three were obviously Josh Woodward&apos;s song <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/song/DeadCode">Dead Code</a>, which while is an awesome, nerdy, up-beat tune, is one I&apos;ve heard before.
	The former two were of more immediate interest, because I&apos;ve never heard that song.
	As the file names imply and the files&apos; meta data confirm, they contain a song called <code>Amaranthine, You Fly</code>.
	I have never heard of this song before, and it is not one that Josh seems to sell on <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/">his website</a> aside from in this bundle.
</p>
<p>
	I listened to <code>JoshWoodward-AmaranthineYouFly-2.mp3</code> first, and found it to be a haunting and beautiful instrumental song.
	I believed this to be the full song, not an instrumental version, as it was in the full version ZIP, but upon listening to <code>JoshWoodward-AmaranthineYouFly-3.mp3</code>, I found the song does have lyrics after all.
	I also listened to the Dead Code files, finding <code>JoshWoodward-DeadCode-3.mp3</code> to be instrumental, while <code>JoshWoodward-DeadCode-4.mp3</code> and <code>JoshWoodward-DeadCode.mp3</code> were the full version.
	On the command line, I used <code>diff</code> to verify that the two with-vocals Dead Code files were identical.
	Based on this, I think that the number appended to the file names represent how complete the song is.
	the &quot;4&quot; version of Dead Code became the final, while the &quot;3&quot; version didn&apos;t yet have vocals.
	In that case, the &quot;2&quot; version of Amaranthine, You Fly isn&apos;t missing vocals because it&apos;s the instrumental version, but because it&apos;s a snapshot from before the vocals were added.
	A <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> copy of the complete song is included, so I&apos;ll conver that to Vorbis and probably not touch the MP3s again.
	I might grab the instrumental version from the instrumental <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> ZIP file though because of how lovely it is.
	Why does Josh not sell this song along with the others though? It&apos;s a very beautiful piece and I think a lot of people would buy it.
</p>
<p>
	Next, I went through the albums to sort out the files that corresponded to Vorbis files I already have.
	I will keep the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files in storage in case I decide to create directive works or use them in videos or something, but for now, my goal was to find the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files that have no Vorbis counterpart on the site and create one to add to my music player.
	While doing this, I noticed that there was no &quot;Here Today&quot; album, but instead, a &quot;Here Today (Remixed)&quot; album.
	I can&apos;t hear any audible difference between the songs in &quot;Here Today&quot; and &quot;Here Today (Remixed)&quot;, but the songs differ in length by a couple seconds.
	I kind of wonder if &quot;Here Today (Remixed)&quot; is a legacy album title from near when Josh first redid his older albums.
	The <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files may not have been updated because they don&apos;t get seen as often.
	I debated about putting both versions on my player, but they are for all intents and purposes identical, so I stuck with &quot;Here Today&quot;, as it is already in Vorbis version.
</p>
<p>
	Next, I found the &quot;She Lost Her Wings&quot; and &quot;California Lullaby (Single)&quot; albums, both of which contained only a single MP3 file.
	I opted instead to just use the &quot;The Beautiful Machine&quot; album, which contains both singles and is in <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> format.
	I imagine these singles were likely released prior to The Beautiful Machine being released.
	It&apos;s likely that all the singles Josh has been releasing lately will likewise find their way onto the next album.
	&quot;Ashes&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Machine&quot;, my two missing Woodward albums, were included in <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> format.
	&quot;Gangnam Style&quot; contained a single MP3, and &quot;Unreleased&quot; contained nothing but MP3s.
	Many of the songs in Unreleased were already added to The Beautiful Machine, so I just kept the copy from the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> The beautiful Machine.
</p>
<p>
	Lastly, I went through the files that were not part of an album, most of them due to missing album/song title meta data.
	Again, I found many duplicates between the missing-meta <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files and the &quot;Unreleased&quot; MP3s.
	I kept the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files, and my sorting was at last done.
	One file I expected to see, but didn&apos;t, was the alternate version of Golden Sunrise.
	It appears this version is reserved for people that sign up for Josh&apos;s mailing list and is available only in MP3 format.
	Ex Falso messes up the file names of any file missing a track title if the title is used in the naming pattern, so I fixed the file names on these files.
	I don&apos;t exactly understand the syntax of <code>find . -name &quot;*flac&quot; -exec oggenc {} \;</code>, but I used it to convert the files to Vorbis, then added the new music to my player.
</p>
<p>
	I will save the next ZIP file for another treasure hunt tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
	Josh Woodward also released several new songs today.
	I can&apos;t really comment on them due to my line being tied up by the continuing download of his ZIPs.
	(They should be finished downloading by tomorrow.) The first is only a preview, so if you want to hear it, you&apos;ll need to join his Patreon fund-raising.
	The second is <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/song/TheRivalWithin">The Rival Within</a>.
	After posting these two songs, he sent out links to The Rival Within, <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/song/TooManyValleys">Too Many Valleys</a> (the song from the other day), and a new one called <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/song/HoneyedTongue">Honeyed Tongue</a>, a song present in the ZIP file but which I had not heard about before.
	I tried to load the videos to the songs, but the connection was just too busy.
	I did, however, notice that in the &quot;related videos&quot; section, a video for &quot;Amaranthine, You Fly&quot; showed up.
	I&apos;m not sure why it wasn&apos;t available on Josh&apos;s website at the time I checked for it, but it&apos;s not a secret song and very likely will be added to the site if it has not been already.</p>
<p>
	<a href="/a/canary.txt">Nothing happened today that the government is interested in trying to get me to hide.</a>
	I pretty much just explored awesome music files, unable to get online much due to continued downloading.
