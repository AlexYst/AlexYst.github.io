			<h1>Freeminer won&apos;t compile and the Freeminer community is unwelcoming</h1>
			<p>Day 00158: Wednesday, 2015 August 12</p>
		</header>
<p>
	Someone on the Minetest forums wants several new graphical lighting effects to be added to the engine, and someone else said that some of those effects are being worked on already in a Minetest fork called Freeminer.
	I decided to try Freeminer to see what it looked like, but I couldn&apos;t get the game to compile.
	I tried visiting the Freeminer forums for help, but Freeminer seems to have banned us Tor users.
	The community there simply is not a welcoming place.
	I tried a few more things to get Freeminer to compile, but I gave up quickly.
	I&apos;m not going to have much fun with the game without a community to play it with, so there really wouldn&apos;t be much point in putting a lot off effort into it.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;ve found that growing trees often causes bugs in the lighting, causing huge shadows to appear where trees have grown.
	When growing forests during map generation, this happens almost every time, causing the whole world&apos;s surface to go dark.
	When growing individual trees using an active block modifier, this happens much less often, though still happens occasionally.

<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
