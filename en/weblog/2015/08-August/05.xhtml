			<h1>Two weeks notice</h1>
			<p>Day 00151: Wednesday, 2015 August 05</p>
		</header>
<p>
	I received a letter stating that my shipment from Marc With a C went out today.
	Last time, I already had the music in digital form pretty quickly, but now, I actually have to wait for the shipment in order to get my hands on the cover album, which I will probably unwrap, copy the music files from, then never touch again out of fear of scratching the <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr>.
	Postal mail seems like such a weird way to get music!
</p>
<p>
	It seems that we now have a date for our move.
	We need to be in Coos Bay by the twenty-first of this month.
	I have now put in my two weeks notice with my current employer, so my last day there is the nineteenth.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;ve been working with my broken stamp as of late, and it has been nice in that positioning the mark it leaves has been much easier.
	However, using the broken stamp leaves a mess of ink all over my fingers and thumbs.
	I&apos;ve decided that indeed a replacement is in order.
	I picked up a new one today, but I still have the little rubber characters from the first one.
	By using both sets of characters, I was able to spell out my web address twice on the new one! I could have made it three if I left off the trailing slash on the address, but it wouldn&apos;t have been worth it.
	I&apos;ll try to be more careful with version 1.0 of my stamp (the original would have been version 0.0).
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
