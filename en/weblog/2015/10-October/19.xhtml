	I downloaded the <a href="https://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/SDK">Replicant <abbr title="software development kit">SDK</abbr> and <abbr title="Android Developer Tools">ADT</abbr> plugin</a> and installed the necessary software from the Debian repository to set them up.
	I haven&apos;t put everything together yet, but I hope that with the new software in Debian 8, everything will run smoothly.
	In Debian 7, I was unable to make the Replicant <abbr title="software development kit">SDK</abbr> function.
	I&apos;m not sure if Debian having newer software versions will make the old Replicant <abbr title="software development kit">SDK</abbr> work better or worse, but I have high hopes.
</p>
<p>
	I set up an account on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/i/a478b7755d8c5aa576c6fe528bc3f283">Coursera</a> so I could take a few computer science and Web development courses, but the videos on the website do not seem to play.
	I&apos;ve written asking for help, so hopefully this can be figured out and I can learn a few things.
</p>
<p>
	I spent much of the day working on Esperanto lessons.
	They got tedious quickly, but I&apos;m going to try to power through them over the next while.
	It&apos;s been quite a while since I&apos;ve had time to put any real effort into learning this language.
	I&apos;ve been working on one lesson or refresher session each day, but that really isn&apos;t a whole lot.
	It would be nice to become fluent enough in Esperanto that I can finally get the Esperanto version of this Website set up.
	I moved everything into the <code>/en/</code> directory quite a while ago in preparation to set up an Esperanto version at <code>/eo/</code>, but thst still has not happened.
</p>
<p>
	At the end of the day, I set up information pages about my three domains and three computers.
	I don&apos;t think that they will be overly useful, but it gave me something to do to take my mind off of Esperanto for a while.
	These pages were for <a href="/en/domains/y.st.xhtml">y.st.</a>, <a href="/en/domains/quystystxtvdgyst.onion.xhtml">quystystxtvdgyst.onion.</a>, <a href="/en/domains/chicken.local.xhtml">chicken.local.</a>, <a href="/en/domains/thinkpad-x60s.local.xhtml">thinkpad-x60s.local.</a>, <a href="/en/domains/newdawn.local.xhtml">newdawn.local.</a>, and <a href="/en/domains/ystyst.mp.xhtml">ystyst.mp.</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
