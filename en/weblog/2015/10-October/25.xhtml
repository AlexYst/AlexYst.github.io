			<h1>Unable to bank online yet</h1>
			<p>Day 00232: Sunday, 2015 October 25</p>
		</header>
<p>
	When I set up my Banner Bank account, I did not yet have Internet access.
	Because of this, I did not set up my online banking account right away.
	After getting Internet access, I still procrastinated though.
	Now,I do not seem to recall the information I need to get in, so I will need to stop by the branch tomorrow to see what can be done.
</p>
<p>
	The <abbr title="Open and Free Technology Community">OFTC</abbr> network keeps booting me for some reason, though I am not sure exactly why.
	As a result, my <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> client tries again each time, successfully connecting to the network only to be booted once more.
	It seems to be a technical issue, not a ban, so I eventually make it back on and stay on.
	However, some people in <a href="ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697/%23nottor">#nottor</a> apparently got annoyed by the join and part messages, so the people in charge of that channel banned me.
	I&apos;m not sure why join/part messages annoy some people, but I wish that they would get over it.
	When I see a long line of join/part messages from someone else, it doesn&apos;t bother me, let alone make me want to ban them over something that they cannot control.
	At least I wasn&apos;t banned from <a href="ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697/%23tor">the main Tor channel</a> though.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
