			<h1>A reasonable Git host and a bug in <code>localhost</code></h1>
			<p>Day 00215: <time>Thursday, 2015 October 08</time></p>
		</header>
<p>
	Finally, I have located a Git host that hosts using free software! <a href="https://notabug.org/">NotABug.org</a> hosts code using a modified version of <a href="http://gogs.io/">Gogs</a>.
	Even the <a href="https://notabug.org/hp/gogs/">modified version</a> is made available.
	Gogs seems like working Git-hosting software, seeing as it&apos;s being used by a Git-hosting service, but is the Gogs code hosted using the Gogs software? No! Instead, for some reason, they are hosted on Github.
	I find this very sad, personally.
	It feels as if the Gogs development team doesn&apos;t have enough faith in their software to use it.
	In any case, I won&apos;t complain too much because I now have something I&apos;ve been looking for for quite a while and it is partially thanks to these developers.
	I&apos;ll get mu code uploaded there when I have time.
</p>
<p>
	I went in to speak with the manager that is hiring at the mall, and it seems she was not expecting me.
	I wonder if the employee I spoke with didn&apos;t actually let her know that I was coming.
	I somehow got a bad vibe, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to get the job.
	I will come back on Monday to check on my resume that I left with her today though.
	She said in the next one to two weeks, she will be hiring two or three people, so if I&apos;m luckier than I feel, I could be one of them.
</p>
<p>
	Before I left for the mall, I set up my machine to install Debian while I was away.
	This time, it made it past the point that it got stuck yesterday, and when I got home, it was waiting for me to enter a disk-encryption password.
	The install finished smoothly, after which I found some instructions for <a href="https://debian-administration.org/article/28/Making_scripts_run_at_boot_time_with_Debian">making scripts run at boot time</a> and set up a script to start the script that repeatedly calls eschalot.
	Maybe I&apos;ll find better onions, maybe I won&apos;t, but I&apos;ll find something if I leave the machine turned on long enough.
	Before taking it up to my bedroom, I forgot to install the software needed for the Debian machine to speak with my Replicant device and my brother&apos;s Android device, but if we end up needing it, I can drag it back down to the Ethernet cord and modem.
	It seems that the Debian team has fixed whatever bug in Debian 8 was making this machine&apos;s fan stay turned on at full blast all the time.
	The fan now works as it should at a reasonable level.
</p>
<p>
	It seems that <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/46186"><abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr> is now compatible with the <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> <abbr title="General Public License">GPL</abbr></a>! This is awesome news.
</p>
<p>
	I was looking into the specifications for the use of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/special-use-domain-names/special-use-domain-names.xml">special-use domain names</a> again, and was reminded of the fact that <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761">all subdomains of <code>//localhost</code> should resolve to the loopback address</a>, not just <code>//localhost</code> itself.
	I decided to test this out by pinging <code>//test.localhost</code>.
	Oddly, the address resolved to <code>198.105.244.24</code>, an address that was not responding to pings.
	This is the same address my mother&apos;s Windows machine was resolving all non-self <abbr title="multicast Domain Name System">mDNS</abbr> names to.
	I checked the special-use <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address space by comparing the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address to the domain space corresponding to special-use <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, but there was no match.
	I couldn&apos;t find much on the Web either, aside from the fact that the IP address is owned by a company called <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/198.105.244.24">Search Guide Inc</a>.
	These guys seem to be pretty under-the-<abbr title="Radio Detection And Ranging">radar</abbr>; I can&apos;t find any information on them.
	I tried loading both <code>//host0.localhost</code> and the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address in my browser.
	Both redirect to a search page run by my <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>.
	My browser trusted the <code>//host0.localhost</code> address because it is a subdomain of the trusted <code>//localhost</code> address, so it didn&apos;t get proxied.
	After all, if connections to localhost were sent through <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>, they&apos;d never reach their intended destination.
</p>
<p>
	Debian isn&apos;t implementing the <abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr>, so the localhost <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> is not functioning correctly, or probably at all.
	My guess is that the only reason that connections to the bare <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> <code>//localhost</code> seem to work correctly is because <code>localhost</code> is in the hosts file, overriding the default behavior.
	Out of curiosity, I checked on my Mother&apos;s Windows machine, and it has the same issue, aside from the fact that the bare <code>//localhost</code> domain worked without a hosts file entry.
	Queries to &quot;{domain}.localhost&quot; are being treated by both systems as regular <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> nams to ask the name server about.
	Also, it seems my <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> is evilly selling queries to unused domains instead of returning a response stating that the domain does not exist.
	The <abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> also states that the name servers should return the loopback address for queries for localhost names if a machine fails to recognize the names themselves, so my <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> is doing things incorrectly as well.
	Lastly, it seems that instead of querying the local network over multicast, the Windows machine is asking the name server for names in the <code>//local.</code> name space, explaining why it can&apos;t find the actual local machines.
	I have no idea why it&apos;s able to find it&apos;s own multicast name, but my guess is that if it&apos;s not handling multicast names properly, it&apos;s probably not listening for its own multicast name properly either.
	Hopeful that means that the Debian implementation of multicast domains is functioning correctly and is not only compatible with itself.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;ve sent a bug report to the Debian team to see if they will fix this.
	I have to say, the Debian bug-reporting system is quite obtuse.
	I never could get the bug-reporting software itself to function, and I eventually had to try emailing the bug report system&apos;s automated box directly.
	THe first time, it rejected my report because it didn&apos;t like the way it was formatted, but it took the report the second time.
	Unfortunately, the bug quickly got downgraded to &quot;wishlist&quot; status.
	We may not get full localhost support in Debian for a while.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;ve been meaning to say this for a while, but I keep forgetting.
	I looked at the available payment history in my <a href="http://www.nic.st/">.ST Domain Registry</a> account, and it seems I understood the prices correctly the first time.
	The price was indeed lower per-year to buy for several years at a time.
	However, the prices have gone up, so there is no longer a discount for multi-year registration.
</p>
<p>
	The <a href="/en/URI_research/ccTLDs.xhtml#gt">Republic of Guatemala</a>&apos;s registry requires the telephone number field on their application form be filled, but it can be filled with the string &quot;no telephone available&quot;.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
