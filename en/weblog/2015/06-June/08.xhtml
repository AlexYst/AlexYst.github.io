			<h1>CREDO Mobile</h1>
			<p>Day 00093: <time>Monday, 2015 June 08</time></p>
		</header>
<p>
	I&apos;m going to make this short, because if I don&apos;t, I will never finish sorting my mail.
</p>
<p>
	CREDO Mobile wants us to <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/LWCF">save the Land and Water Conservation Fund</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/usa_freedom_2015">fight the <abbr title="Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection and Online Monitoring">USA FREEDOM</abbr> Act</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/2015breakupbanks">break up dangerously-large banks</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/tpp_medicare">prevent cuts to Medicare funding</a>, switch to CREDO Mobile for witreless service, <a href="https://www.credomobilize.com/petitions/ban-monsanto-s-toxic-roundup-herbicide-on-federal-land">ban the use of Monsanto&apos;s Roundup on federal land</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/debt_free_college">end student debt</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/obama_dont_drill_arctic">prevent oil drilling in the arctic</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/sunset_update">section 215 of the <abbr title="Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism">USA PATRIOT</abbr> Act die</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/shelbybill">keep Wall Street from running amok</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/Save_ESA">continue protecting endangered species</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/community_broadband_act">protect our right to municipal broadband</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/obama_sec/">appoint commissioners to the Securities and Exchange Commission that will actually do their jobs</a>, <a href="https://act.demandprogress.org/sign/no-fast-track-for-wall-street-credo">talk Trade Representative Michael Froman into a little transparency</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/tpp_toxics">protect public health from fast track legislation</a>, <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/kick_polluters_out">keep fossil fuel-promoting corporations from negatively impacting climate policy</a>, and <a href="https://act.credoaction.com/sign/dolwaivers">demand banks be held accountable for their illegal actions</a>.
</p>
<p>
	It turns out that CREDO Mobile is less evil than I thought.
	They do in fact offer a no-contract option that is less expensive than the contract option, due to the device price not being built into the service fee.
	They still have two fatal flaws that prevent me from switching, but at least they are potentially not a bad company.
	First and foremost, CREDO Mobile is a <abbr title="code division multiple access">CDMA</abbr> carrier.
	This means that they are not compatible with the only free mobile operating system I know of: Replicant.
	CREDO Mobile is still heavily pushing for potential customers to buy their iPhone 6 above any other device though, so they clearly don&apos;t understand the need for a free operating system.
	Second, they still, to the best of my knowledge, only have postpaid service.
	Postpaid plans give way too much power to the carrier, and if misused, that power given can be a liability.
	Prepaid service is much simpler and safer.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
