	Sorting through the first category of mail today, I found that all but one letter was either just more junk, dead end leads that looked like calls to action but didn&apos;t actually provide a way to take said action, or letters about campaigns that use telephony as their only way to take action.
	I refuse to even propagate such campaigns, such is my belief that the artificial dependence on telephone is idiotic.
	Everyone expects everyone else to have and want to use a telephone; this just keeps the idiotic telephone number system alive.
	Telephone numbers are basically just computer-readable network addresses for the telephone network.
	Would you use <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses only when browsing the Web? This has to end, and I think <abbr title="Session Initiation Protocol">SIP</abbr> addresses may be the way.
</p>
<p>
	The one good letter in this set of emails was from <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/">Josh Woodward</a> through <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yst">Patreon</a>.
	His new song, <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/song/WordsWeWillRemember">Words We Will Remember</a>, was released while I was out of commission.
	Before I went down, I mentioned a demo song that was not yet released to the public; this is it.
	I love the tune, but I especially love the lyrics of the chorus.
</p>
<p>
	I briefly considered starting to process a second category of email today, but I don&apos;t have time for that today.
	My work schedule has been pretty wacky and inconvenient lately, so I have less time available than I theoretically should.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
