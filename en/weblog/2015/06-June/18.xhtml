	<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/broadband-industry-loses-bid-to-stop-title-ii-net-neutrality-rules/">Net neutrality is officially in effect now</a>, but the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>s are fighting tooth and nail to get it repealed.
	At this point, they have somehow gotten anti-net neutrality legislation added to a bill designed to fund the government and keep it running.
	In its current state, if the bill passes, we lose net neutrality, while if the bill does not pass, the government shuts down because of lack of funding.
	<a href="https://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_congress_approp">We need to get the anti-net neutrality provisions removed from this bill!</a>
</p>
<p>
	Fast track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership are still looming over us as well.
	Please <a href="https://action.sumofus.org/a/house-tpp-fast-track/">contact your representatives</a> to let them know you are opposed to these and ask them to vote against them.
</p>
<p>
	The Daily Kos is currently recommending people install the proprietary Buycott application for one of their campaigns.
	Always read the fine print before joining a campaign.
	I&apos;ve <a href="https://twitter.com/YstDo/status/611688591840944128">asked the developers about releasing the application as free software</a>, though I doubt it will lead anywhere.
	Even if they release it freely, I can&apos;t personally use it because barcode scanning is <a href="https://redmine.replicant.us/issues/705">currently broken in Replicant</a>, but if they were at least not recommending a nonfree application, I might stand behind them on this campaign.
</p>
<p>
	The push to <a href="http://opentpp.org/">get the terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement reveled to the public continues</a>.
	We also need to <a href="https://campaigns.dailykos.com/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=1396">corporate funding of political attack advertisements brought to light</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
