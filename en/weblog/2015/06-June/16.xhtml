	Early this morning, before I had a chance to get to bed after a late night of work, I received a link to the first issue of a vegan magazine in my inbox via Twitter.
	I didn&apos;t think it would likely lead to anything, but I replied to the Twitter message mentioning that <a href="https://twitter.com/readandenjoyme/status/610749091971268608">I would love to see it under a <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution">CC BY</abbr> or <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr> license</a>.
	Any free license would be great, but many people don&apos;t understand what free licensing is, and it&apos;s easier just to give examples of what type of licensing I&apos;m looking for so people don&apos;t think I mean some sort of noncommercial verbatim copying license or something.
	Most people are stingy with copyrights though, so I didn&apos;t think my message would matter, but ReadAndEnjoy.me wrote back saying that in the next issue, they would include a message about all of their issues being under <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr>! I don&apos;t know if this license was their initial intent and they are just making it more clear or if they have added this license because of my message, but either way, I&apos;m happy.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
