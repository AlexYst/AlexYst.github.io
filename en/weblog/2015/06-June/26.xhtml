<p>
	Mistedwind showed me a social network called <a href="https://ello.co/">Ello</a> that commits to avoiding the data-harvesting practices that other social networks use to sell you to advertisers.
	They also do not require any information from you besides an email address.
	Any other information you enter is optional.
	Unlike with many of their competitors, that means to can use the service without turning over your legal name, a piece of information that should not be required just to use a web service.
</p>
<p>
	A coworker of mine told me that my current padlock and metal rope that I use to keep my bicycle from being stolen are not really secure and that I should invest in a U-lock.
	She said that these were available very inexpensively at some police stations, so I headed down to the one in my city.
	Unfortunately, it seems the station here doesn&apos;t carry them, but the receptionist offered me a gratis gun lock to use until I get something more secure.
	I think she thought I had no lock at all, as the gun lock is very thin, and my current setup looks more secure.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
