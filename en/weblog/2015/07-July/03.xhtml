			<h1>Whois privacy</h1>
			<p>Day 00118: Friday, 2015 July 03</p>
		</header>
<p>
	Apparently, <abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr> has been working on <a href="https://www.icann.org/public-comments/ppsai-initial-2015-05-05-en">new rules</a> to prevent the use of whois privacy for domains, though it&apos;s been mostly slipping beneath the <abbr title="Radio Detection And Ranging">radar</abbr>.
	The deadline for comments is almost here, the the box closes on the seventh of this month.
	I think I&apos;ll hold off on whiting in for a couple days to give myself more time to compose a decent letter, but we need to spread the word quickly while there is still time.
</p>
<p>
	The current whois system doesn&apos;t offer privacy in a very decent way, but it&apos;s better than no privacy at all.
	As the current rules stand, whois privacy requires use of a proxy company.
	This proxy company technically owns your domain and can do whatever they want with it without your consent.
	It is in their best interest to not screwing you over, as screwing you over would kill their reputation and harm their business, but it doesn&apos;t change the fact that you are left with two options: put your private information in the public database or trust a third-party company with ownership over your important piece of Internet real estate You also shouldn&apos;t have to pay to remain anonymous, but that is a lesser problem.
	We need to work on getting less information put into the whois databases, not work on making sure the information of private citizens is recorded and visible to all.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
