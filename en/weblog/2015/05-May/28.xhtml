<blockquote>
	<p>
		Day 17:
	</p>
	<p>
		I left my laptop with my coworker he said he might be able to fix it.
		He says that if he can&apos;t figure it out, perhaps his roommate can.
		Between the two of them, hopefully they can pick out what is wrong with the laptop, but I&apos;m not holding my breath.
		He said he will let me know if there&apos;s anything he can do with the laptop at noon on Saturday.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also finally managed to get ahold of my other coworker, the one selling the Windows 8 laptop.
		It seems he borrowed money from a friend, using a laptop as collateral.
		He said he can pay back the money to come serious about buying the laptop, but I have no way to see if the laptop&apos;s wireless card will function without proprietary firmware until after he pays back his friend.
		I can&apos;t put him in that situation without making a commitment, and there is a high probability that the laptops wireless card will not work.
		As a result, buying that laptop is out of the question.
	</p>
	<p>
		If my laptop cannot be repaired, I am strongly considering purchasing a brand new laptop that comes with Debian preinstalled.
		I&apos;ll install vrms to be sure that the system is using only free packages, but everything should work out of the box in that case.
