			<h1>Returning the MetroPCS tablet</h1>
			<p>Day 00069: Friday, 2015 May 15</p>
		</header>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Day 4:
	</p>
	<p>
		The tablet is now out of my hands and out of my hair.
		I had to take two trips to the MetroPCS store due to not having brought my micro<abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> cards with me the first time, but returning it was easier than I thought it would be.
		One of the issues I complained about was that there was no way to backup the tablets a day without a Google account.
		She thought that it was possible to back up to an SD card, but I didn&apos;t have my phone on me the first time and I did not want to buy a new one in store.
		we tried using me micro<abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card from my Replicant device, but I had forgotten that Android does not play well with micro<abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> cards that are formatted as ext4.
		There were a number of issues I pointed out, most of them having to do with the fact that without a Google account and without root access many basic essential tasks could not be performed.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few attempts to guess my Straight Talk <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card&apos;s default <abbr title="personal identification number">PIN</abbr>, I found it to be 1234.
		According to the Internet, AT&amp;T-based <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> cards typically use the <abbr title="personal identification number">PIN</abbr> <code>1111</code>, while T-Mobile based send cards tend to use instead the default pin <code>0000</code> or <code>1234</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When setting up my MetroPCS account two days ago, I was required to choose an eight digit <abbr title="personal identification number">PIN</abbr>.
		While I&apos;m no longer a MetroPCS customer, that has had a lasting effect on my use of <abbr title="personal identification number">PIN</abbr>s.
		I used to use a five-digit <abbr title="personal identification number">PIN</abbr>, but now it is up to seven digits.
