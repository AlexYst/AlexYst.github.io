		Day 7:
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried once again to use my old laptop to set up the bootable <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive.
		Again, the computer shut down prematurely.
		I found and borrowed my mother&apos;s old laptop, which has been malfunctioning since she got it.
		It&apos;s a horrid machine to consider for daily use, but it works perfectly fine for creating a bootable <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive when in a bind.
		It took a few hours, but the bootable <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive is ready.
	</p>
	<p>
		The letter from Marc with a C came a day late, but it did come.
		From the looks of it, my new yellow vinyl record has already been shipped.
		Mark said that this was a pre-order period, so I wouldn&apos;t have thought they could be shipping yet.
		Neither the main album download nor the bonus albums contain the bonus tracks from the record.
		he said that that they would be downloadable in digital form.
		I will have to inquire tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card cutter arrive today, quite a bit ahead of schedule.
		At this point, I have already learned that I did not need it, but it is still interesting to have.
		It came with two <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card adapters, but they seem to be low quality and potentially unsafe to use.
		that&apos;s not a huge concern though, as the important item in the package was the <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> cutter.
		Even the <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> cutter isn&apos;t of great importance though, and seems to have merely served as a plot device for my story.
		It&apos;s former absence was more important then its current presence.
