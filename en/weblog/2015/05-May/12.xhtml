			<h1><abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> cutting and a live <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr></h1>
			<p>Day 00066: Tuesday, 2015 May 12</p>
		</header>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Day 1:
	</p>
	<p>
		I went around town looking for a place that sells <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> cutters.
		It was a long shot, but if I could find a <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> cutter, I could reestablish my mobile Internet connection sooner.
		 As expected, I did not find a single place that sold them.
		T-mobile said that they can cut a <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card for me, but that they do not sell <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> cutters.
		The thing is though, it is not a T-Mobile <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card that I need cut.
		Would they be willing to cut a competitor&apos;s <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card? I didn&apos;t ask today, but I will probably ask tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my bosses gave me a great idea.
		Basically, all I have to do to find out if one of the computers at the recycling center can handle Debian is bring a live system on a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive.
		This will greatly speed up the process of finding a new laptop.
		Due do to complications, I should probably speak with my mother before doing anything.
		I will be therefor probably not be headed to the recycling center tomorrow as I had planned yesterday.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was messing with some settings on my mobile when the thing went into a reboot loop.
		With the help of my brother, I took a crash course on Replicant recovery mode.
		Unfortunately, recovery mode seems to have erased all my accounts, but at least the mobile is out of the reboot loop so I did not lose any major data.
	</p>

	I couldn&apos;t update my <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> today, as I was cut off from my Web/ssh server.
