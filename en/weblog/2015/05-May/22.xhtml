<blockquote>
	<p>
		Day 11:
	</p>
	<p>
		After getting lost several times, my sister and I made it to the recycling center.
		They only had one Linux laptop there, a machine running Zorin <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr>.
		I was excited to see that was only $99, but when I checked it with the bootable <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive, I found that the wireless card does not work without proprietary firmware not present in Debian.
		I asked the people there about getting a machine custom built, but they said that any machine they built would still require the proprietary firmware.
		I highly doubt this, chance alone would dictate that some laptop wireless cards they got in would work just fine without proprietary firmware.
		However, it is clear that they will not attempt to build me a machine does not require this firmware.
		They recommended looking for machines online, which is the only other thing I can think to do.
		I refuse to buy one of their Windows machines, as my money would be put toward paying Microsoft to license me software that I would never use and would be erasing immediately.
		The only places to look online that I know of only offer brand new computers though, which are much more expensive.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was a long trip, my body hurts now, and I didn&apos;t even get what I went there for.
		However, the trip was well worth it, both for the fun outing and to prove that I don&apos;t need to burn fossil fuels to run my errands.
