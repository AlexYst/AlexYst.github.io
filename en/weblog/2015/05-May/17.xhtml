<blockquote>
	<p>
		Day 6:
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, my canary expires, and there&apos;s not really anything I can do about it.
		Once I get back online, I&apos;ll modify my canary terms to allow for technical difficulties such as these.
		I&apos;m thinking that one missed day should mean I&apos;m being lazy.
		One missed week means I&apos;m having technical difficulties.
		One missed month means I&apos;m actually in trouble and needed help.
	</p>
	<p>
		A coworker of mine has had experience with prepaid debit cards and shares my desire for privacy.
		It turns out that if you call card support instead of trying to activate through the Web interface, you can outright tell the support staff that you refuse to hand over your Social Security number.
		My coworker told them that they had to put the money on the card because he had already paid.
		They actually did as he asked, and he had a working prepaid card without a Social Security number, and the card was even under the name &quot;Batman&quot;.
		Obviously, your mileage may vary, but it sounds like its worth looking into if I ever need to leave discover behind, though I&apos;d need to find a public telephone to do so.
