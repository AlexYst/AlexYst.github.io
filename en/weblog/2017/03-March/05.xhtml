	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I completed my reading assignment and <a href="/en/coursework/PHIL1404/#Unit6">learning journal entry</a> before going to bed last night, just after midnight.
		I&apos;d hoped to have it completed before then so I could go to bed sooner, but honestly, I didn&apos;t use my time as efficiently as I should have yesterday morning.
		Once I woke up, I packed my work uniform and headed to my mother&apos;s house to clean the bathroom, wash the dishes, and (I guess) provide company to my mother&apos;s cat for a bit.
		On the way to my mother&apos;s place, it snowed.
		Joy.
		I hate snow; it&apos;s cold and wet.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got to my mother&apos;s house, my mother&apos;s cat was excited.
		It might have been lonely or it might have missed me, but I suspect the former.
		Perhaps I&apos;m just projecting though; I have no strong ties to the cat.
		Honestly though, back when I lived there, the cat preferred my company over my mother&apos;s; my mother&apos;s too controlling, even towards the cat.
	</p>
	<p>
		The dishes were lower than they would have been had I still been living there.
		There was about a week and a half worth of cooking dishes, but almost no eating dishes due to my mother having switched to paper plates in my absence.
		I cleaned all of the dishes save for one plastic straw, which would need to be soaked in bleach.
		I didn&apos;t want to stay that long.
		I scrubbed the bathroom sink, counter, and toilet, all by hand.
		I accidentally dripped cleanser in the cat&apos;s water bowl, so I washed that out as well and gave it fresh water.
		I should have scrubbed the floor and the shower, but that will have to wait until another trip.
		Being in that house ...
		It makes me sluggish and very easily distracted.
		I had to get out of there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I got home, I started working on my <span title="Programming Fundamentals">CS 1101</span> coursework, but after setting up the page for the <a href="/en/coursework/CS1101/bool.py.xhtml">assignment</a> and having just updated the navigation menus and <a href="/en/coursework/">coursework index</a> to account for my new course registrations, I finally started a side project I&apos;ve been meaning to work on.
		Every time I need to add a course or assignment, I have to edit two different files.
		One is the coursework index and the other, among other things, controls the navigation menus.
		I have to search through both files and make sure to make the insertions in the right places.
		For now, it&apos;s not too bad, but making two edits instead of one wastes time.
		As my coursework list grows, it&apos;ll also take longer to find the right place to add the new entries.
		I&apos;m done with that now.
		I now have code set up so I can make a single insertion, and the scripts will take care of the rest for me.
		It took a couple hours to set up; programming always takes longer than I think it will.
		I completed it just before I had to head in to work though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I haven&apos;t updated my to-do list to account for recent events lately, so after work, I took care of that.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I forgot to register for courses yesterday, so I registered for them today.
		<span title="Programming 1">CS 1102</span> seems to be a course on Java.
		Ew, Java.
		I will need to know Java to develop mobile applications though, so this refresher course will be a good thing, even if unpleasant.
		In addition to <span title="Programming 1">CS 1102</span>, I also registered for <span title="Greek and Roman Civilization">HIST 1421</span> as planned.
		I almost couldn&apos;t find <span title="Greek and Roman Civilization">HIST 1421</span> in the list of available courses; the list seemed jumbled and disorganized.
		It turned out the courses were alphabetized by course name though, not course code.
		I&apos;ll have to keep that in mind for next registration period so I can more quickly locate the courses I need.
		I&apos;ve updated my course tree to reflect the new registrations, but there hasn&apos;t been any update to the courses I plan to take:
