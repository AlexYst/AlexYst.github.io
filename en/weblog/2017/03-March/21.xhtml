	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		My mobile plan ended today, so I started it back up.
		It seems all I had to do to fix everything was let it expire, then the option to turn it back on appeared.
		However, T-Mobile ignored the funds on my account and instead charged my card!
		If I didn&apos;t have other things to worry about at the moment, I&apos;d have a chat with T-Mobile support about it.
		They&apos;d better start using the existing funds on the account next month though.
		Otherwise, they&apos;re going to have a very angry customer to deal with.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I had a very strange dream last night.
		I was living in a house with two other people and we had a large, illuminated Little Caesars sign in our huge back yard near the back door.
		If I recall, our house and back yard were like the ones my family had when we lived on H Street.
		One of my housemates wanted to kill me.
		I&apos;m not sure exactly why, but I get the feeling it was because I care about the environment and they didn&apos;t want me to.
		So they tried to run me over with their car in the back yard.
		Somehow, I could levitate high enough to be out of the way of the car though, and there wasn&apos;t anything they could do about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think I dreamed that my carrots had gone rotten too, but my memory on that part is hazy.
		I just remember seeing that my carrots were no longer good, but my carrots are actually just fine.
