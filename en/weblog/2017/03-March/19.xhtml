		Marc With a C&apos;s nearly sold out of the vinyl editions of <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/the-real-live-sound-of-marc-with-a-c">The Real Live Sound Of Marc With a C</a> and <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/exactly-where-i-am">Exactly Where I Am</a>.
		They say they have no plans at this time to repress them, so if you like music on records the best, now&apos;s the time to act!
		I don&apos;t even have a record player (and yes, I know that&apos;s no excuse), so I instead bought digital additions of The Real Live Sound Of Marc With a C and <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/popular-music">Popular Music</a>.
		(I already had a digital copy of Exactly Where I Am.)

		T-Mobile support refuses to help.
		I thought T-Mobile was supposed to be the customer-friendly carrier!
		I won&apos;t pester them any further for now, though I think if they escalate my issue, <strong>*someone*</strong> at T-Mobile support could help.
		The stupid account has no way to pay by credit card <strong>*except*</strong> via autopay.
		I can&apos;t simply add funds to the account, T-Mobile won&apos;t let me.
		There&apos;s also no way to turn autopay back on from my end, and support refuses to turn it on for me.
		There&apos;s no time to go visit the T-Mobile store in person before the account dies, which will probably be at midnight tonight.
		I ended up buying a fund card at a department store near my workplace to add funds to the account.
		No $20 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> card was available, and buying two $10 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> cards would result in having to pay the idiotic E911 fee twice, so I bought a $30 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> card.
		Next month, I can add another ten dollars to make a full twenty.
		We&apos;ll see tomorrow if adding funds is all I needed to do to keep my Internet connection turned on.

		I&apos;d hoped to get a huge chunk of the reading assignment done, but admittedly, I allowed myself to get very distracted.
		I&apos;ll have to try harder tomorrow.
