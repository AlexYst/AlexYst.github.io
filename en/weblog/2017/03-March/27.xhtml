	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		The lanyard merchant sent me a <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> containing an image of the lanyars they planned to produce on my behalf, asking for approval before production.
		However, the image shows the lanyards will be totally blank!
		I ordered lanyards with text on them.
		If I wanted blank lanyards, I certainly wouldn&apos;t need them to be custom made.
		It&apos;s a good thing they asked before starting.
		Otherwise, I&apos;d demand my money back, and if they refused, file a charge dispute with the bank.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was going to begin my day by filling out a little paperwork, but I needed tape for my jury summons.
		They want me to fill it out, fold it, and tape the top, sending it without an envelope.
		I haven&apos;t had a use for tape at home though, so I never bought any.
		So, I headed to Fred Meyer to buy tape and take care of my Chase errand first.
	</p>
	<p>
		At Chase, the representative had no idea why Web support would ask me to come in-branch for help.
		They telephoned some line, provided their name and authorization code, then asked someone on the other end about the issue.
		The person on the other end didn&apos;t know what was going on, so the representative put me on the telephone.
		I explained the situation once more, and the telephone representative still couldn&apos;t see such a transaction.
		They then came to the realization that it was the fraud department that I needed to reach, so they transfered me there.
		After a long pause of <del>elevator</del> <ins>hold</ins> music, tasting through three songs, the fraud department came on the line.
		They asked me questions I didn&apos;t have answers to, such as how much I pay in loan payments every month.
		I have a couple outstanding loans from when I attended my old school, but I don&apos;t remember how much I pay every month.
		Every month since they canceled autopay on me, they send me an email telling me my payment is due tomorrow.
		Either that day or the next, I log in and make the payment for the default amount, the full amount due that month with no extra.
		I don&apos;t like my loan provider, and I don&apos;t spend time lingering there or looking at the numbers.
		I could tell you about how much I still owe, but not how much I pay each month.
		The fraud department representative was able to substitute the questions I couldn&apos;t answer with other questions, so it all worked out.
		Honestly, as you may have guessed, I suspected Chase was maliciously discriminating against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users with their &quot;security&quot; system.
		You may have guessed I thought that, but I didn&apos;t want to accuse them until I knew for sure.
		Thankfully, I was dead wrong.
		Instead, they don&apos;t allow foreign transactions by default.
		They located my attempted transaction, explained the issue, then removed the restriction on my account.
		Does that mean I can make any foreign transaction I like now, or only transactions with the <code>//st.</code> registry?
		One day, I might find out, but for now, <code>//y.st.</code> has its domain fees paid through <span title="Day 03652: Thursday, 2025 March 06">2025-03-06</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		While at Fred Meyer, I passed by their gift registry terminal.
		Much to my surprise and delight, is was displaying Xscreensaver.
		The terminal&apos;s running some flavor of Linux!
		Their bottle machines still rune Windows unfortunately, and I think their cash register computers do as well, but at least they&apos;ve got a Linux machine running in their store.
		It might be a sign that they&apos;re moving forward and away from Microsoft&apos;s noxious grasp.
		I mean, the bottle return machines are running Windows XP or Vista, I forget which.
		Those machines don&apos;t show what Fred Meyer is using on their newer machines, they just show that Fred Meyer isn&apos;t going through and systematically replacing Windows, or even upgrading their operating systems.
		They&apos;re artifacts of Fred Meyer&apos;s past.
		Perhaps newer machines bought by Fred Meyer are Linux-based.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other day, I received this website&apos;s first pull request.
		An update to this site&apos;s <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> had left an old journal entry broken due to a careless error on my part.
		In my defense, that update likely updated a few hundred pages, so it&apos;s not too surprising that I made a mistake on one of them.
		In any case, the pull request fixed the issue, but I wasn&apos;t able to process the pull request as easily as I should&apos;ve been.
		The journal entry was old, back from the time I put entire paragraphs on one line of code.
		The Gogs Web interface couldn&apos;t show me the difference the pull request would make, and I had to find a way to compare the two versions of the document by hand.
		After all, blindly trusting strangers without auditing their changes to my site would be a bad idea.
		Now though, I&apos;ve gone back and reformatted every old journal entry that needed reformatting.
		Every entry has only one sentence per line, which Gogs should be more than capable of dealing with.
		Checking future pull requests before accepting them should be quick and painless now.
	</p>
	<p>
		I filled out the jury summons form, which says I&apos;m ineligible for jury duty if I live outside Coos County, along with the change-of-address forms I&apos;ve been neglecting to complete.
		I was going to walk them over to the post office and enjoy the nice weather, but it started to rain before I left the complex.
		The elderly person that lives with the on-site property manager, who I just today learned is the parent of the manager, slowed down my departure a bit and had wanted to talk.
		Had they not, the rain would&apos;ve started on the way and I&apos;d&apos;ve likely gotten my forms wet!
		I ended up just depositing them in the on-property mailbox.
		Had the forms been less important, I&apos;d likely have just taken them another day when the weather was drier.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother visited me at work today, annoyed that I didn&apos;t answer their email.
		Strangely though, I <strong>*did*</strong> answer it before I left for work.
		Once I got home, I found no second email from them, so they must have somehow missed my reply.
		At the time though, I figured they&apos;d sent another email after I left for work.
		Of course I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve answered that, I was on the clock!
		My mother got weird about my hair clips, which they hadn&apos;t seen before.
		The fact is, I wear them only at work, where I&apos;m not allowed to wear non-company hats and where they&apos;ve failed to provide me a company hat, despite having promised to do so.
		With no hat, I need the clips to keep my hair out of my face.
		My mother&apos;s pretty stuck on traditional gender roles though, and as a male, they consider me to be masculine.
		Because of my mother&apos;s email before work, I anticipated that they might visit me on the clock, so I brought a gift I&apos;d been meaning to give them for a while.
		They had several bags of food for me supposedly, stuff they didn&apos;t want to eat themself and figured I&apos;d want.
		It wasn&apos;t even just vegan-specific stuff I&apos;d left behind, which if I recall, was only one pseudo-ice-cream bar.
		Instead, it was various other things that they just don&apos;t want, such as saltines, which I have been known to eat.
		However, they refused to give it to me at work, despite having it in their car.
		Instead, they insist on driving it to my place.
		It sounds like they&apos;re coming over tomorrow morning.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother wanted me to come on a trip to Portland with them, and was looking into my schedule to find when I could come.
		They were considering making it an overnight trip, and the premise was supposedly that they needed to visit Vivian in Gresham to do laundry at their place.
		I offered to do their laundry for them though, which took away the whole alleged point of the trip.
		They agreed that would be much faster.
		However, they later mentioned wanting to visit their mother in Portland, so I don&apos;t know if the trip has actually been canceled, and I&apos;ve already agreed to go.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother also got caught using my complex&apos;s dumpster, and admitted to knowing me personally.
		I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ll get in trouble for telling them they can use my complex&apos;s trash services or not.
	</p>
	<p>
		After my mother left, one of my coworkers quit on us.
		They&apos;ve been complaining of a rash for a while now, a rash thought to be induced by something in our workplace.
		They can&apos;t take it any more, and can&apos;t stand it long enough even to give two weeks notice.
		I&apos;m now covering one of their shifts, so I only have one day off this week.
		An overnight trip is a very bad idea at this point.
		I let my mother know of my singular day off once I got home.

	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
