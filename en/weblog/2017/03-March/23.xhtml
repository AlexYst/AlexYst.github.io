	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I managed to get through to the cable company today.
		I was going to ask about whether they would need my Social Security number to set up service, but it didn&apos;t even come to that.
		I first asked about their pricing and their contracts.
		It seems after they first year, when the service agreement expires, so does the price.
		They can potenially get me another deal after that, but the price will still go up.
		Furthermore, if I don&apos;t enter into <strong>*another*</strong> year-long service agreement, the price will go up even further.
		I wanted fast home Internet service so badly I allowed myself to get sucked into the cable company&apos;s awfulness.
		Thank Squiddy they&apos;re so awful I couldn&apos;t actually go through with anything.
		Wait ... maybe that&apos;s a <strong>*bad*</strong> thing; it means they&apos;re getting away with being an even more horrid than I&apos;d planned for, and they&apos;re still managing to get subscribers.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wasn&apos;t able to load the textbook today, but between tries, I decided to relax.
		With my schooling done (as much as I can get done, anyway) for now, I took a break and played Minetest for a bit.
		I even found a Nyan Cat!
		It reminded me of a mod I&apos;d wanted to make before, one that&apos;d allow the crafting of unbreaking tools out of the rarest nodes in the game.
		However, I didn&apos;t get around to actually programming it today; libtools is gone!
		Libtools is a mod I developed before to aid in the creation of tools with properties not normally found in tools of the game.
		Specifically, the tools can be placed as nodes!
		They even retain their tool wear.
		(Not that tool wear would be relevant to unbreaking tools.)
		I either misplaced libtools or I deleted it.
		Maybe I can find it in a backup of my laptop later.
		That said, maybe it doesn&apos;t even matter.
		With no <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> and home Internet connection, I can&apos;t host my own Minetest world anyway.
		There&apos;s no point in developing the mods I&apos;d want to use, as I can&apos;t actually use them.
		Someone else might find use for them on their own servers, I guess.
		For now, I&apos;ve taken up the name CobbleMiner and&apos;ve started playing in someone else&apos;s world.
		Speaking of mods, I also rebuilt my protection node mod from the ground up.
		The recipe for their creation is still tentative though.
		I want it to be costly enough that they&apos;re used with thought, but cheap enough that they actually get used when needed.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> claims I only paid my tuition for one course, but no the other!
		Both fees were covered by a single cashier&apos;s cheque though; it&apos;s impossible that they received payment for one but not the other.
		Early in the day, I wrote to the billing department about the issue, but they haven&apos;t written back yet.
		Tomorrow, I&apos;ll probably talk to my program advisor about it.
		The school says they&apos;ll drop me from next term&apos;s courses if I don&apos;t pay by the twenty-sixth, so if they haven&apos;t cleared this up by then, I&apos;m out of luck.
		There&apos;s not even time at this point to mail another cheque if I wanted to just pay the course fee a second time.
		It&apos;s never reach them in time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I spent the day trying to access the course textbook, but the site&apos;s been down all day.
		It&apos;s been down most of the week, even.
		I ended up having to turn in an incomplete submission for the assignment I needed it for, unfortunately.
