		Wow.
		I can&apos;t believe how uneventful today was.
		Aside from in regards to work on coursework for <span title="Programming Fundamentals">CS 1101</span>, which I discuss in my <a href="/en/coursework/CS1101/#Unit6">learning journal</a> instead of here, I honestly don&apos;t have much to say.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did stay after work for a bit after I clocked off to help mop the store.
		One of the shift leaders told me to clock off, but they didn&apos;t tell me to go away!
		The labor to profit ratio was kind of low today though, so I wanted to help balance that out a bit by working off the clock.
		It&apos;s not something I&apos;d do every day, but if I&apos;m in a certain type of mood, I do it.
		I used to sometimes work a bit before clocking on, too, though that wasn&apos;t really in an effort to help with the labor/profit ratio.
		I&apos;d show up at work early to cook in the large ovens, but there&apos;s nothing to do while waiting for my food to get done, so I&apos;d work while waiting.
		I don&apos;t seem to do that now, and I think it&apos;s because I can keep food at home now; I no longer <strong>*have*</strong> to eat my main meals at work.
		Oh well, it&apos;s not my responsibility to provide gratis labor, so they can just deal with actually having to wait &apos;til I&apos;m on the clock now.
