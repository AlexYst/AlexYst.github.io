	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I turned in my &quot;bingo&quot; card to the library for the raffle.
		It looks like they're giving away books to &quot;bingo&quot; participants at a party, but I won't be able to attend that party because I'll be at work.
		They said I could pick up my book at another time though, and gave me a couple email addresses with which to contact them and schedule a pickup.
	</p>
	<p>
		The clinic representative got back to me, and they said the Oregon Health Plan people fixed the postal address issue.
		Hopefully that's the end of this problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went to Fred Meyer to try on dresses, but I couldn't get even their largest dress to go over my broad, male shoulders.
		I'm starting to doubt the feasibility of my witch costume for Halloween.
		When I asked to get into the dressing room with the dresses, the attendant looked at me kind of funny, but did let me in.
		They probably don't get many males trying to try on dresses.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's still possible I might find a way to make the witch costume work, but the possibility of sundresses for casual wear is pretty much out the window.
		Thankfully with my split personality repaired, the desire for sundresses is gone.
		I mean, I could wear one, but I see no particular reason to.
		If anything, they'd be inconvenient due to my main mode of transportation: my bicycle.
		Shorts and a short-sleeve, button-up shirt are back to being my preferred dress code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got my rent paid today, a bit ahead of schedule.
		At least I didn't forget until the last minute like last month though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today was supposed to just be a day of running errands and washing laundry, but instead, I got called into work.
		I had yesterday off, but yesterday, a new, computerised system was put in place at work.
		Today, I got to try that out.
		Some aspects of our process now show marked improvement.
		For example, it used to be that our credit card readers were entirely separate from our registers.
		The buttons sometimes stuck on the card readers, so there was plenty of room for error.
		Not to mention that the separation was unprofessional and, quite frankly, ghetto like the rest of the store.
		Now, the card readers are connected to and synced with the registers.
		However, some things have just gotten stupid.
		We're required to put these stickers on all the pizza boxes, but the sticker system is redundant and confusing.
		We're also required to enter the pizzas we have custom-made into the computer, but the computer is limited and provides the incorrect price for unusual orders in some cases, over-charging the customer.
		And finally, one part of the new system is a bit creepy: we now clock in via fingerprint.
	</p>
	<p>
		The child of the franchise owner was there today working with us and helping us learn to use the new system.
		They helped me set up my account for clocking in, too.
		The system asked for my Social Security number, but of course I don't carry my Social Security card on me and I had no way to know I'd need to bring it in today.
		The franchise owner's child said I could leave that blank though, so I guess it wasn't needed anyway.
		So why did it ask for it?
		I also got to pick a user name.
		I chose <code>//y.st.</code>, but the system stripped the slashes and made it <code>y.st.</code>.
		It made me glad I went with only my domain name and not a full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.
		I'm honestly not sure what the user name is for though.
		We use our fingerprints to log in, not user names, and so far, the user name seems to serve no purpose.
		That said, this is only my first day working with the system, and it's very possible the user name will come up at some point.
		Strangely, &quot;first name&quot; and &quot;given name&quot; were seperate fields to be filled out when setting up the account.
		&quot;maiden name&quot; was likewise a field to be filled, not just &quot;last name&quot;.
		I'm not sure why they care about employees' maiden names, but I filled it out just the same.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
