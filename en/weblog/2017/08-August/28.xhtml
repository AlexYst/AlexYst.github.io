	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I looked into the two dating sites that&apos;d been recommended to me, but I&apos;m not sure either one is going to work out.
		The first one keeps redirecting me to the German domain, and won&apos;t let me stay on the <code>com</code> domain.
		I tried changing the <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> to <code>us</code>, but that didn&apos;t keep it from redirecting either.
		My guess is that it was performing a double redirect: <code>us</code> to <code>com</code>, then <code>com</code> to <code>de</code>.
		The second one claimed to be unable to confirm my location or my email address, and wouldn&apos;t allow me to proceed.
		I tried reloading the page in case something had gone wrong, and I was hit by a CloudFlare <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> wall.
		That&apos;s not happening; I&apos;m not going to register on a site that&apos;s going to be hitting me with CloudFlare <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> walls all the time.
		A bit later though, I tried reloading the page, and it worked.
		I guess that one doesn&apos;t like some exit nodes, but is fine with others.
		I&apos;ll tolerate that for now.
	</p>

		I was working on setting up the account when my neighbour knocked on the door.
		They were ready to give me the bed!
		After they helped me move it, they said it&apos;d never been used.
		Now I&apos;m confused.
		They were waiting until their new bed arrived to give me this one, but they weren&apos;t even using this one?
		I don&apos;t get it.
		In any case though, I now have a bed base and a box spring, so I can stash bins under my sleeping area and keep my mattress off the floor.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got back, the website had CloudFlared me again, but it was working fine in a few minutes.
		The site asked what languages I speak, and gave several options.
		C++ and LISP were offered, though no other computer languages.
		Too bad.
		After a while, the website logged me out and wouldn&apos;t let me log back in.
		I later came to realise that the stupid JavaScript, which is required for logging in, is often behind a <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> wall even when the rest of the site isn&apos;t.
		Something is seriously broken on that website, and I might not be able to work with it after all.
