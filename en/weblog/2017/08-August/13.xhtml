	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I awoke feeling much better than I had been yesterday, but I was still feeling down about the <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> scare.
		I cried a few more tears, continuing to mourn what I am.
		As I changed the tires on my bike (which was a lot harder than it should&apos;ve been), I couldn&apos;t help but play scene after scene of <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>-diagnosis aftermath in my head.
		I wept the whole time; it was almost like I <strong>*had*</strong> been handed an <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>-positive diagnosis.
		I&apos;m still a virgin though.
		And I&apos;m still drug-free.
		I&apos;m still clean; safe.
		As long as my virginity remains intact, I don&apos;t have to deal with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>.
		As long as I don&apos;t rush into anything with a boyfriend and I&apos;m careful enough about boyfriend selection, my risk of a boyfriend giving me <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> should be minimal.
		I mean, any time another person&apos;s involved, there will be some unknown variables.
		He could cheat on me.
		If he&apos;s good at being sneaky, I might not notice until it&apos;s too late.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two options ahead of me.
		First, I can become sexually active (when ready, which isn&apos;t now).
		If I do that, I risk getting <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>.
		If I get <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, I&apos;ll be obligated to become celibate from then on, to avoid spreading it.
		I think more than the inability to fight off disease, loneliness will be my curse.
		My second option is to remain celibate from the start.
		No <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, no obligatory solitude.
		That said, while my solitude won&apos;t be obligatory, it&apos;ll still be there.
		A self-imposed solitude will be protecting me from the potential of an obligatory solitude.
		Will I have really saved myself from anything?
	</p>
	<p>
		My back wheel seems a bit bent up.
		My guess is that the tire deflated not during the festival, but before, especially given the size of the hole I found in the inner tube.
		Riding with flat tires always seems to bend up my wheels.
		The bike&apos;s still ridable though.
		Some extra wear might happen on the back wheel, but it should be fine.
		I&apos;d considered trying to bike home on my flat tire, but opted against it, trying to avoid damage.
		It&apos;s a good thing I did, too, as too much more damage might&apos;ve put that wheel out of commission permanently.
		I&apos;m not sure where to get a replacement without replacing the whole bike, either.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went on a short walk to try to put myself back in balance.
		I guess it helped, and I felt better.
		On the way home, I felt a small impact on my head, and I figured a large insect had crashed into me mid-flight, but it&apos;d probably continued on.
		I took my hat off to examine it just in case the insect had stayed with me, and much to my surprise, I found a locust had landed on me.
		I swear, before moving to this complex, I hardly ever saw any locusts.
		Several years would go by without my even seeing a single one.
		This summer though, I&apos;ve seen three of them, and this last one came to me.
		I wonder if they like this part of the city better or something.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="library">
	<h2>Library task list</h2>
	<p>
		I finished reading The Wonderful Wizard of Oz today.
		It was a good read, though the end was a bit anti-climactic.
		I forgot to consult my critical books list before choosing it, so it wasn&apos;t exactly the wisest book to choose.
		It looks like my next book should be The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle, a book both in the public domain and that received an award.
		I can check off the requirement that I read a book that has won an award without reading something proprietary.
	</p>
	<p>
		The requirement that I read a book published in the last two calendar years still posed a problem though.
		I was having trouble locating such a book under a <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution">CC BY</abbr> or <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr> license.
		I thought it was a long shot, but I asked an online community centred around Creative Commons licensing if they had any suggestions.
		One user was fairly quick to respond, recommending I check out <a href="https://bookdash.org/">Book Dash</a> or <a href="http://africanstorybook.org/">African Storybook</a>.
		Book Dash was exactly what I needed!
		The books there are for small children, but they&apos;re all under <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution">CC BY</abbr>, and some of them have been published in the past couple years.
		They&apos;ve got <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr>s too, so there&apos;s no reason the library wouldn&apos;t count them.
		I chose <a href="urn:isbn:9781928377344">Mogou&apos;s Gift</a> (<a href="https://bookdash.org/mogaus-gift-lorato-trok-rofhiwa-mudau-shadrach-munene/">link</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to check out African Storybook as well, but their website is unusable with JavaScript disabled.
		Had I still been in need of a book, I would&apos;ve reluctantly enabled it to browse the website, but I already had the book I needed, so I didn&apos;t bother.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mogou&apos;s Gift was a very short and very strange story.
		A gifted child is born with a full set of teeth.
		One of his many gifts is great skill in painting at about six months of age.
		However, there&apos;s something freaky about his artwork: every painting he paints is of the same place.
		The child&apos;s mother decides they (the villagers) have to find the location being painted.
		There&apos;s no hint of where the place is, and no indication that it even exists.
		Eventually, the place is found, and it&apos;s identical to how Mogou&apos;s been painting it all along.
		They build a city there, altering the landscape so it no longer looks like the paintings, but everyone is happy there, so it&apos;s all good.
		When Mogou grows up, they make him their king.
		Um.
		What?
		For a child, it&apos;s probably a pretty good read.
		For a grown adult such as myself, it&apos;s pretty much one big plot hole though.
		Still, I&apos;m very thankful for this story; it&apos;s one less proprietary story that I need to put on my list of books I chose.
		At this rate, the only proprietary book will be the one meeting the library display requirement.
		The library chooses what to put on display, so I didn&apos;t really have any choice on that one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I read <a href="https://poetryfoundation.org/poems/53419/girlfriends">Girlfriends</a>, a poem my Elizabeth Woody.
		Proprietary: yes.
		Book: no.
		I can&apos;t say I really understand what the poem is about or what it means, but that&apos;s another item completed.
	</p>

<section id="mental">
	<h2>Mental health watch</h2>
	<p>
		I think I&apos;m still a loner.
		My body has certain cravings, but there&apos;s no strong desire for socialising.
		This may be residual damage to my psyche, but even if so, it might be permanent.
		If I&apos;m not the social type, it may not be wise to try to partner up, even without the <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> scare.
		If I&apos;m not the type to hold even a casual relationship, how can I expect to hold an intimate one?
		I&apos;ll continue monitoring this.
		Until I become more social though, I&apos;m abstaining from romance.
		It&apos;s the only wise move.
		I won&apos;t push it, either.
		I&apos;m not going to <strong>*try*</strong> to become more social.
		I won&apos;t try to be what I&apos;m not.
		I&apos;ve learned from last time.
		It&apos;ll either happen as the healing continues or it won&apos;t.
		I will try to put myself in social situations and see what comes naturally though.
		If I don&apos;t, there won&apos;t be any opportunity to see how I respond.
	</p>

<section id="jobhunt">
	<h2>Job hunt</h2>
	<p>
		I filled out most of an application for employment at Fred Meyer, but the website was demanding an emergency contact telephone number.
		I have ... no one.
		I&apos;m alone, with no support system.
		This isn&apos;t an unusual requirement, either.
		I&apos;m going to have the same problem when I apply elsewhere.
		I&apos;m not sure what to do.
		Maybe tomorrow, I&apos;ll work up the nerve to ask one of my neighbours if they&apos;ll be my emergency contact.
		I&apos;d do it tonight, but by the time I tried to apply, it was already pretty late.
