		I went and saw the eclipse today.
		It was worth seeing because eclipses are so rare, but needless to say, it wasn&apos;t very eventful.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that a college professor was hacking up their middle-aged college students and building an abomination out of them.
		The abomination was basically thefull body of the one student, with three other student heads coming out of their chest.
		One of these heads belonged to a student that had been some sort of werezombie; sometimes a zombie, sometimes not.
		The professor hadn&apos;t made them this way, but probably knew of the student&apos;s condition before hacking them up and stitching them to the rest.
		The werezombie was trying their best not to change and not to bite the rest of the abomination; biting it would&apos;ve killed all four of the people now sharing this body.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, it seemed the professor was choosing their victims based on an interest in cats.
		Is the student expressed an interest in cats in their submitted work, they&apos;d get the best grades of the course, but would later be used as parts for a body-splice creature.

	<h2>Library task list</h2>
	<p>
		I was going to check out Dracula to read, but at the last minute, decided to continue reading the Oz series.
		I checked out <a href="urn:isbn:0688054390">The Marvellous Land of Oz</a> and began reading it.
		I should&apos;ve completed it today, but instead mostly took the day off.
		The beginning of this book is pretty dark though.
		A child lives with this old witch, but doesn&apos;t like her.
		He plays a prank on her, and she decides to kill him in an elaborate way: turning him into a statue with a potion.
		The child seems to think the potion won&apos;t kill him, but only turn him into a <strong>*conscious*</strong> statue, but still unable to move.
		The potion is brewed, but has to cool overnight before use, so the witch goes to bed.
		In the mean time, the child runs away to save himself.
		Wow.
