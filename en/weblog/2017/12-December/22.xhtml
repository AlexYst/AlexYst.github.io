		I&apos;ve started to feel incredibly happy, with no obvious cause.
		I think it might be the removal of the infection in my teeth.
		The infection may have been dragging my moods down more than I would have thought it could.
		If that&apos;s the case though, I don&apos;t think the infection&apos;s been this bad for very long.
		In fact, I&apos;ve got to wonder how much of my recent negativity has actually been the fault of my toxic school after all.
		I had those three sick days, in which I felt terrible ... and I haven&apos;t been the same since.
		I thought they were induced by the school&apos;s censorship, and perhaps in part they were, but they were likely caused by an actual, biological factor: the infection in my jaw.
		I also thought that it might&apos;ve been caused by the poor diet I&apos;d had for a few weeks just before, but my poor diet was caused by a lack of energy with which to cook dinner.
		Again, maybe the infection was taking a lot out of me.
		Also, as my gayness slowly comes back, I could feel my self-loathing returning with it.
		It&apos;s gone now though.
		I&apos;m gay (homosexual) and gay (happy).
		(Not that my sexuality is back in full effect yet though.)
		I still realise I&apos;m a freak of nature, but I actually <strong>*want*</strong> to be a freak again.
		Freakdom is liberation; it&apos;s not the burden I&apos;ve been feeling it is.
		By the end of the night though, the newer surgery wound was itching pretty badly.
		Hopefully there isn&apos;t anything majorly wrong.
	</p>

		It seems my mother&apos;s likely going to be taking even more time from me, without even asking.
		She came by my workplace today asking when I&apos;d be getting off work tomorrow; she probably wants to grab me that day after work and leave town, which isn&apos;t what we agreed to.
		I&apos;ll need to hurry and get prepared before work, as I won&apos;t have the time after work I was counting on.
		A coworker tried to get me to cover their shift the next day.
		Honestly, I&apos;d love to get out of the holiday nonsense, because holidays are garbage, but that&apos;s not going to work out.

		My original plan was to use today to finish up the reading material in my other course and submit my second main discussion post, and do my grading tomorrow.
		That didn&apos;t work out as planned though.
		Instead, I did my grading today.
		I&apos;d better buckle down and get the discussion post submitted tomorrow though.
