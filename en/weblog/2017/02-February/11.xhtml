	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		It seems that two new Lifeline service providers have popped up in Oregon now.
		One is another <abbr title="code division multiple access">CDMA</abbr> provider.
		The other is another hybrid <abbr title="code division multiple access">CDMA</abbr>/<abbr title="Global System for Mobile Communications">GSM</abbr> provider.
		I&apos;ll probably wait until my current service is cut off, then apply with enTouch Wireless, the hybrid provider.
	</p>

		My mother gave me a brand new, supposedly scratch-proof frying pan.
		It comes with a lifetime warranty, too!
		We both know that it&apos;s not actually scratch-proof, but it&apos;s probably harder to scratch than most pans and it&apos;s got a non-stick surface.
		They also gave me a pair of insulated shopping bags!
		They thought that I might not want them though because &quot;I&apos;m funny about what I want and not&quot;.
		I don&apos;t want useless things, as they take up space and I have to store them and (when moving) transport them.
		Additionally, locked-down technology and nonfree media is worse than useless.
		I don&apos;t think that it&apos;s all that funny to not want useless space-wasters.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today at work, another person pulled past the menu board prematurely.
		As always, I politely asked that they wait at the menu board next time.
		However, they replied that there wouldn&apos;t be a next time, as this was the last time that they were getting pizza.
		That seemed a bit puzzling, but I continued ringing them up.
		As they left though, they said that maybe next time, I should have a better attitude.
		So to be clear, I asked them to wait at the menu board, they ignored me and pulled forward, then I asked that next time, they wait at the menu board.
		All of that, I did politely.
		They didn&apos;t want to follow the same rules as everyone else, and <strong>*I&apos;m*</strong> the one in need of an attitude change?
		No.
		If they&apos;re going to be needlessly obnoxious and try to blame me for their own inability to follow simple directions, I can&apos;t say that I&apos;ll be upset to not have them as a customer.
		Besides, in asking them to wait at the menu board, I&apos;m only doing as instructed by my head manager.
	</p>

		Today at work, I discovered that some of my music files don&apos;t seem to function in Replicant any more.
		I can&apos;t seem to find the cause of it, either.
		All of the files seem to be in one album, and that album plays just fine on my laptop.
		I tried some experimentation, and upgraded to Replicant 6.0 again to test the files there.
		However, I now can&apos;t access the developer options or <abbr title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</abbr> functionality in the upgraded system.
		I tried downgrading again, but now my mobile doesn&apos;t seem to work at all.
		This is getting seriously annoying.
