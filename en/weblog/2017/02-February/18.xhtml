	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I hate autopay.
		T-Mobile just charged me for another month of service when I was planning to let that tablet line die.
		However, I got too distracted by my busy life that I didn&apos;t keep track of the end date and get the line canceled in time.
		Additionally, they only charged me for the base service, not the stupid E911 fee.
		In other words, this fee is basically acting as a pay-your-bill-in-person fee!
		If I want to pay in cash, they charge me an extra dollar.
		If instead I let them just charge my card, they let me keep that dollar.
		I&apos;d say that that&apos;s a pretty underhanded tactic to get people to use autopay, but they don&apos;t actually tell you about that little detail.
		There&apos;s no incentive to choose one option over the other until you&apos;ve tried both, which most people probably won&apos;t do.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother&apos;s brain is frazzled, and as usual, they&apos;re blaming their lack of understanding of our agreement on me.
		They&apos;re not ready to move anything to my apartment today, supposedly because they didn&apos;t know when I&apos;d be available to move stuff, even though I told them on <a href="/en/weblog/2017/02-February/14.xhtml">2017-02-14</a>, a few days ago.
		They then continued that supposedly, I&apos;d told them that I&apos;d be available on the weekend, but I didn&apos;t tell them what time of day.
		I <strong>*did*</strong> tell them though.
		I told them that I have evening shifts, so I&apos;d need to do it in the morning.
		In any case, regardless of if they knew what time I&apos;d be available during the day, they pretty much admitted that I&apos;d said that I was available on the weekend.
		That means that they had no excuse not to prepare their stuff to be moved, as they did know what day they&apos;d need it ready.
		If they don&apos;t have their stuff ready today at all, time of day that we move it is completely irrelevant.
		As usual, their logic makes no sense and their memory outright sucks.
	</p>
	<p>
		As it turns out though, I gave them the wrong schedule the other day.
		I messed up too.
		I was still available this morning, though it&apos;s too late for that because they didn&apos;t get ready before today.
		However, I&apos;m available tomorrow in the <strong>*morning*</strong>, not in the evening.
		In theory, I&apos;m not available on Monday at all because I work an evening shift and my mother works in the mornings, but my mother has tomorrow off, so I can still help move stuff in the morning.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got sidetracked from coursework for a bit and worked on a short page on what to expect if you ask me for <a href="/en/a/help.xhtml">help</a>.
		I wanted to add more points, but I could only think of two off the top of my head.
		Sometimes people ask me for help though, then complain about the help that I give them.
		I&apos;ll expand it as I come up with more points to cover.
	</p>
	<p>
		I remembered what I was going to write about work yesterday.
		I really should write things down when they happen.
		In any case, one of my mother&apos;s best friends stopped through the drive-through.
		A bit later, my mother&apos;s stalker came through.
		I haven&apos;t seen their stalker for a few years, so I wasn&apos;t sure that it was them.
		Thankfully, they used their credit card to pay for their food, so I got a good look at their name.
		Sure enough, it was who I thought that it was.
		They didn&apos;t seem to recognize me, but then again, they might have just not reacted.
		After all, I&apos;d like to think that they didn&apos;t notice that I recognized them, either.
	</p>
	<p>
		After I got back from work, my mother gave me a small sculpture of a trio of three-legged frogs.
		They want me to put it by the back door of my apartment because of some superstition involving monetary gain.
		I&apos;m not superstitious though, not to mention that I don&apos;t have a back door.
		I guess that I&apos;ll bring it to my apartment when I get a chance, which will likely be tomorrow, but I&apos;m not sure what to actually do with it.
		Seeing as I know nothing about the copyright status of the work, its not something that I would actually want to display.

		In response to my <a href="/en/coursework/PHIL1404/#Unit2">learning journal</a> assignment submission from a couple weeks ago, my professor had this to say:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			What matters is whether the CD&apos;s contents are in the public domain and which legal and cultural norms prevail in which country.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		It sounds like my professor subscribes to the ethical theory of cultural relativity.
