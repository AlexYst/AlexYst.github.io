	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		When I stopped by my apartment today, I found that my laptop power cords had arrived in the mail.
		I haven&apos;t gotten a chance yet to try one out, but if they are as advertised, they should be the right cords.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother is throwing another one of their tantrums.
		Today, we started moving stuff to my place after I got home from work, and one of the things that we brought was four of the drawers of Cyrus&apos; old five-drawer dresser.
		I thought nothing of it; it was just something bulky that my mother wanted stored, right?
		Wrong.
		My mother had somehow assumed that I wanted the dresser, and took it upon themself to make sure that I got it without even asking me first.
		They started bringing the drawers into my bedroom.
		At this point, I assumed still that my mother wanted the dresser stored, but figured that I could make use of it in the mean time.
		Had that been the case, the logical place to take it of course would have been my bedroom.
		However, I have no plans to use a dresser.
		I&apos;m hanging most of my clothing up in the closet, and I&apos;ll find something much smaller and less space-consuming to store my socks and underwear in.
		It the moment, I&apos;m considering a small set of plastic drawers instead of a heavy, wooden, full-sized dresser.
		Anything that I own is going to need to be moved when I move out, and I don&apos;t plan to do any driving.
		I&apos;ll be moving on foot.
		I couldn&apos;t assert my assumptions though in case I was wrong, so I simply asked my mother to keep the stored items in the living room and study alcove only.
		Those rooms were currently empty, so it wasn&apos;t even like more storage space was needed yet.
		My mother explained that they were doing exactly as I thought, and that I could use it in the mean time.
		They asked if I&apos;d be using a dresser, so I explained that I was planning to use the closet instead.
		They seemed surprised, but that seemed to be the end of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		It wasn&apos;t the end of it though.
		My mother started freaking out once we got back to their house.
		They claimed that they didn&apos;t actually want the dresser stored at all, and had brought it just for my use.
		They were upset to have wasted most of the first load&apos;s space on those drawers that would now need to be brought back.
		they didn&apos;t ask me first though!
		Had they asked me if I even <strong>*wanted*</strong> Cyrus&apos; dresser, they could have saved the trip.
		They blamed me for it, but honestly, they&apos;re the one that assumed that they knew what I&apos;d want to use in my apartment and not.
		We loaded up a much smaller load in the car, then headed back to my place.
		There, the freak-out session continued.
		After unloading everything into my home and loading the drawers back into the car, my mother started hauling everything else back into the car too.
		What?
		As it turned out, they don&apos;t want to use my home as storage at all any more, simply because they made a faulty and ungrounded assumption and it had proven to be false.
		However, they left behind a chair that wouldn&apos;t fit in the car.
		I&apos;m confused though as to why we brought anything in this load though, if we were just going to haul it back to the car.
		Additionally, my mother didn&apos;t take back the drawers as we headed back from the first trip, instead waiting until the second trip to do so.
		I can only assume that they really <strong>*did*</strong> want the dresser stored as they had claimed the first time, and that the later admission that they didn&apos;t want it stored was the actual lie.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother is now saying that I&apos;m an idiot for wanting to use a closet instead of a dresser.
		the closet takes up space whether I use it or not though.
		I might as well use it to it&apos;s full capacity.
		I mean, maybe I shouldn&apos;t go out and try to buy enough clothing to fill it, but I certainly don&apos;t have a reason to start using a dresser when the closet&apos;s not even full.
		My mother also finally actually mentioned that they don&apos;t have a key to my home, something that Vanessa mentioned that our mother is frustrated about on <a href="/en/weblog/2017/02-February/07.xhtml">2017-02-07</a>, but that our mother has been too cowardly to actually confront me themself about.
		I explained that they had never asked for a key, but they don&apos;t think that that&apos;s a valid reason for not giving them one.
		My mother doesn&apos;t think that they should have to ask for a key to someone&apos;s home, that someone should just hand one over.
		They also claim that because I&apos;m a democrat, I have brain problems.
		Apparently, no one that doesn&apos;t have brain problems would be a democrat, according to my mother.
		More to the point though, I&apos;m not even a democrat!
		I&apos;m neither a democrat or a republican, because I think that both parties are evil.
		However, I registered as a democrat because only democrats and republicans can vote in the primary elections.
		Furthermore, I wanted to make sure to do what I could to get Sanders onto the main election ballot and into office.
		That didn&apos;t pan out, but then I voted for Clinton because Clinton was the lesser of two evils.
		And I do mean evils.
		Neither candidate that made it into the main running and actually stood a chance of winning was fit for office.
		I made two moves that a democrat would simply because the republican option was worse.
		However, that doesn&apos;t make me a democrat, and those are the only two actions that I&apos;ve <strong>*ever*</strong> taken as a democrat.
		My mother is also trying to weasel out of their wording on their blame on me for their carbon footprint.
		Blame is still blame though, so the wording matters little.
		They also say that they want me out.
		Completely.
		The main reason that I&apos;ve been staying is because they have my mobile <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card; my Internet connection.
		I need that connection for my <a href="/en/coursework/">coursework</a>.
		When I leave, I&apos;ll be taking that with me, which leaves my mother with no Internet connection because my mother was stupid enough to sign another two-year contract for overpriced service with a data limit and overages.
		Had they chosen a better carrier, they&apos;d have both a smaller bill <strong>*and*</strong> unlimited data use, but instead, I had to sacrifice my own mobile service to keep their Internet connection unlimited.
		They&apos;re the one that told me to get out though.
		Lastly, my mother says that they&apos;re not taking me with them when they move after all.
		Good.
		I don&apos;t want to leave here any time soon, but I was having a difficult time asserting this.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m moving the last of my stuff tonight, save for my laptop and my hotspot, as the hotspot is in my mother&apos;s bedroom.
		Unfortunately, it&apos;s raining, which is not going to be good for my mattress or my electronics.
		It&apos;s not like I have other options though; I can&apos;t just wait.
		It was raining last week too, and I don&apos;t have every day free to complete the move.
		It&apos;s today and tomorrow only.
		I&apos;ll report on my success in tomorrow&apos;s entry.
	</p>
