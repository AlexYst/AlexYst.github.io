	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I managed to get back into recovery mode.
		I gave up on trying to keep the files on my <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card though.
		I formatted the thing to see if Replicant 6.0&apos;s recovery mode would be able to read better with it formatted as <abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr>.
		It read the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card!
		This revealed two problems in the recovery system.
		First, the recovery system is failing to read Ext4 <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> cards even though the internal storage is formatted as Ext4.
		The recovery system for Replicant 4.2 0004 has no problem with Ext4 <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> cards.
		Second, the recovery system is calling failure to read the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card a failed installation.
		It makes it sound like the recovery system actually <strong>*tried*</strong> to install the system, when in reality, it failed to even <strong>*find*</strong> the system.
		A more clear error message would have been immensely helpful.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, the system was installed.
		However, it had problems.
		For one thing, <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card 0 was now corrupted and the device didsn&apos;t seem to be able to format it to fix it.
		Every time that it tried, it showed this error message as a toast:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			command &apos;13 9 volume partition disk: 179_0 public&apos; failed with &apos;400 15 Command failed&apos;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Without <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card 0 operational, the camera wasn&apos;t able to store photographs, as that&apos;s where it stashes newly-taken photographs until you move them.
		However, the device claimed that the internal storage (which is listed as a separate storage place) was working fine.
		I thought that <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card 0 <strong>*was*</strong> the internal storage though!
		In fact, when the real <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card was inserted, it becomes <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card 1.
		Additionally, the device kept thinking that it was charging when it was not, and the battery icon switched to the charging icon with the battery percentage outside the battery circle.
		Later though, the battery percentage would disappear from outside the battery icon, while the battery icon kept the charging indicator instead of the percentage.
		It was like the icon was in some hybrid form of part charging and part not charging.
		I could temporarily fix it by plugging the device into the charger for a little while, but it always reverted back to this broken state.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, I started messing with the crack in the battery.
		I&apos;m almost certain that this crack was here when the thing was shipped to me.
		My broken battery may be the cause of some of the problems, though I doubt that it has anything to do with the fact that Replicant 6.0 can&apos;t figure out how to fix the corrupted &quot;<abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card&quot;.
		I taped the battery together with masking tape, which seems to be helping with the inability to boot correctly, though it still takes a while to get the thing to understand that i want it to power on.
		I also reinstalled Replicant 4.2 0004, as it&apos;s known (by me, anyway) to be able to fix the corrupted &quot;<abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card&quot;.
		It can&apos;t recover the data or anything, but it can properly format it.
		I won&apos;t be upgrading to Replicant 6.0 again for a while.
	</p>
	<p>
		I need to remember that I can&apos;t replace my mobile with a Rockbox.
		<a href="https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/NoDo">Rockbox does not support non-<abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr> file systems!</a>
		If I end up deciding to give up on having a mobile because of all the problems that always seem to come up, I&apos;ll need a music player, but Rockbox won&apos;t fit the bill.
	</p>
	<p>
		After telling Google off, they actually allowed me back into my account today.
		Why do I have to yell at Google to get them to be reasonable?
		Not even that works most of the time though.
	</p>
	<p>
		The perfect opportunity came up at work today, so I told my head manager about the customer that wants to get me fired.
		Unfortunately, while they seemed to side with me in that the customer is a moron, they want me to allow the customer to do what they want.
		Ugh.
		The head manager is the one that even insists that I tell customers to wait at the menu board at all, but they now want me to give this customer special treatment by not making them wait like everyone else?
		That&apos;s how you train people to think that they&apos;re above the rules: you give them special treatment.
		Whatever.
		I feel a bit betrayed, but I&apos;ll get over it quickly.
	</p>
	<p>
		SafeLink has now actually told me what&apos;s going on.
		As I expected, they&apos;re discontinuing service in Oregon, but because they&apos;re one of seven or so intertwined child companies of a common parent, it&apos;s still possible to get service through them for a fee.
		They&apos;re discontinuing my service on April 01, a day known to some as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/April_Fools&apos;_Day">April Fools&apos; Day</a>, a day of practical jokes.
		Hilarious.
		I&apos;m sure that this wasn&apos;t the intention though.
		They sent me this letter via post though.
		Why?
		Email would have been both faster and less expensive.
