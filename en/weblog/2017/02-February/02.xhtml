	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I am very tired.
		My streak of days where I don&apos;t get enough sleep continues.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was supposed to take the paperwork that I completed two days ago back to the property manager&apos;s office today.
		That had been my plan, anyway.
		However, I was too tired to remember.
		By the time it crossed my mind, it was too close to time to go to work.
		I ended up taking the paperwork in and heading right to work without any real rest period in between.
		As I headed out though, I hit me: it&apos;s the beginning of the month.
		My rent is almost due!
		The second month is prorated to account for the fact that I paid for a full first month but didn&apos;t get that full first month.
		I forgot to check when I was doing laundry exactly how much I owe.
		I decided I&apos;d have to head home after work to check the prorated rental price in my paperwork, then head back to my mother&apos;s house, all after my closing shift.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way to work, I took a road that I&apos;ve never taken before.
		I quickly started worrying that I was going the wrong direction, despite the road that I was on being theoretically and mostly parallel to the street that I really should have been on.
		I guess that I tend to worry too much though, and the street lead exactly where I needed it to.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been eating a lot of junk food lately.
		I haven&apos;t wanted to admit it, but it&apos;s been affecting me in negative ways.
		Today at work, a coworker pointed out a problem that I can&apos;t ignore.
		I need to clean up my diet.
		Part of that means getting out of my mother&apos;s house so I can actually keep good food around.
		I need to look for a bed.
		That&apos;s going to be necessary before I can spend more of my time at home.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside the drive-through window, I spotted a strange, goldish coin.
		I made sure to be discrete and not draw any attention to it, as I didn&apos;t want a customer to spot it as well before I had a look at it.
		I assumed that it was likely one of those golden dollar coins that we have in my country but that don&apos;t show up very often.
		However, is was actually a novelty coin.
		On one side, it had the words &quot;HEADS I WIN&quot; and the nude upper body of a woman.
		On the other side, it had the words &quot;TAILS YOU LOSE&quot; and a nude butt, ostensibly the butt of the same person.
		I&apos;d have photographed it for my journal, but it didn&apos;t seem like appropriate imagery for some audiences, as many people get kind of weird about nudity.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got home, I checked the mailbox, and found that a bunch of junk mail senders had found out that there is a new resident in my apartment.
		Most of the mail was offers for things that I don&apos;t need or want, but a couple would have been useful if not for the stipulations.
		One offered high-speed Internet service for only $20 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per month.
		However, you have to sign a lock-in contract (so you can&apos;t cancel your service for two years) and the offer is only valid if you also buy telephone service.
		I don&apos;t want telephone service, and I&apos;m sure not signing any service lock-in contracts.
		Another offered money, but you have to start a checking account and savings account, sign up for direct deposit of your paychecks, and deposit $15000 of money that you already have.
		For one thing, I don&apos;t have that much money.
		For another, my employer doesn&apos;t offer the option of direct deposit.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way home, I started a game that I&apos;ve kind of wanted to start for a while now.
		I don&apos;t like motor vehicles.
		They burn fossil fuels and pollute my home planet.
		However, the registration plates attached to them sometimes amuse me.
		In particular, I like registration plates that spell words or have meaningful numbers.
		Vanity plates do not count, only randomized plates.
		For vanity plates to at all impress me, they have to be incredibly creative.
		For example, there&apos;s an image floating around the Internet of a Volkswagen bug that has a plate that reads &quot;FEATURE&quot;.
		That one&apos;s pretty sweet.
		Anyway, so my game is to photograph whatever plates hold words, important numbers, and abbreviations that aren&apos;t stupid.
		For example, I&apos;d take &quot;<abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>&quot;, but not something from <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>-speak, such as &quot;LOL&quot;.
		SO where do I draw the line?
		Wherever I&apos;d like.
		I&apos;m the only one playing this game, so I can choose whatever plates bring me this small joy and omit those that don&apos;t.
		I&apos;ll probably start uploading the registration plate photographs at some point, once I decide how I&apos;d like to display them.
		My registration plate for today has the word &quot;THE&quot;.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		Having mostly finished coursework for <span title="Programming Fundamentals">CS 1101</span> (aside from the reading), I moved on to <span title="Ethics and Social Responsibility">PHIL 1404</span>.
		The reading assignment for the week was this:

		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The <a href="/en/coursework/PHIL1404/#Unit2">learning journal</a> assignment asks that I focus on one case study, while the discussion assignment asks that I focus on another.
		I&apos;m not making the same mistake that I made last week.
		This time, I read the case studies before reading anything else, so I could construct my arguments as I read the rest.
		The first case study is summarized in my learning journal.
		The other case study is about the lottery.
		It&apos;s a short argument basically saying that the lottery is a poor tax.
		And it basically is.
		Well, it&apos;s more of a poor idiot tax.
		Next, I read the John Locke piece, as the learning journal assignment references not only the <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> case study, but also that page specifically.
		At first, it looked really short.
		However, when I next visited the page (which thankfully I did, as I was trying to double-check something), the page was much longer.
		It must have only partially loaded the first time.
