		<a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/">Marc With a C</a> announced that the proceeds from anything bought from their store today would be donated to the <a href="https://www.aclu.org./">American Civil Liberties Union</a>.
		Not only is Marc donating their proceeds, but Marc says that Bandcamp is donating <strong>*their*</strong> cut as well!
		I&apos;ve never heard of the American Civil Liberties Union, but it looks like they sued Trump over the racist executive orders that Trump signed, and continue to oppose Trump&apos;s racist actions.
		That makes them the good guys in my book, at least for now.
		I&apos;ll probably look further into what they do when time allows.
		I later learned that Bandcamp is donating their cut from all sales of anyone&apos;s music today, so it&apos;s not that Marc talked them into the donation as I had first thought.
		Instead, Marc is probably following Bandcamp&apos;s lead.
		That means that Bandcamp feels pretty strongly in favor of this group as well.

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I found wires sticking out of my laptop cord this morning.
		Joy.
		I really need to get this thing replaced.
		It&apos;s been broken for months, and it certainly isn&apos;t getting any better.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I headed out, it occurred to me that I had no time to wait to pay rent.
		It&apos;s not just that I need to pay now while I kind of have time, I need to pay now while the credit union is open.
		Rent is late past the fifth, which is a Sunday.
		This week seems like it&apos;ll be as busy as last week already.
	</p>
	<p>
		We had freezing rain early this morning after I went to bed or something.
		Many of the plants have small ice droplets dangling from their extremities.
		As I headed out, it began to rain again, though it didn&apos;t feel like freezing rain this time.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the credit union, I the teller asked me if I wanted a note put on my cashier&apos;s cheque.
		I provided a good-sided string for the note; it included my address, the month, and that this month was prorated.
		Specifically, I specified the date as &quot;2017 February&quot;.
		However, as the teller was writing that down, they first wrote &quot;2017&quot;, but then prepended it with &quot;2/&quot;.
		When they issued the cheque, the date in the note was &quot;Feb 2017&quot;.
		I&apos;m very particular about my date formats.
		The abbreviation is fine I suppose, as long as I&apos;m not the one that abbreviated it, but the year&apos;s got to come before the month.
		The common month-day-year format is all mixed up, with the mid-significant component followed by the least-significant component, then the most-significant component.
		Next time, I&apos;ll have to be sure to specify to make sure that it&apos;s labeled as &quot;2017 March&quot; and <strong>*not*</strong> &quot;March 2017&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
		I took the check home, then dropped it in the mail slot on the door of the on-site manager.
		There&apos;s a sign labeling that as the rental payment drop.
		Now that I think about it, their actual mail probably comes to one of the locked mailboxes outside.
		Once I got back to my mother&apos;s place, I received a notification that a package that I&apos;d been expecting had just been delivered by the post office to my front door.
		Really!?
		You couldn&apos;t have put it in the locked mailbox!?
		After getting ready for work, I headed home to secure the package so it wouldn&apos;t get stolen, then headed straight to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of my coworkers ask customers if they want a receipt when they sell them food.
		However, I always give the customer the receipt, as the till spits out receipts whether I want it to or not.
		If the customer doesn&apos;t take the receipt, what am <strong>*I*</strong> supposed to do with it?
		If the customer specifically refuses to take the receipt or they specify that they don&apos;t want one before I even try to give it to them, then I respect their wishes, but otherwise, they get a receipt.
		If they pay via credit card, the credit card machine <strong>*also*</strong> spits out a receipt.
		We have to keep that receipt, but the card machine then offers to spit out a second receipt for the customer.
		That is, unless the customer uses a card with a chip in it, in which case the card machine spits out a second receipt without asking.
		Of course, I give that receipt to the customer as well.
		Again, what else am I supposed to do with these receipts?
		In any case, I saw one of my coworkers ask the customer if they wanted the receipt today, and I saw the card in the chip reader.
		I commented, saying that the card machine was going to spit out a receipt either way, implying that there was no reason to ask the customer.
		However, it turns out that my coworker knows a trick that I didn&apos;t yet!
		When there&apos;s no chip, the card reader explicitly asks about a second receipt.
		But there&apos;s a way to cancel the second receipt even when it doesn&apos;t ask if you want it!
		This is going to save so much previously-wasted paper.
		Most customers just seem to crumple their receipts and toss them in their car anyway.
		They have no more use for the receipts than I do.
	</p>
	<p>
		My coworker that previously had pinkeye and had said that they might quit on the spot is still here.
		It seems that the place that they want to work at wants to hire them, but they need time to rearrange the schedules of current employees because my coworker has school and therefore can only work during certain times.
		This coworker also asked me what happened to my eye today.
		That scared me.
		Was I coming down with pinkeye too?
		As it turned out, they had just noticed the fact that one of my eyes opens further than the other.
		A bout of iritis did permanent damage to my eyes and vision several years ago, and since then, one of my eyes just doesn&apos;t open as widely as the other.
		Most people claim not to be able to see the difference, but if I look for it when I look in the mirror, it&apos;s always there.
		According to my coworker though, it becomes more pronounced when I smile widely.
		Strange.
		At least I&apos;m not coming down with pinkeye though.
		I don&apos;t have time for pinkeye.
