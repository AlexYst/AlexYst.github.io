	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Tonight after work, I stopped at the second-hand store next door to my workplace again.
		This time, they had the shower curtain rod I needed!
		They also had a small paper shredder, so I bought that as well.
		I tested it on a <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives">CC BY-ND</abbr> booklet that a certain organization sent me.
		They keep sending them, but I never read them or distribute them because of the license.
		The shredder works great, so I can use it on any similar booklets they send, as well as simple sensitive documents that I don&apos;t need any more.
	</p>

		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

		When I started my courses at University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>, I only released my essays once completed.
		This had the distinct advantage of allowing me to wait until I had a better grasp on what their content was before choosing a title, and thus, a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.
		I later started releasing my partly-completed essays, forcing me to title them before completing them.
		However, this had the advantage of making them visible in case one of my very few readers had any feedback.
		I&apos;ve come up with a hybrid solution now though.
		I obviously can&apos;t use a temporary <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, as then I&apos;d have to support that <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> from then on and it wouldn&apos;t be temporary so much as secondary.
		However, I can put my incomplete essays on my <a href="/en/coursework/PHIL1404/">learning journal</a> pages, as long as I don&apos;t use <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> fragments to identify them.
		I can do the same with partly-written discussion posts, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		The university got back to me, and they don&apos;t want my help in talking to prospective students if I don&apos;t allow them to put my photograph online.
		Lame.
		Whatever though, I&apos;ll leave that position to someone else.
		As there&apos;s probably an unlimited number of this position available, it&apos;s the school&apos;s loss, not mine.
