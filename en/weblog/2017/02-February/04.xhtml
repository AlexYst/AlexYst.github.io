	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I started the day working on coursework, which was mainly reading the assigned material and writing my interpretations and how they related to two specific pieces, but my mother wanted to talk politics again.
		Of course, I had to stay silent about my side because my mother would go off on me otherwise.
		It reminded me that I need to get out as soon as I can.
		I need my mother&apos;s leverage to go away so I can tell them to either stop bringing up politics or allow me to voice my side as much as they voice theirs.
		Either way would be fine, but for now, I can&apos;t tell them that so much.
		My task for today, I decided, was to clear off my old dresser.
		Most of it is paperwork that needs to be dealt with.
		Old letters, change-of-address forms, W-2 ...
		I started sorting things into three piles: those which I&apos;ll need very soon (W-2s, et cetera), things to that need to be filed once I have a good filing system at home, and things to burn.
		I mean that literally, too.
		The <abbr title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</abbr> keeps sending me propaganda booklets.
		I can&apos;t read or share them, because they&apos;re under the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives">CC BY-ND</abbr>.
		I can&apos;t recycle them, because someone might pull them from the recycling before they&apos;re processed, and might read them.
		My only choice, which it&apos;s taken me months to decide on, is to burn them.
		However, I quickly found that I needed a fourth pile, a pile to get rid of that didn&apos;t necessarily need to be burnt.
		Fearing that I&apos;d keep needing more and more piles, and seeing as I planned to take this stuff home after work tonight, I removed the burn pile and just had an urgent pile and a deal-with-later pile.
		More than anything, I just need this stuff brought back home and taken out of my mother&apos;s house.
		I did end up putting all non-paper items that I took with me to work in a third pile though, with each pile being kept separate in a bag.
	</p>
	<p>
		After clearing off the dresser, I remembered that my hands are tied.
		Today&apos;s Saturday; I work a closing shift tonight and an opening shift in the morning.
		I don&apos;t have time to go home after work, I need to get some sleep.
		At least I have this load packed up and ready to take home tomorrow after work.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was tired through most of work, and yet I was still in a better mood than I&apos;ve been in a while.
		Perhaps eating better has played into that, despite having been eating a lot of junk food even just a couple days ago.
		Though perhaps, it&apos;s something else.
	</p>
	<p>
		A child came through the drive-through with a couple of adults, ostensibly their parents.
		This is the second time that I&apos;ve seen this child.
		I remember because they glare at me for some reason.
		I think that they&apos;re trying to antagonize me, but I just find the experience amusing.
		If there wasn&apos;t glass between the child and I and if I had to deal with this child on a regular basis, I might have a different attitude, but as it is, the child&apos;s ill behavior isn&apos;t my problem or concern.
		Today, the child additionally curled their tongue and shook their head violently while they glared.
		Again, not my problem and a bit amusing to watch.
		I made sure to smile at the child, which probably had the effect of antagonizing them like they were trying to antagonize me.
