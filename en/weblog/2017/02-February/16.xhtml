	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Once I got home and checked the mail late last night, I found a coupon for a gratis <abbr title="light-emitting diode">LED</abbr> light bulb from the utility board.
		That&apos;s kind of neat.
		I mean, those are my favorite type of light bulbs, but the cost is probably worked into my bill somehow, so it&apos;s not actually gratis.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was foolish for me to consider not having to do laundry.
		I reduced the amount of clothing I dirtied by about half, but I usually have to run two loads.
		The only thing that would make sense is if I had only one load to do this time, which was exactly the case.
		Speaking of foolishness, I brought a part of my textbook with me on my mobile last night, but I forgot that I can&apos;t actually read it unless I have my laptop on me to take notes on.
		Due to the <a href="/en/coursework/CS1101/#Unit3">learning journal assignment</a>, I can&apos;t do it any other way.
		I didn&apos;t get any coursework done while washing laundry because I simply wasn&apos;t prepared.
		In my defense though, even if I had remembered, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to bring my laptop because of the rain.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was able to fit a full work week&apos;s worth of uniforms in my laptop bag, though not much else would fit.
		I managed to get enough underwear in to allow for one pair per day, but I only had room for one change of socks and no changes of non-work clothing.
		I&apos;ll be much happier once I&apos;m sleeping at home and I have access to my full wardrobe at all times.
		I&apos;d hoped that by the time that I finished washing laundry, I&apos;d have waited out the rain, but that didn&apos;t happen.
		The rain continued to pour as hard as ever.
		In fact, the rain was still coming down when I left for work this evening.
		I also considered just sleeping at my place instead of returning to my mother&apos;s.
		That way, I&apos;d be nearby and able to claim the gratis light bulb in the morning.
		However, I couldn&apos;t actually do that.
		For one thing, I didn&apos;t have my laptop on me.
		Assuming that I remember a dream, I&apos;d not be able to take note of it.
		Even if I had my laptop though, I&apos;ve got no Internet connection there.
		I wouldn&apos;t be able to sleep right away, so I would need to get started on my coursework.
		Finally, I don&apos;t have my mattress or any blankets over there yet.
		Getting to sleep would be difficult at best, and I probably wouldn&apos;t sleep well.
		Oh, well. I&apos;ll pick up that <abbr title="light-emitting diode">LED</abbr> light bulb eventually.
	</p>
	<p>
		Someone from Fred Meyer finally wrote back to me.
		They told me to make sure that I was entering the twelve-digit tracking card number or ten-digit alternate <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> correctly.
		The registration form wouldn&apos;t even let me register though, so I couldn&apos;t get to the page that allows you to add your card number or alternate <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		They also said that my email address might be in use with another account.
		Unlikely, seeing as I&apos;ve never used this domain for a Fred Meyer account email address and I tried several email address.
		Every time, the registration form silently failed.
		They also told me that my surname of <abbr title="Zone Improvement Plan">ZIP</abbr> code might not match the surname or <abbr title="Zone Improvement Plan">ZIP</abbr> code on the account, which would cause problems.
		Again, there is no account because the form won&apos;t let me create one.
		Clearly the representative has no idea what&apos;s going on.
		They told me to try another Web browser as well.
		If they&apos;re telling you to try another Web browser, you know that their website probably has browser-specific hacks barely holding it together.
		I tried though, and found that I&apos;m now banned from the website altogether, no matter which Web browser I&apos;m using.
		In the time that it took a Fred Meyer representative to respond, Fred Meyer decided to start maliciously discriminating against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users.
		Joy.
		Finally, they said to call some telephone number if I still need help.
		I responded, explaining all the problems listed above, and also said that I have no telephone service and cannot call any number.
		I&apos;m not dealing with obnoxious telephone support lines if it&apos;s not vital that I do so.

		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t remember much of my dream this morning, and what I do remember doesn&apos;t really fir together to form anything coherent.
		At one point, I was considering photographing some holograms of turtle-like creatures that walked upright on land.
		Despite being land creatures, they looked much more like turtles than tortoises.
		They were amazing to see, but I realized that they must be copyrighted, so I debated the ethics of photographing them for a while and decided not to, as they&apos;d make my photograph not completely free.
		At some later point, I was trying to traverse the ... amusement park, I guess, but I was not going about it in the way intended by whoever set up the park.
		The area with the turtle holograms was pretty flat, but I was at a muddy nature preserve area of the park now.
		Geese and platypuses were prevalent in the area.
		There were paths connecting the areas of the park, but I was trying to take a shortcut up a very muddy slope.
		I think that there was a waterfall coming down that hill too, but I don&apos;t recall for sure.
		I realized that I wasn&apos;t going to make it, and I came back down.
		After being down for a bit, I made a sudden turning movement as I prepared to go to the actual path, I accidentally tapped a platypus on the bill with my hand.
		Due to the reaction from the platypus (no reaction acknowledging that I even touched it whatsoever) and lack of pain from the impact in my hand, I assume that I didn&apos;t hurt it, but I still felt kind of bad about it.
		I turned kind of quickly though, and while I did try to stop my hand as soon as I realized that the platypus was there, it was too late to avoid touching the thing and I felt my hand make contact before I pulled back.
		I was kind of surprised that it didn&apos;t attack me just for touching it, as it&apos;s a wild animal, but now that I&apos;m awake, it makes sense.
		This was an amusement park full of people.
		The platypus would have been used to people by the time I ever saw it.
		Additionally, if it was vicious, the park managers would have had it removed for liability reasons.
		Not that dreams have to actually make sense though.
