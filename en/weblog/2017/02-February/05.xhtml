	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Soon after my mobile&apos;s alarm got me up for work, its battery dropped to one percent charge.
		It had been at over seventy percent when I went to bed and I had it in airplane mode!
		If the battery had died any sooner, I might not have gotten up on time at all, and been late to work.
		Scary.
		I didn&apos;t get enough sleep last night either, so there&apos;s a high probability that I would have overslept.
	</p>
	<p>
		It rained this morning, so I was reluctant to bring my files and other paperwork to work to take home after I clocked off.
		I knew that I needed to make this trip though, so I brought it and hoped for the best.
		Once I got to work, I tried to charge my mobile, but it refused to draw in any power until I shut the thing off.
		This thing must be on the fritz.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been instructed by the head manager to ask customer to wait at the menu board next time when they pull forward prematurely or don&apos;t even stop at the menu board to order.
		A customer pulled forward prematurely today, so I politely asked that they wait at the menu board until I rang in their order next time.
		They got pissed off, asking me why they needed to do that.
		I politely explained that if they pull forward too soon, the next customer starts talking in my ear and I&apos;m dealing with both customers at once, and it&apos;s a pain.
		They told me not to even worry about that.
		Seriously!?
		You&apos;re causing me extra difficulty for no good reason and telling me not to worry about it!?
		So I explained that I&apos;ve been instructed to tell customers to wait at the menu board.
		This really set them off.
		They said that every time that they come through the drive-through and I&apos;m at the window, the two of us have a problem.
		They canceled their order and told me that they were going to complain to my manager and see how much longer I&apos;ll be working here.
		They asked for my name and my manager&apos;s name, so I gave them the name that I&apos;m employed under, both the given name and surname, and said that there are several managers here.
		I then continued and gave them the head manager&apos;s name, both given and surname, saying that that was the head manager.
		I don&apos;t specifically remember this customer, but my best guess is that they always obstinately pull forward prematurely and get angry when I politely ask them to wait at the menu board next time.
		They don&apos;t want to follow the rules that everyone else has to follow, then get angry when I politely ask that they follow them next time.
		I told all four shift leaders that I saw today about the situation, as well as the assistant manager.
		I&apos;m not going to get fired, as I&apos;m only following the instructions that they head manager has given me.
		However, I do have to cover all of my bases just to be sure that I&apos;ve done all that I can.
		Regardless of my being upwards of ninety-nine percent sure that I won&apos;t get fired over this, it was still highly stressful, especially on top of everything else that&apos;s happened today.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I was headed out from work, I found that my home keys were missing.
		This morning, I had checked to be sure that my lanyard was in my backpack, but it turned out that they keys had come off because it&apos;s one of those lanyards that has a clip instead of a keyring!
		The keyring had come off of the lanyard and I hadn&apos;t even noticed.
		That cost me an hour, as I had to head back to my mother&apos;s place to retrieve the keys before heading home to deliver the paperwork and other stuff.
		Furthermore, it made pointless the fact that I risked the paperwork in the rain this morning.
		Ugh.
		As I was headed to my mother&apos;s place, I realized that I had forgotten things at work too: my food, my mobile, and my paycheck.
		That cost me ten minutes.
		When I got back to work, I found that one of my coworkers had unplugged my mobile and moved it to where they didn&apos;t have to hear it, but had not shut off the music that it was playing.
		Really!?
		Were they doing that just so that the battery would drain pointlessly?
		On most mobiles, or at least on every single mobile that I&apos;ve ever seen, the music can be turned off if it&apos;s playing from the lock screen.
		There&apos;s no need to even know the <abbr title="personal identification number">PIN</abbr>, password, or unlock pattern.
		There&apos;s no excuse for leaving it playing and just letting the battery drain.
		It&apos;s possible, at least on mine, to configure the device in such a way that you can&apos;t shut the music off from the lock screen.
		In that case, you actually would need to unlock the device to get it to stop playing.
		I, however, did not do that.
		In fact, I configured it to have an even better control set on the lock screen.
		Not only can you turn off the music, you can turn it <strong>*on*</strong>.
		You can also toggle shuffle mode and/or set the player to play one song in a loop, all songs of the current queue in a loop, or stop when it gets to the end of the queue.
		You cannot change what&apos;s <strong>*in*</strong> the queue, but the point is that you can still shut off the player, which is a standard feature that mobile users should know about.
		And the reason that they unplugged and moved mine out of earshot was to set up their own, so they are a mobile user and should know about the basic and easy-to-use ability to shut off the music without unlocking the device.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way back to my mother&apos;s place, I dropped my plastic container of prepared potatoes.
		The lid popped off and about half of them went flying to the ground.
		With how bad today went, I&apos;m probably lucky that the container even landed upright and that I got to keep <strong>*any*</strong> of the potatoes.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I neared home, I saw a medic unit just outside my apartment complex.
		It was dark and the vehicle has flashing lights, so I thought that it was a fire truck and that there might have been a fire at my apartment.
		Once I got even closer, I saw an actual fire truck outside the apartment.
		Joy, I thought, the apartment complex has suffered fire damage and I&apos;ve probably lost some irreplaceable belongings.
		That hadn&apos;t happened though, and I don&apos;t know what these emergency vehicles were doing at the complex.
		One of my neighbors had their door wide open though, so it&apos;s possible that they were badly injured and had to be hauled to the hospital.
		I really hope that nothing as serious as that happened though, and that the paramedics were barely needed.
		While at the complex, I also checked in at the gratis item table and found a couple of garments.
		One is a robe that has some kind of gunk on it.
		The other is a shirt, that I&apos;ll probably wash as well before wearing just in case.
		These two garments are probably the only positive thing that&apos;s happened to me today.
	</p>
	<p>
		Google&apos;s being nasty again.
		They once more locked up my Google Voice account.
		They demanded that I add either a &quot;security&quot; email address or &quot;security&quot; telephone number.
		Last time that they did this, I tried using one of those disposable email addresses.
		They then did a manual review of my account, and decided to keep me locked out while refusing to tell me why.
		This time, I created a bogus email account that I&apos;ll never use with an actual email service provider.
		So, I can waste room on their server with an account that I don&apos;t even use.
		My logic here was that when they reviewed my account, maybe they&apos;d be less bitchy.
		However, they didn&apos;t even run a review, they just required that I add this vulnerability to my account.
		Joy.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother and I took my mother&apos;s laundry to my apartment via car today.
		I said that I&apos;d wash their laundry for them, but they insist that they be there for it for some stupid reason.
		They then asked when I&apos;d be doing my laundry, so I explained that I&apos;d be doing it Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning.
		I&apos;ve taken to washing my laundry on Tuesday mornings since renting the apartment, though there&apos;s a chance that I won&apos;t get to it until the next morning.
		They explained that they can&apos;t be there for that, which is fine, and asked what evenings I&apos;d be able to be there.
		Again, that would be Tuesday and Wednesday, my days off from work.
		Now they&apos;re going to have me be there to do laundry with them on Tuesday evening.
		If I don&apos;t have my coursework done by then, that&apos;ll be a chance for me to work on that, just like when I wash my own laundry that morning.
		However, I think that they now think that they&apos;ve rescheduled when I&apos;m doing <strong>*my*</strong> laundry.
		If so, that&apos;s just plain idiotic.
		There&apos;s no reason why their demanding that they be there when I wash their laundry would mean that doing my own laundry gets rescheduled.
		Furthermore, there&apos;s only three washing machines and they each only take half a load.
		I&apos;ll need two of them myself, and I don&apos;t know how many half loads <strong>*they*</strong> have.
		We can&apos;t do it all at once even if I was willing to go along with the rescheduling.
		They also asked me if I needed them to drive any of my laundry over, to which I of course replied that I didn&apos;t.
		I don&apos;t need them to burn fossil fuels to haul my laundry that I&apos;m more than capable of hauling on foot.
		They then said that they themself had lots of laundry to do, and made it seem like they thought that I must not have any laundry to do at all.
		I had already told them <strong>*when*</strong> I was doing laundry.
		How could I <strong>*not have laundry to do*</strong>?
		Foolishness.
		Anyway, if they&apos;d just allow me to do their laundry without their presence, it&apos;d save me a little time and save them a lot of time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I planned to get a chunk of coursework done, but after this stressful day, I instead just tried to relax.
		I&apos;ll get some stuff done tomorrow.
	</p>

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that some jerk wouldn&apos;t stop using scissors to try to cut a pair of my pants - while I was still in them!
		I kept telling them off, but they wouldn&apos;t knock it off.
		They kept getting my leg, and it hurt!
		After that, a third party eventually got involved and tried to resolve the situation, but made it out like I was the one in the wrong for yelling.
		After that, it turned out that the thirt party was a comic artist, but I woke up too soon to learn how that would become relevant to the dream.
