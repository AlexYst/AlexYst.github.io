		I needed something to go right this week, so I bought some new music.
		I&apos;ve now subscribed to <a href="https://kubbi.bandcamp.com/subscribe">Kubbi</a>&apos;s ... I&apos;m not sure what to call it.
		Channel, I guess?
		Music station?
		In any case, for three dollars per month, I now get access to Kubbi&apos;s works, most of which are released under the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported">CC BY-SA 3.0</abbr> license.
		Two and a half albums have no license at all, but I&apos;ve hidden those from my visible collection and not downloaded them.
		As for the rest of their music, it&apos;s pretty awesome!
		The <a href="https://kubbi.bandcamp.com/album/ember">Ember</a> album alone is worth the subscription.
		I can&apos;t wait until I have time to sit down and actually listen to each album individually and experience what each has to offer.

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		On Friday, I made plans to head home today, bringing a load with me and picking up work close for today while I was there, and check in with a second-hand mobile shop to see if they had any batteries for my device.
		Speaking with my mother yesterday made me forget about the battery though.
		As a result, I ended up making the trip home yesterday, instead of today, and forgetting about the mobile shop, which was probably closed yesterday.
		I debated back and forth about making another trip today.
		If I went, I&apos;d be another step closer to being moved out of my mother&apos;s house.
		If I didn&apos;t go, I could use the time to work on coursework, which I&apos;m behind on this week.
		I could take a light load, such as my computer monitor, or I could take a heavy load, such as a large bin of clothing.
		As such, I couldn&apos;t really justify not going on the grounds of being too tired to carry the final heavy bin.
		That line of reasoning only served to make sure that I did make the trip though.
		Once that decision was made, I had no way to actually justify not taking the heavy load to be done with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t know if this bin was actually lighter or if I&apos;m just getting stronger from all the carrying, but this bin felt much lighter than the others.
		Additionally, with the exception of my mattress, it&apos;s the last heavy thing to bring over.
		I mean, I could have made these bins light by emptying then and carrying the clothing in more smaller trips, but that seemed like a waste of time.
		The remainder of my non-mattress belongings are small in number though, so once I have them packed, there should be one small box, plus the bulky items.
		These bulky items include things such as my server and monitor, each of which isn&apos;t heavy, but cannot be brought with other stuff due to the size (and in the case of the monitor, shape) of the items and must each be brought individually.
		I&apos;m getting close.
	</p>
	<p>
		As expected, the mobile shop wasn&apos;t able to help.
		They don&apos;t stock batteries and they don&apos;t have any Galaxy SII devices in stock.
		Those devices are so old that it&apos;s likely that no one has them in stock, save for highly-specialized shops and shops that have a better way to stock more items at once (such as an online shop).
		I did what I told someone that I&apos;d do though, which is check.
		That&apos;s was why this trip couldn&apos;t be put off, more than any other reason.
		I said that I&apos;d check on Monday, which is today.
		Next, I said that I&apos;d get in touch with <a href="https://tehnoetic.com/">Tehnoetic</a>&apos;s owner and ask if they&apos;d be able to sell me a battery.
		I&apos;m nervous about that one though, not to mention that I&apos;m pressed for time right now, and I didn&apos;t specify a time frame on it.
		I&apos;ll do that later.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried using the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files of that problematic album directly on my mobile instead of converting them to Vorbis files like last time, and found that that didn&apos;t even fully fix the problem.
		All four of the &quot;bad&quot; tracks, in <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> form, show up on the device as being zero-length.
		That makes them easier to spot than they are on the Vorbis version of the album.
		However, aside from the final track, they&apos;re playable.
		Three of the &quot;zero-length&quot; songs actually play as they should!
		Next, I reluctantly tried the <abbr title="MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> version of the songs.
		Strangely, these actually all play correctly.
		It&apos;s not a fix, but it&apos;s a way to keep my playlist usable for now.

		A short part of what I read today talked about an ethical framework that&apos;s about maximizing human flourishing.
		I think that this is the framework that best fits that which motivates me.
		There are some exceptions I think, such as that I don&apos;t think that deception is a valid way to increase said flourishing, but for the most part, that which helps our species do better is that which I feel is a good action.
		Of course, that does not mean that I think that this is the objectively-correct ethical framework to use, or that I even think that an objectively-correct scale to use exists, only that this is the scale that I personally see the most value in.
