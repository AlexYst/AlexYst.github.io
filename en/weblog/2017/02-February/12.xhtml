	<p>
		I forgot to perform a factory reset after downgrading my device last night.
		Now that I&apos;ve done that, the device actually boots into a usable system instead of getting stuck at the boot screen.
		That one album still won&apos;t play though.
		I&apos;ve given up on trying to debug.
		I don&apos;t have the time or emotional energy left to keep trying.
		Instead, I reached into my archive and pulled out the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> version of the album.
		I try to keep lossless files in storage in case I ever need them for something, though a malfunctioning mobile was never what I expected.
		However, running <code>find . -name &quot;*flac&quot; -exec oggenc {} \;</code> in the directory of extracted lossless files resulted in a Vorbis-formatted album that would hopefully actually function in the mobile.
		But did it?
		No!
		This has me even more convinced that the problem is in the mobile itself.
		My best guess is that something in the album&apos;s meta data is triggering the issue though.
		Otherwise, I&apos;m not sure why particular songs in only this album are affected, while I haven&apos;t noticed any issues whatsoever in other songs in the same album or in songs of other albums.
		I tested the original Vorbis files (not the ones that I constructed from the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files) in another mobile too, and they work perfectly there.
		Again, as I said yesterday, the original Vorbis files also work on my laptop.
		The issue seems to be specific to this Replicant device.
		I can&apos;t do any more debugging right now though, I just can&apos;t take it.
		Speaking of this mobile, the default camera application is now accessible from the lock screen.
		If you recall from a previous entry, the system was not recognizing the default camera application as being a camera application, and as a result, wasn&apos;t allowing access to it from the lock screen.
		The version of the system running now is the exact same version that was running when I made that observation and the same version of the system that it was running throughout the period in which I was trying to fix the settings, as I thought at the time that it was a settings issue.
		Nothing should be different this time, but the music player is misbehaving and the camera application has stopped misbehaving.
		I&apos;m very confused.
	</p>
	<p>
		My laptop&apos;s power cord is doing worse.
		I was supposed to replace it as soon as we moved, but instead of us moving, <strong>*I&apos;m*</strong> moving.
		I realized that I should have ordered a new cord online fairly quickly, but instead, I tried to draw it out and make this one last.
		Bad idea.
		I need this machine to complete my coursework.
		I got a scare early this morning when I found the cord not charging the laptop, and that&apos;s gotten me to get a move on.
		I&apos;ve ordered two laptop cords.
		The first, I&apos;ll use to replace this cord.
		The other, I&apos;ll keep as an unused spare for when the new one starts having problems.
		When that happens, I&apos;ll order a new cord.
		I&apos;ll try to keep an unused spare at all times to be safe.
	</p>
	<p>
		Someone telephoned me and left a garbled message.
		I don&apos;t know what they were trying to say.
		However, in retrieving that message, I had to telephone the voice mail system and set up my voice mail account.
		That used up some of my minutes, which means that it probably counts as my telephone call for the month.
		I don&apos;t have to make another until next month.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother went on an outing and tried to get me to come with them.
		The went about it horridly though.
		They asked what my plans were, so I told them.
		I needed to go home today to get a clean work uniform for tomorrow, and I also have coursework that I need to get done.
		They said that if I wanted, I could go with them and they&apos;d take me home to pick up the uniform on the way back.
		They know though that I try to avoid running my errands by motor vehicle though.
		And I can&apos;t be straight with them about it either.
		Last time, they freaked out and started projecting.
		I would have happily come with to keep them company and put off my own errand for a bit, but I couldn&apos;t roll my errand into their trip.
		But because I couldn&apos;t tell them that without causing them to freak out, I had to turn down the whole trip.
		With each trip home though, I bring a bit more of my stuff.
		Hopefully soon, I&apos;ll be fully moved in.
		I have more clothing than I&apos;d realized.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once more, the Oregon Health Plan people have written to me, sending me a vague email telling me that I have a message on their website to read after logging in.
		As usual, there&apos;s no actual message visible after logging in.
		Again, it seems that my application is no longer filled out as well.
		I&apos;m too tired to try filling it out again.
		I have too little energy and time right now.
