	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I spent large chunks of the day finding mineral-defining mods for Minetest and testing them with <code>minestats</code>.
		I found a corner case in need of dealing with, and I think I might&apos;ve found another problem, but I don&apos;t recall.
		I fixed the one issue, and if there was a second issue, I fixed that as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Discover wrote back, saying they&apos;d be fine accepting copies of my documents by post instead of the originals.
		Okay ... that&apos;s not the response I was expecting.
		I already offered to do that though, if they&apos;d allow it.
		Alright, I&apos;ll play nice and mail copies, as long as I can keep the originals.
	</p>
	<p>
		The on-site manager&apos;s parent brought me canned goods!
		Someone left them in the laundry room, and apparently people have been throwing out the gifts people leave there lately before other people have a chance to claim them.
		Seeing them and not wanting them to get wasted, the manager&apos;s mother brought them to me.
		They also offered to bring me to this food-giving place on Friday; we&apos;ll leave somewhere from 09:00 to 10:00.
		I&apos;m not sure where it is, but apparently they give away food on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.
		I&apos;ve been asked to bring my rent receipt as proof of address, and will also bring my <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> as added proof of address.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t want to pry myself away from my computer again, but I wrote to my mother to ask if I could come over to visit.
		They confirmed, so I went to see them.
		They mostly wanted to watch videos on their computer though, so I was left wondering why I even came.
		While I was there though, they offered me a huge jar of pickles, some green tea, a fancy screwdriver, and some shoes.
		I had to decline the shoes as they were made of leather though.
		Tomorrow, I was going to try to visit again, but my mother will be out of town, so I can stay home or go somewhere else.
	</p>
	<p>
		The more I&apos;ve thought about it, the less I&apos;ve wanted my mother to call me by my legal name.
		I&apos;ve thought about it quite a bit over the past month, too.
		My mother has rejected every name I&apos;ve chosen to go by over the years, which is four names that weren&apos;t on my birth certificate, including my legal name.
		The first non-birth name I asked to be called was my middle name, and they agreed to call me that.
		They then promptly refused to do as they&apos;d agreed to do until long after I&apos;d chosen a different name.
		At that point, they started calling me by my middle birth name, but I didn&apos;t want that any more.
		In any case, they&apos;ve always rejected what I choose to go by, and the name &quot;Alex Yst&quot; is no different.
		I&apos;ve changed it in court now, but that doesn&apos;t change how real the name is; it only allows me to prove my name.
		I thought my mother would be inconsistent though and try to call me &quot;Alex&quot; now.
		I thought they&apos;d either do it to try to backtrack and claim they&apos;re fine with me going by an alternate name or that they&apos;d falsely think that this court action somehow makes this name different as far as they&apos;re concerned; it doesn&apos;t.
		It turns out I had nothing to fear though.
		My mother is still stubbornly calling me by my birth name, so as long as I don&apos;t bring it up, I have what I want from them.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Legal matters</h2>
	<p>
		I put off heading to the Lane County Courthou&apos; for quite a while.
		I&apos;d spent the day having fun, and didn&apos;t want to cut that fun short.
		There came a point though when I feared I wouldn&apos;t make it to the courthouse before they closed though.
		I still had several hours, but I figured I&apos;d better head in.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve begun remembering difficulties in the route to the courthouse, and realising how to bypass them.
		I&apos;d say I&apos;ve been taking too many trips there, but this is only the third trip.
		There&apos;s a road I&apos;m supposedly supposed to cross though, a very busy road that crosses a bridge.
		I&apos;m to cross the street, then take a road that leads under the bridge.
		Why?
		I can just stay on the side I&apos;m already on, not cross the busy road, and end up right where I was going to be anyway.
		The directions I looked up weren&apos;t the most efficient, clearly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once past the metal detectors at the courthouse, I went to the postings binder to pick up my posting.
		My surname starts with wye, so as the binder has separators to keep the binder in mostly-alphabetical order, I put my posting near the back, in the ex wye zed section.
		Now, I had to retrieve it, but someone had royally messed up the contents of the binder.
		Pages were everywhere, and most weren&apos;t attacked to all three rings of the binder any more.
		With my posting near the back, I had two options.
		I could either reorganise the binder, page by page, until I got to my listing; or I could ruffle the pages more, damaging them, and get to my posting that way.
		Obviously,I chose the former route.
		It took longer, but I don&apos;t have to feel bad about damaging other people&apos;s paperwork.
		There were only a couple listings after my own, so I neatly fixed their attachment in the binder as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		The judge had ordered that I leave the posting in a public place for at least fourteen days.
		Out of paranoia, I waited fifteen.
		The other judge had ordered that I post notice of my hearing for fourteen days, but actually had waited fifteen days to schedule to hearing, so what made the second posting, the posting of the court&apos;s decision, any different?
		If I was right, I&apos;d save a trip to the courthouse.
		If I was wrong, I&apos;d delay the finalisation by one day.
		Not a big deal.
		It turns out my intuition was right.
	</p>
	<p>
		The court clerk that I brought my notice and final paperwork to said I had to wait one more day still.
		What!?
		But I already waited longer than the judge had ordered me to!
		I explained that I&apos;d already waited the fifteen days the clerk said I needed to, but they disagreed until going over a calendar.
		It turns out they&apos;d lost a day and thought that today was Tuesday, not Wednesday.
		Everything was in order, except they made me white out the spot on the final paperwork in which I said I&apos;d waited at least fourteen days, and replace it with notice that I&apos;d waited at least fifteen days.
		Whatever, as long as it goes through.
		They asked to see my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> before I signed, so I presented my current <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		I&apos;d feared I might need to act under my old name for this final document, but they seemed fine with my new <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, so I signed under my current legal name.
		Everything&apos;s been finalised!
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way back, I found a distraction, and headed down an alternate route to get a better look.
		I got lost, but found my way back to a main road without backtracking.
		Where I ended up surprised me.
		I was on D Street!
		My original directions sent me from home to go down D Street, and supposedly, there was a path to Eugene down that way after several turns.
		I think I found it!
		It&apos;s off in some cul-de-sac in the neighbourhood of the area.
		I had almost no chance of finding it from the side closer to home unless I knew the area already.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		The school has updated my name in their records!
		The update shows up in the student portal, but they must have redundancies in their database; and I don&apos;t mean a redundant database.
		My name is still incorrect in the classroom, which means I&apos;ll potentially be having to interact with other students under the wrong name still.
		I wrote back to my advisor about the issue, who&apos;d alerted me to the update to begin with.
		They said to wait forty-eight hours, and if it wasn&apos;t updated by then, to write back.
