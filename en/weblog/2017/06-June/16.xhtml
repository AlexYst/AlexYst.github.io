	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been soaking that &quot;non-stick&quot; frying pan from my mother in soapy water for a couple days.
		Some gunk still won&apos;t come off.
		Some non-stick pan that is.
		It seems ceramic is just no substitute for polytetrafluoroethylene.
	</p>
	<p>
		I needed a break from my studies, so I worked on <code>minestats</code> a bit.
		I&apos;ve merged the two page sets to form one set of stats pages.
		Farming stats and mining stats are now treated almost equally!
		The main exception is that the farming stats are displayed first in the stats list; the farming and mining stats aren&apos;t randomly mixed together.
		This is because I have everything sorted.
		While the farming stats display an example node beside them, they technically don&apos;t have a specific node associated with them as far as stat increases are concerned.
		I have everything sorted by node first, then drop, and I consider <code>nil</code> to come before any actual strings when sorting.
		The other thing I&apos;ve finished today is the moving of the stats page code to a separate file from the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>.
		What this does is force the stats page code to use the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> from the outside, not the inside, preventing it from getting any special treatment or access to parts of the code other mods don&apos;t have.
		The stats page could now become a separate mod, and I considered making it one, but I opted against that.
		The stats menu can be disabled from another mod though, and re-implemented.
		This means that if someone wants to try porting the stats menu to <code>unified_inventory</code> for example, they can do that.
	</p>
	<p>
		After work, I found a letter from Chase Bank in the mailbox.
		It claims they reviewed my account and found the name change had already taken place; there was nothing for them to do.
		I&apos;m having trouble logging into their website to verify the change, as their website is incredibly wonkey, but I find it incredibly unlikely given the wording of the letter that they actually updated my account.
		Most likely, they saw the authorised user card.
		I&apos;m hoping for the best though.
