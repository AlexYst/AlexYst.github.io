	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I went to visit my mother today, but we didn&apos;t really do anything.
		My mother just watched a <abbr title="digital versatile disc">DVD</abbr> and played a game on their mobile.
		After a while, they went to sleep, so I left.
	</p>
	<p>
		After I got back home, I implemented pretty much all the things I talked about wanting to put in <code>minestats</code> yesterday.
		The mod could use a bit more interface polish, I guess, but the mod&apos;s pretty freakin&apos; sweet at this point, if you ask me.
		Pretty much all other mods I build are going to hook into this one in some way, or more specifically, hook into <code>minequest</code>, which itself hooks into this one.
		Most dependencies on this mod will likely be soft though.
		I haven&apos;t started on <code>minequest</code> again yet, but I&apos;ll get there when I get there.
	</p>

		Yesterday, the head manager found a pizza cutter they didn&apos;t like and were going to throw it away.
		They asked if anyone wanted though, so I spoke up.
		Someone had managed to melt the thing&apos;s handle, probably by leaving a hot pan on it or something.
		The thick, plastic handle is still quite structurally sound, but there&apos;s now a sharp protrusion that digs into the user&apos;s hand, depending on how they hold it.
		Personally, I think that can be filed off pretty easily, restoring the cutter to perfect usability.
		I forgot to bring it home though, so it got mixed in with the other tools this morning.
		The head manager stumbled upon the cutter again tonight though, so I got it back.
		This time, I actually brought it home.
		I&apos;m not sure how often I&apos;ll actually use a pizza cutter, but hey, I didn&apos;t have one and you never know if a random tool will one day come in handy.
