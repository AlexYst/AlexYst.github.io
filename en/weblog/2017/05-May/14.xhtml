	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I tried to meet up with my mother this morning, but they&apos;d already left.
		I left them a card though, along with all but one of my two-dollar bills.
		They collect those.
		Later in the day, they responded to a message I sent them upon arriving home, saying they were making their way home.
		Before work, I tried again.
		They still weren&apos;t home.
		My mother has a habit of not actually letting me know when they arrive when they know I&apos;m waiting for them, so, yeah, rude.
		And a waste of my time.
		Also, they still haven&apos;t responded to my message the other day.
		I thought they hadn&apos;t gotten it, but as they got today&apos;s message, I guess they were just ignoring me.
		Again, rude.
		Anyway, I&apos;ll probably try to meet up with them on my next day off, if there&apos;s time.
	</p>
	<p>
		It wasn&apos;t the response I was expecting, but someone has already asked if I can get <a href="https://forum.minetest.net./viewtopic.php?t=17599#p269521"><code>minestats</code> to support <code>unified_inventory</code></a>!
		It turns out <code>unified_inventory</code>&apos;s <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> isn&apos;t flexible enough to allow this in a clean way though.
		I&apos;ve added partial support, but I refuse to engage in the mess I think I&apos;d have to to provide full support.
		I&apos;ve asked for an <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> update in <a href="https://forum.minetest.net./viewtopic.php?p=269635#p269635"><code>unified_inventory</code></a>, but short of actually getting one, I don&apos;t see full support as an option.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems this time, University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> marked both my courses as paid for, so we won&apos;t have a repeat of last term&apos;s panic.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, one customer dropped their payment in my tip jar instead of handing it to me.
		That was strange.
		They didn&apos;t actually tip me at all, but it looked like they tipped me $20 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>!
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my coworkers stuffed the crust of a pizza with egg rolls.
		I obviously don&apos;t eat eggs, but I wonder how that&apos;d be with those delicious spring rolls from the Dollar Tree.
		I stopped at Fred Meyer after work to pick up dairy-free cheese and soy crumbles for the pizza, but they&apos;re out of the soy crumbles.
		I ended up getting meatless hot dogs instead.
		This should turn out interesting.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
