			<h1>Notary services are pretty inexpensive.</h1>
			<p>Day 00788: Wednesday, 2017 May 03</p>

<section id="general">
	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I was very unmotivated today, but I did get some stuff done.
		First, some research on notaries.
		I found a <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/where-to-notarize-affidavit-896914">list of places that might provide gratis notary services</a>!
		And if I don&apos;t find a gratis one, it won&apos;t be a big deal.
		It seems there&apos;s a <a href="http://punny.org./money/maximum-notary-fees-by-state-dont-get-ripped-off-by-big-fat-notary-guys/">legal cap on the price notaries can charge</a> in most states.
		Here in Oregon, the limit is $5 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		Once my name is changed, I won&apos;t need to keep going back, and as a one-time fee, that really isn&apos;t much.
		I checked with my local public library, and they don&apos;t offer notary services.
		I checked with the police station, and likewise, nothing.
		Tomorrow, I&apos;ll check with my bank.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was at the police station, I found they have a courthouse in the same building.
		I&apos;d assumed there wasn&apos;t a courthouse in Springfield and I&apos;d have to bike all the way to the one in Eugene.
		I asked about it though, and I still have to head to the Eugene courthouse.
		The local one can&apos;t do name changes.
	</p>
	<p>
		I arrived at my mother&apos;s place, but apparently late.
		Yesterday, when I was messaging with my mother, I was using my mother&apos;s preferred method of communication <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>.
		Google had let me back into my account for the time being.
		However, they quickly locked me out again.
		They keep letting me back in for short periods of time, even if I don&apos;t try to contact them about the problem.
		At this point, I&apos;m convinced Google&apos;s just toying with me (though probably not literally).
		In any case, my mother messaged me that they arrived home earlier, so I should come over earlier, but being locked out of my account, I couldn&apos;t retrieve <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages.
		It&apos;s become clear that Google Voice is far too unreliable to be useful.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, I should focus on either drafting up the legal documents I need, familiarising myself with the name change procedure, or getting my coursework completed early so I can focus on the other two more.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

		The enrolment period for next term&apos;s courses is coming up on the thirteenth.
		Looking at my prerequisites tree, the obvious choices I should make are to take CS 1103: Programming 2 and CS 2203: Databases 1.
		CS 1103 opens up several other courses I need and is unproctored.
		I&apos;d kind of like to take as many of my proctored courses as I can during the same terms (that is, I want to take a second proctored course during any term I take one in), and the only other hard requirement course I have left and have met the prerequisites for is CS 2203.
		On a related note, this&apos;ll buy be a bit more time.
		I&apos;ll be able to take all my proctored courses under my preferred name!
		I could end up making connections through proctor-seeking, so it&apos;ll be nice to have those connections made under my permanent name instead of the name I&apos;m giving up.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve finished up my proofreading, and&apos;ve submitted all my coursework that&apos;s due tonight and the next night.
