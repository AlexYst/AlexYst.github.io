	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m feeling much better today.
		First of all, a certain dark cloud that&apos;s been sitting over me for at least a week is gone.
		I&apos;d rather not discuss the details of that though.
		But secondly, our discussion topic in <span title="Web Programming 1">CS 2205</span> this week is responsive design.
		I knew that yesterday, but I didn&apos;t know what &quot;responsive design&quot; even meant.
		After completing some of the reading though, I see it&apos;s something I&apos;ve been in favour of for a long while: building pages that adapt to the device that views them as opposed to idiotically building separate pages for separate devices, handicapping your users, and not giving them the option to see the information they actually want.
		The thing is, when we&apos;re being taught good practices, I get happy because I see <strong>*the other students*</strong> are being taught this.
		I see the likelihood of a better future.
		That said, when we&apos;re taught to do things the wrong way, it stresses me out because while <strong>*I*</strong> know it&apos;s the wrong way, at least some of the other students probably don&apos;t and are taking to heart bad practices.
		I see the likelihood of a continuation of the current mess of the world.
