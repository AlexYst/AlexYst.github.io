	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I was reminded in my experiments today of the vessel group used for crafting in Minetest.
		Because of this group, the value of glass and the value of steel are proportional; specifically, one steel is worth two glass.
		Interesting.
	</p>
	<p>
		My student load servicer was asking for money again, so once more, I paid them more than they asked for.
		While I was at it, I took a look at how much more I owe and how much I have in my credit union account.
		I can almost pay off my debt now!
		In two days, it&apos;ll be pay day, and the next chance I get, I can deliver that cheque to the credit union, wait for it to clear, then be rid of the student loan servicer forever.
		I really don&apos;t like them because of their terrible website that I have no choice but to use, though I don&apos;t have anything else against them.
		I may or may not be able to be finished with them with this next pay cheque, but I should be able to be rid of them with the one after that.
	</p>
	<p>
		But then it hit me: the fifth isn&apos;t just pay day; it&apos;s also the day rent is due!
		I had no choice but to, either today or tomorrow, head to the credit union and get the rent cheque.
		Being so close to being out of debt, or so I thought, I&apos;d mixed my living funds with the cash I needed to take to the credit union for deposit.
		I have no idea how much I had, so I can&apos;t unmix the two and continue my living-on-tips exercise.
		I don&apos;t think that&apos;ll be a big problem, though it would present an issue later in the day.
		My downstairs neighbour sold me their bike!
		Unfortunately, they aren&apos;t able to ride any more due to their poor leg strength; they need a cane to walk properly.
		The bike was just taking up room in their house, so they were happy to be rid of it.
		The bike&apos;s purple and glittery.
		I guess if I were cisgendered, that might bother me, but because I&apos;m not, I just find it mildly amusing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can&apos;t use the bike just yet because I need to get a new U-lock for it first; a U-lock made by <strong>*anyone*</strong> but Bell!
		I&apos;ve also been instructed to avoid one other company by a friend, but as I don&apos;t have any experience with that company&apos;s products, I won&apos;t mention which company to avoid tarnishing the name of a potentially-good company.
		I knew I needed to get the tires inflated tonight though, so I could let them sit full of air overnight and see if the inner tubes still hold air.
		If not, I&apos;ll need to replace the inner tubes when I buy the new lock.
		I don&apos;t think I mentioned it at the time, but on the day I bought my bike pump, the thing tipped over due to its unstable design, and as I was pumping with my foot (as text on the pump says is the <strong>*only*</strong> proper way to use the pump), the pump took a pretty hard smack into the ground.
		Since then, the pump&apos;s peddle has been bent and the rubber pad on the peddle won&apos;t stay on well due to the acquired deformity.
		The base wasn&apos;t damaged, but the pump has continued to be as unstable as on day zero.
		Today is the first time I&apos;ve used the pump since the U-lock incident (Why would I need to use a pump while I can&apos;t even access my bike, after all?), so it&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve used it while hyper-aware of the Bell brand.
		As it turns out, this pump was made by them too!
		Not only was their lock designed so poorly that it wouldn&apos;t open, but their pump was designed too poorly to stay upright when used the only way in which they planned for it to be used!
		I&apos;m not thinking the Bell company is good at constructing things at all.
		I was already going to avoid buying their other products on principle, but I guess I should avoid them for quality reasons as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went searching for some information in my journal that I thought likely not to be there, and as expected, I didn&apos;t find it.
		I did find some typos to fix though, and I was forced to recall Coos Bay&apos;s terrain.
		I may be having bad luck now (which is hopefully ending now), but at least I&apos;m not in Coos Bay.
		I&apos;m here in mostly-flat Springfield, where travel by foot and bicycle are incredibly easy.
