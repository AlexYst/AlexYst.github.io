		It turns out the &quot;torn seam&quot; on my rainbow heart tee-shirt isn&apos;t a torn seam at all.
		It&apos;s torn fabric along the seam.
		I can&apos;t fix that.
		I can patch it, but I can&apos;t fix it.
		The thin cloth of this shirt makes it so it won&apos;t last as long as other shirts, and I have to accept that.
		I&apos;ll only be able to keep it in good repair for so long.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turns out I&apos;m not turning bi after all.
		My subconscious has likely not even been chipping away at that task.
		I just fell victim to another one of my confusing mood shifts.
		Today, I&apos;m back to full-on gay and back in my right mind.
		I can probably be happy alone or with a male, but there&apos;s pretty much nno way I&apos;ll be happy with a female.
		That&apos;s just not happening.
		I&apos;m getting real tired of these stupid mood shifts in my sexuality.
	</p>
	<p>
		I biked to Trillium headquarters, where they updated my postal address in their system.
		Hopefully that will be the end of the account nonsense.
		I also asked bout contact information, and it seems they have none.
		Because their website maliciously discriminates against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users, I have to bike to Eugene any time I need to speak with them.
		They said I can send them letters via post to save time, but let&apos;s be honest here: that&apos;ll take even more time.
		Sure, I won&apos;t need to find time to bike in, but I&apos;ll have to wait a week or two for a response.
		If any sort of back and forth is required, it&apos;ll quickly add up.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been failing to keep on task with my coursework as much as I feel I should be, but it&apos;s still working out well this week.
		Not too much has been going wrong and eating my time, and I&apos;ve been kind of getting at leas <strong>*some*</strong> work done most days.
		Today, I finished what I could.
		All I have left is the discussion assignment that I don&apos;t have the ability to complete until at least one more student joins the conversation.
