	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		The bike tires are still full from yesterday.
		I won&apos;t be needing new inner tubes.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m in another one of my moods in which my brain tells me I could actually be bisexual.
		I&apos;ve learned how to quickly prove to myself I&apos;m really gay by now though, so these moods are getting less confusing and easier to deal with.
		I kind of wonder if they&apos;ll ever go away entirely, but either way, they won&apos;t plague me any more.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was at my mother&apos;s place and she wouldn&apos;t let me get to sleep for the night.
		But then I remembered I don&apos;t live there, and started to head home where she wouldn&apos;t be able to keep me up.
		Before I left though, she wanted me to haul something outside for her.
		I woke up before I finished taking it out.

		Course registration for next term opens up tomorrow, so I took a look at what I need for next term.
		I&apos;d like to get proctored courses out of the way first, but it&apos;s more important that I get the prerequisites of other courses out of the way so I can take those other courses when needed.
		Looking at my course prerequisite tree again, I&apos;m not sure the courses I&apos;m taking this term were the right ones to take just then, and I should&apos;ve probably taken them in the coming term.
		Instead, I should&apos;ve taken <span title="Computer Systems">CS 1104</span> to allow access to <span title="Communications and Networking">CS 2204</span>.
		I should&apos;ve taken a second unproctored course to go along with it too, so as to have the fewest proctored terms, as I&apos;ve been planning.
		So now, in the coming term, I should take <span title="Computer Systems">CS 1104</span> as I should&apos;ve taken before, along with <span title="Software Engineering 1">CS 2401</span>.
		After that, I should take another term of proctored courses.
		I&apos;ll wait to plan further though, as after that next proctored term, there are advantages to both another proctored term or and an unproctored term.
		If I proctor, I can finish the last of the courses I&apos;m absolutely required to take as one course, but will need my second course to be an elective.
		If I don&apos;t proctor, I can take two semi-electives, of which I don&apos;t need specific courses to fill, but I do need courses from very small option sets.
		In the first case, my elective course for my two-year degree can simply be a required course from the four-year degree I plan to work on later.
		In the second case, I&apos;ll need to put in cement my course selections.
		I&apos;ve already made the decisions as to which courses to take, so that won&apos;t take long, but the finalisation of the courses does make me a bit nervous.
		For now, all I have to do to switch my plans is edit a few lines of code on my site, but once I&apos;ve registered with the university, there&apos;s no turning back.
