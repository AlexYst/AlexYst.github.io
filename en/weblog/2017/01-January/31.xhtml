	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I had a closing shift last night, so of course I didn&apos;t get to sleep until past midnight.
		However, I keep waking up before 8:00, despite my string of closing shifts.
		I&apos;m getting more and more tired as I lose sleep every night.
		When I woke up, I didn&apos;t even want to go home and do laundry, but I knew that I had to.
		I never found time to fix my laundry bag either; I&apos;m a bit behind in getting things done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday before work, I bought a bunch of quarters.
		I almost never have very many, as I deposit my change at a credit union and withdraw one-dollar bills.
		Last week, I spent every last quarter that I had on laundry, so I needed more for today.
		Carrying my laundry bag, my laptop, my backpack full of clothing hangers, and that folding chair was quite a pain.
		I&apos;m considering getting a baby stroller or something to carry stuff in in the future.
		Once I got home, I dropped everything off in my apartment, then headed to the laundry room to see if there were free washing machines.
		If not, I had other things that I needed to do, but if so, I&apos;d need to get my laundry started right away as to not miss my chance.
		I found that not only were all of the washing machines free, one of them had already been payed for!
		Thank you, anonymous stranger, you saved me a dollar and a half.
		I then set a timer to let me know when the laundry would be close to finished, and went back to my apartment to get stuff done.
		First, I set up the folding chair.
		It&apos;s missing a couple of the foot caps, so I had to put it in my carpeted bedroom. Everywhere else, save for the studdy alcove and the living room that I promised to my mother for storage, has linoleum.
		Until I replace the foot caps, I don&apos;t want to risk damaging the floor.
		I hung up the hangers, then went out to update the name on the tag in the mailbox.
		While the correction fluid dried, I got to work examining the apartment and filling out the paperwork on the condition of the place.
		I should have done this last week before school started, but I failed to remember to bring a pen.
		My timer went off before I even really had time to get much of the paperwork filled out, so I went back to the laundry room.
		I couldn&apos;t leave, as I&apos;d need to be there to feed the machines quarters every ten minutes, so I brought my laptop with me and started working on coursework.
		This time, I brought the mobile that we&apos;ve been using as a Wi-Fi hotspot, so I could actually get some of my coursework done.
		For some reason, I can&apos;t get my laptop to connect to the hotspot that it provides, but I can use <code>adb</code> to forward a local port to a port on the device.
		All that I have to do is shut down the laptop&apos;s <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> instance, then forward my local <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> port to the mobile&apos;s <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> port.
		After that, everything just silently works.
		I got a chunk of the reading assignment done, but my clothing finished drying and it was time to head back home to finish the paperwork.
		Somewhere along the way, my mobile had been woken up and put into camera mode, so the thing&apos;s battery was nearly dead.
		I let it recharge while I hung my clothing so that I could continue photographing the flaws in my apartment as I filled out the paperwork.
		Strangely, one of the light switches doesn&apos;t seem to do anything.
		I thought that it controlled the electrical outlets in the living room (which is a horrid design choice, if you ask me), but the electrical outlets all work no matter how the switch is set.
		I can&apos;t find anything that that switch seems to operate.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		My program advisor wrote back, saying that I should try updating my address information from the student portal instead of the classroom interface, if that&apos;s not what I&apos;ve already tried.
		No information was provided for if that <strong>*is*</strong> what I&apos;ve been trying, and it is.
		Is there even the option to change the address information from the classroom interface?
		I doubt it.
		They also said that they recommend paying via credit card.
		I had just told them that PayPal was being a pain, so I was trying to avoid using PayPal.
		I think that when people think that someone doesn&apos;t want to pay using PayPal, they actually don&apos;t want to pay using a <strong>*PayPal account*</strong>.
		The account isn&apos;t the problem (well, the account that PayPal created without my consent that they locked my credit card number to technically is the problem), the problem is that PayPal won&apos;t take my card even <strong>*without*</strong> an account (because they&apos;re demanding that I log into an account that I did not choose to create and do not have the password for).
		I more throughly explained the situation, and emphasized that <strong>*PayPal*</strong> is being horrid, not a PayPal account is being horrid.
		I then asked if there actually is a way to pay via credit card without PayPal.
		The advisor did actually provide the details on paying via cashier&apos;s cheque though, so I will be able to pay for school.
		It&apos;ll cost extra in postage, but maybe that&apos;s worth it to be sure that PayPal isn&apos;t getting a cut of it.
		I&apos;ll still need to use PayPal for a while longer though whenever Marc&apos;s sales come up.
		C&apos;mon, Bandcamp!
		Offer a non-PayPal payment option please!
	</p>
	<p>
		I also wrote up the beginnings of my <span title="Ethics and Social Responsibility">PHIL 1404</span>, though I think that I&apos;m going to have to reread a lot of the assigned material tomorrow while I finish it up.
		The essay itself is a mess, full of unformatted notes and such, so it&apos;s not even ready for release in a partial state.
		This week&apos;s been awful, and I&apos;m going to have to rush to even get this essay finished on time.
		I should have skipped straight to the case study first, then read the rest and filled in the essay as I read.
