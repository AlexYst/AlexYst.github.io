	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I took a look at the paperwork that the Oregon Health Plan people sent me, but it says that they wanted it sent back two months ago.
		This is stupid, especially considering that I sent in my application online before that paperwork even arrived in the mail.
		Hopefully, it had already been in the mail when I submitted my online application.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to the website, where they told me that my application was incomplete.
		I tried filling it out again.
		but part way through filling it out, they canceled my application and said that I already had an application, that it had been denied, and that I somehow had coverage anyway.
		When I went to look for this information later, it had disappeared, so I tried filling out the application again, expecting to be cut off again and shown the information.
		Instead, I wasn&apos;t cut off, I completed the application, and the application page says that the application was submitted successfully.
		<del>However, the dashboard page still says that I need to complete my application, though I no longer have a way to access said application.</del> <ins>Scratch that.
		A different dashboard says that there are no ongoing applications, which would align with the fact that this application is no longer ongoing, but complete.</ins> This stupid website is a mess.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way to work, I took my paycheck to First Tech Federal Credit Union across the street.
		I really do prefer Oregon Community Credit Union, but I didn&apos;t have time to go there today.
		As usual, the First Tech representative asked me for my Social Security number, and as usual, I told them that I don&apos;t cary my Social Security card on me.
		Everyone expects you to memorize your Social Security number and identify yourself by it, but I have a name! I refuse to identify myself as a number.
		As usual, the representative didn&apos;t even actually <strong>*need*</strong> my Social Security number to access my account, either.
		If they ever did, I&apos;d shut down my account and withdraw my funds after bringing in my Social Security card so that they&apos;d even be able to give me my money back.
		Oregon Community Credit Union <strong>*never*</strong> asks me for my Social Security number.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two of my shift leaders recognized the <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> logo on my shirt! That was pretty awesome.
		One shift leader doesn&apos;t use <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> though, and I couldn&apos;t tell if the other was joking about using it.
		If they use it though, it sounds like they only use it to access the dark Web.
		Still, the fact that they even recognized the logo at all is pretty sweet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I had a closing shift, but I strangely didn&apos;t end up stationed at the drive-through.
		Instead, I ended up stationed at the oven landing.
		Stranger still, I ended up sent home early, which is something that can&apos;t happen, no matter how slow we are, when on a closing shift.
		I was kind of confused.
		Today though, I was back on the drive-through window and remained until we finished closing the store.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I awoke in the middle of the night.
		It was far too early to get up, so I went back to bed.
		As such, I recalled two dreams.
	</p>
	<h3>Dream 0</h3>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I learned that my siblings and I are either half extra terrestrial or full extra terrestrial.
		Vivian&apos;s magic-teaching mentor used some sort of spell to allow Vivian to look back in time at any moment of Vivian&apos;s life and I was somehow able to watch what Vivian saw, which is how we found out.
		When our minds returned to the present, we had so many questions, but we&apos;d only be able to uncover more after learning more magic.
		The spell had only been a demonstration of what Vivian would be able to do with training, and learning that we weren&apos;t human hadn&apos;t actually been the goal.
		We learned that our mother and our mother&apos;s family were extra terrestrials, but it wasn&apos;t clear whether our human father was our biological father.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we returned to the present, we were outside, surrounded by chain link fences in a forest, with trees grown up against the fences in several spots, including the chain link fence ceiling.
		Wildlife such as beavers were pretty close to the fence, so we were able to get a very good look at them.
	</p>
	<h3>Dream 1</h3>
	<p>
		In another dream, my mother was having difficulties with their mobile.
		Some files on it had gone missing, but those files seemed to be on their desktop machine.
		I tried to help by bringing out my own <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cord and transferring the files to the mobile, but that didn&apos;t end well.
		My mother tried to jack my cord, insisting that I leave it with my mother at all times even though I need it myself.
		This wouldn&apos;t have worked in the real world though, as my mother&apos;s mobile is a stupid iPhone; it&apos;s not compatible with <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cords.
	</p>

<section id="apartment">
	<h2>Apartment hunting</h2>
	<p>
		I looked into Emerald Property Management&apos;s offerings, and it seems that they require that I make three times the amount of rent per month.
		I don&apos;t make that much though.
		I can cover two times the rent on some of their properties, but not three times.
		I submitted an application anyway though, as the website didn&apos;t specify which properties have this requirement and which don&apos;t.
		I applied for units at two different locations, each offering units for $520 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per month.
	</p>

<section id="docmod">
	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
