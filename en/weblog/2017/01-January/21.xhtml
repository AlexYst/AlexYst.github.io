	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		In my rush last night, I forgot to fully cover the deposit that the utility company&apos;s going to make me have on my account.
		If I keep my account in good standing for a year or I close the account, I get the deposit back.
		In other words, unless I&apos;m super pressed for cash at the moment, there&apos;s zero advantage to having the utility company run a credit check on me or getting a cosigner.
		I&apos;m still in awe that the utility company was probably going to run a credit check on me without my knowledge and without my consent.
		That seems like a very underhanded move.
	</p>
	<p>
		Last night at work started awful.
		I hadn&apos;t had time to rest all day and I didn&apos;t have time to prepare dinner before my shift.
		One of the shift leaders quickly picked up on the fact that I wasn&apos;t at 100%, saying that I wasn&apos;t my usual, bubbly self.
		As the night progressed though, I felt better and my mood improved.
		I ended up with two more two-dollar bills coming in, so I bought them with my tip money.
		I might keep them or I might give them to my mother.
		One thing that really helped with my mood was one customer that came through, saying that I&apos;m the only one that ever check their <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, even though their credit card has instructions to check their <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> so everyone should be doing it.
		It&apos;s sad that most people aren&apos;t reading it, as it means that it&apos;s not doing much good, but at least I&apos;m doing something right.
	</p>
	<p>
		I headed home with my box of shoes after work last night.
		I had brought this box to work with me from my mother&apos;s house.
		Along the way, I realized that my plan of bringing boxes of clothing each day is unnecessary and a waste of effort.
		Instead, I can simply haul a load of dirty clothing home whenever I need to do laundry, then leave all of the newly-washed clothing at home aside from my work uniforms.
		Little by little, my clothing will make it home.
		I don&apos;t have much else left here aside from my clothing and my file box, so after my file box is taken home, I&apos;ll probably only sometimes take a couple little things home if I happen to be heading home anyway.
		I had planned to take the file box home after work today, but that didn&apos;t work out.
		In my exhaustion, I forgot to pick up my schedule for the coming week last night!
		I didn&apos;t know for sure what hours I work tomorrow before I headed in to work today, so I couldn&apos;t bring the file box with me.
		Most likely, I&apos;d have a morning shift right after my evening shift, as that seems to be how my schedule typically ends up on Saturday and Sunday lately.
		Once I got home, I rested for about ten minutes before heading to my mother&apos;s house.
		While I was resting, I checked out the drawers in the kitchen and found that one of them doens&apos;t open all the way without opening the stove first, as the stove door&apos;s handle blocks the drawer.
		Also, I realized the problem with living in an upstairs apartment.
		I have to be very quiet at nigh, as my floor is someone else&apos;s ceiling! I&apos;d rather deal with their noise than worry about disturbing them.
		Living downstairs would be better.
		during my rest, I also set up my physical music collection on one of the built-in shelves.
		I&apos;ve never been able to set that up at my mother&apos;s house, so it give the place a homey feel for me.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that taken care of, I headed back to my mother&apos;s place, where my mattress is, to get some well-deserved sleep.
	</p>
	<p>
		It feels like forever since I&apos;ve had any coursework.
		I&apos;m kind of missing school.
		That said, this break between terms has been extremely helpful.
		I&apos;m not sure how I would have kept up with school, work, and getting my apartment set up all at once.
	</p>
	<p>
		It occurred to me today that perhaps forgetting my wallet at home was a spot of good luck for me.
		Had I had the wallet on me, I&apos;d have paid a visit to the post office near the property manager&apos;s main office.
		In that case, my mail key would likely end up at that post office.
		Instead, I went to the post office near my own home, so that&apos;s where th email key will likely surface.
	</p>
	<p>
		I spent most of the day not getting anything of consequence done.
		Mainly, I just needed rest from yesterday.
		At first, I thought that perhaps traveling between home and my mother&apos;s place on an almost daily basis as I&apos;d planned to do wasn&apos;t such a good idea.
		After all, it really wore me out yesterday, right?
		But that wasn&apos;t the real problem yesterday.
		The problem was that I got no time to sit down and rest at all.
		A simple extra walk shouldn&apos;t be a problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today was an easy day at work though.
		Based on my scheduled work time, I expected to be stationed at my least-favorite station, the one where we flatten dough all day, but instead, I was stationed at the drive-through window, the station that I love but almost everyone else seems to hate.
		It was certainly a good place to be while I wasn&apos;t feeling like I was at 100%.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to deposit my paycheck today, but I didn&apos;t get into the credit union quickly enough.
		I forgot that today is Saturday, so they closed several hours early.
		I&apos;d have either had to make a special trip to make it on time or have gone to work way early to hit the credit union on my way to work as I actually tried to do without heading in too early.
		It&apos;s so inconvenient that business schedules are different depending on the day of the week that it is.
		It seems so arbitrary, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I was an employee working at a restaurant with a menu with items from both Taco Bell&apos;s menu and Little Caesars&apos; menu, though the inside looked partially like a warehouse store and partially like an actual fast food restaurant back area.
		I kept putting together the drive-through customer&apos;s order, but the partial order kept disappearing before I could complete it!
		Someone kept taking it.
		Eventually, we ran out of tortillas, the customer had been waiting for about forty minutes, and I had no idea how to make more tortillas.
		There was also a long line at the drive-through window.
		I was starting to freak out.
		Eventually, I gave up on having someone else make the tortillas (it wasn&apos;t my job to make the food, I was the one selling it), and I asked a fellow employee how to make them.
		They didn&apos;t know either.
		At that moment, tortillas started popping out of one of the nearby machines one by one, showing us both where they came from, though not what ingredients needed to be added to the machine to make it do that again later.
		I woke up though before I could finally complete the order.
