		Glitchedpuppet released a new album, <a href="https://floraverse.bandcamp.com/album/neon-phase-ost">NEON PHASE - OST</a>.
		It&apos;s the soundtrack to <a href="https://eevee.itch.io/neon-phase">NEON PHASE</a>, a new game that is a bit difficult to get at the source code to.
		When I saw the game after waking up in the middle of the night, I thought that there was no source code available.
		However, after reading about &quot;.love&quot; files, I now know that they&apos;re just ZIP files full of source code with a non-standard file extension.
		However, even after replacing &quot;.love&quot; with &quot;.zip&quot; in the file name, I was still unable to get Xarchiver to recognize the file format.
		Before that though I tried opening it in a text editor, as I had thought that I remembered that &quot;.love&quot; files were text source files, so I saw the first twenty bytes: <code>#!/usr/bin/env love</code> (followed by a new line character).
		Shortly after those bytes though, the text editor got confused and didn&apos;t display the rest.
		However, that&apos;s clearly not something that belongs in a ZIP file!
		I tried removing it, and that makes the file open perfectly.
		The command for removing the first twenty bytes of a file from the command line is <code>dd bs=20 skip=1 if=NEON\ PHASE.love of=NEON\ PHASE.zip</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It looks like the version of LÖVE from the Debian repositories is just slightly too old to run this game.
		I&apos;ll have to try it again next time that the Debian Project releases a new stable version of their operating system.
	</p>
	<p>
		I finally finished copying the text from <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/human-slushy">The Early Stuff CD</a>&apos;s case and actual <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> into a plain text file.
		Now the album&apos;s ready for archival!
		Currently though, I have my entire archive on a single external hard drive.
		What happens if that hard drive dies?
		I need to find a place to stick a backup copy of my music archive.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to pick up a copy of this album, you&apos;d better hurry.
		According to the website, there&apos;s only five copies left.
		That said, according to the website after I purchased the album, it was sold out.
		I had the last copy.
		Who knows how many more copies are still floating around?
		Still, it probably isn&apos;t many.

		I washed another small load of laundry again today by hand.
		This is really getting old.
		I can&apos;t wait until I&apos;ve moved into my apartment and have actual washing machines and dryers at my disposal.
		I don&apos;t want to pack dirty clothing though, so I&apos;ll probably wash most if not all of my clothing by hand before I bring it.
		Speaking of washing, I also scrubbed at some of the walls and doors around the house to prepare the house for sale.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went out to the post office to grab the change-of-address forms that I&apos;ll need in a few days.
		It rained a bit on the way, but not too much.
	</p>
	<p>
		Someone brought a new concept to my attention: <a href="http://rhodesmill.org./brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/">semantic line feeds</a>.
		I don&apos;t entirely agree with the premise, which is that each clause should be on its own line to make later editing easier, but a good middle ground between that and having everything on the same line is useful.
		Specifically, I&apos;m going to start putting each sentence on its own line when writing pages on my website.
		I think that this will make it much easier to find and correct sentences when mistakes are found.
	</p>
	<p>
		Previously, I strongly believed my mother to be bipolar.
		Now, I&apos;m not as sure.
		They discussed the symptoms that they experience on their period, and one of them is that they get &quot;weepy&quot;.
		Could it be that their frequent mood swings are simply a symptom of <abbr title="premenstrual syndrome">PMS</abbr>?
		That wouldn&apos;t make the problem any easier to deal with, but it would mean that there&apos;s nothing <strong>*medically*</strong> wrong with my mother.
		That&apos;s good, but it&apos;s also bad.
		My siblings and I have been dealing with this problem for as long as I can remember.
		If there&apos;s nothing wrong, there&apos;s nothing that can be fixed, so this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.
		That said, it&apos;s not like my mother was going to go get diagnosed anyway, so it&apos;s not like they actually <strong>*would*</strong> be seeking help.
	</p>
	<p>
		I rewatched the <a href="http://floraverse.com./comic/try-try-again/365-try-try-again-part-1/">Try, Try Again - Part 1</a> video, and it seems that it still contains a reference to the redacted Curiosity Killed the Rat Part 1 - Wait and See video.
		That video is supposedly no longer cannon, but clearly, the events that it depicted still are.
		When everything&apos;s tied together as much as it is in Floraverse, it&apos;s really difficult to simply remove pieces of the story from cannon.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h3>Dream 0</h3>
	<p>
		I dreamed that despite having not yet seen the apartment and not yet moving in, the property managers were already trying via email to get me to pay rent.
	</p>
	<h3>Dream 1</h3>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I had made a mistake and that the source code to NEON PHASE had been released.
		It was downloadable as a separate ZIP file, on the same page, clearly in sight, but I&apos;d somehow missed it the first time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also tried to wash some ants off of something and down the sink drain, but the ants kept clinging to one another and forming thick chains.
		They grabbed onto the faucet through the rushing water, then some climbed to safety from there.
		For some reason, I thought that it would help if I broke the surface tension, so I pulled the plunger knob so the sink wouldn&apos;t drain so I could add soap.
		After the ants were stuck, I would drain the sink.
		However, pulling up on the plunger knob revealed that several ants had gotten down in the knob&apos;s shaft itself, and there was a whole pile of various types of insects in there with the ants.
		I considered giving up on my goal of removing the ants.
	</p>
	<p>
		At that point, the cat startled me by jumping up onto my side and grabbing onto me.
		I stopped to deal with the cat, which is about when I woke up.

	<h2 id="university">University life</h2>
	<p>
		I was just notified today that for some reason, I have a new program advisor.
		Last time that this happened, I was transitioning from my first term, in which I was not technically considered a degree-seeking student, to my second term, in which I was technically a student of computer science.
		This time, there&apos;s no real change.
		Does that mean that students are assigned a different program advisor each term?
		That seems sort of counter-productive.
		In my case, it&apos;s fine, but what if there are special circumstances surrounding a particular student?
		In that case, that student will need to explain their needs every single term.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have now gotten notification that both of my courses for next term have been approved.
		Sweet!
		Now I just need to wait for my courses to begin.
