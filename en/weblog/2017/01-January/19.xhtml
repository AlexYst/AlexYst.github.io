	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		There wasn&apos;t enough money in my account at the one credit union that I knew to provide gratis cashier&apos;s cheques, so I headed to the other credit union of which I&apos;m a member of.
		My mission was to ask about cashier&apos;s cheques, then get one if they don&apos;t cost.
		If they do cost, I would instead withdraw money to take to the other credit union and get one there.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was in the area, I stopped by the mobile shop in the same building as the credit union to pay my bill.
		There were only two representatives in though, and both were dealing with customers that had longer transactions involving getting new devices and copying data over from the old devices.
		I waited in line about half an hour, at which point a third representative showed up, seemingly early for their shift.
		They clocked on early to help with the line that had formed, with me at the head of it.
		The representative introduced me to a new type of account, one that doesn&apos;t have the stupid E911 fee.
		They tried to get me to flash <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> and tell them my date of birth, but I claimed that as a pedestrian, I didn&apos;t carry <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> and that I didn&apos;t want my date of birth on the account.
		The representative was fine without either, so I&apos;m not sure why they asked for them.
		I honestly don&apos;t want my date of birth on the account and would usually say that my date of birth is 1970-01-01, but I can&apos;t pull off that date of birth in person.
		As for my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, as a pedestrian, I also usually don&apos;t have that on me.
		However, as I was headed to the credit union next, I actually did have that on me.
		This new account seems to not be able to take my current account&apos;s resources, so I couldn&apos;t transfer my existing service days over.
		The representative didn&apos;t seem to understand why I&apos;d want to wait to switch, as my account is depleted of high-speed data for the month, but it still has service days and unlimited low-speed data.
		Until those service days are used up, throwing them away by switching accounts would be a waste of money.
		It seems that my service expires on the twenty-seventh, so I should go back to the mobile shop at about that time.
		It costs five dollars to get the new account, as it seems that they have to sell me a new <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card, but it also will save me three quarters of a dollar each month.
		The account will pay for its startup fee in seven months.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I had hoped, Oregon Community Credit Union was able to provide the gratis cashier&apos;s cheque that I was after.
		I&apos;m not sure if First Tech Federal Credit Union has a limit to the number of gratis cashier&apos;s cheques that they&apos;ll give you, but Oregon Community Credit Union has a limit of one per day, after which you must pay for them.
		One per day, though? That seems like far more than I&apos;ll need in the foreseeable future.
		After confirming that cashier&apos;s cheques are available, the representative tried to talk me into opening a chequing account.
		I explained that I&apos;ve held chequing accounts with the credit union in the past, but that the credit union always closes them on me due to my infrequent use of said accounts.
		I also explained that if I could get a card issued to a second party, the account would see much more use, and I&apos;d actually be excited to open such an account because a particular merchant isn&apos;t accepting cards issued by Discover.
		The representative explained that to have such a card issued, I&apos;d need to have this second person come in and open a primary savings account, at which point we could set up a joint account together.
		Obviously, this isn&apos;t going to work for my purposes though, so I didn&apos;t open up any new accounts.
	</p>
	<p>
		There&apos;s been one particular cold spot that&apos;s been bothering me lately.
		Almost all of the recent snow had melted, except in that spot.
		I&apos;m not sure why that spot, which is right were people would be walking, would somehow be colder than the surrounding areas to the point that retained its snow.
		In any case, on the way to work, I saw that it had all sudenly melted.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t head in to work as early as I usually do.
		I often try to make it about half an hour early, but I just wasn&apos;t feeling it today.
		Strangely, today was a good day not to show up early.
		The monitor of the computer in the back broke.
		No one could clock in.
		One of the shift leaders went next door to purchase a new monitor at the second-hand shop, but it took some time for the head manager to set it up.
		No one could clock in, so the head manager modified the digital time cards to reflect that we&apos;d clocked in at our scheduled times.
		Had I gotten there early, I would have been doing work that I wasn&apos;t being paid for.
		I sometimes work while clocked off, but I prefer to do it by choice, not because the time clock cannot be properly accessed.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my coworkers covered my register while I was on break.
		It seems that they got a two-dollar bill as a tip, but instead of keeping it, they gave it to me! I was going to give it to my mother, who collects them, but my coworker told me about a superstition that they have.
		They said that if you keep a two-dollar bill in your wallet, money is supposed to come your way.
		Of course, I don&apos;t believe that myself, but it seems like the nice thing to do now is to show appreciation by keeping it.
		If it ever comes up again, I can show that I still have it in my wallet.
	</p>
	<p>
		The work day mostly went smoothly, but I did have one very rued and uncooperative customer.
		I&apos;m tired of customers assuming that they should pull forward from the menu board before I&apos;ve told them to and before I&apos;m ready for them to, which they often do when they&apos;ve placed an order previously and are now coming back to pick it up.
		I&apos;m trying to make it a habit to tell them to wait at the board while I check on their order, where before, I&apos;d simply tell them that I&apos;d check on the order.
		I told this one customer to wait, and they asked why they even have to wait, then without my having responded, they pulled forward anyway.
		Then, when I open the window, they&apos;re out there smoking where I&apos;ve got to breathe it.
		It&apos;s illegal to smoke within ten feet of a public business&apos; window, so I told them that.
		They got even more annoyed, but wouldn&apos;t put out their cigarette.
		Some people are just jerks.

		I dreamed that I was trying to start a new business.
		I can&apos;t really remember the details though.

		Last night before I went to bed, I emailed the representative of the property managers that I&apos;ve been conversing with.
		I told them that I&apos;m still interested in the unit, and asked when I should come over to fill out the paperwork.
		I informed them that I&apos;m free both the nineteenth and the twentieth before 14:00, and that I could also come on another date, but that it would be past the hold expiration on the twentieth.
		I was hoping that they&apos;d meet with me today, but no such luck.
		They want to meet at 10:00 tomorrow.
		Still, that&apos;s not too far away though.
		It can&apos;t be too far away, as the hold expires soon.
