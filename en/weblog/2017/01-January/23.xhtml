		Discover says that they&apos;ll &quot;look into&quot; the charge that they incorrectly allowed to happen by my old registrar.
		I&apos;ll have to wait and see what happens from here.
		If they decide not to reverse the charge, I&apos;ll have no choice but to close my Discover account.
		I cannot replace what my Discover credit card provides, but if I can&apos;t trust Discover to take accountability for their own mistakes and I can&apos;t trust Discover with my money, I don&apos;t really have another option.

		I finally got around to asking the residents of the two neighbor houses that I thought that the bike lock from the other day might have come from.
		Neither person that I spoke with recognized the lock.
		Those were my only two leads too, so I won&apos;t be able to return the lock to its owner after all.
	</p>

		I applied to work as Ross almost a year ago, back when I lived in Coos Bay.
		Only <strong>*now*</strong> are they getting back to me and telling me that they&apos;re choosing a different candidate.
		Wow, they&apos;re slow.
		Even if they had said that they wanted to hire me, it&apos;s a bit too late for that now.
		Coos Bay is way too far away now to walk to work there.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, I took on extra hours by trading shifts with someone, but they insisted on not trading jobs until they left.
		They also didn&apos;t perform their cleaning task.
		As a result, I got stuck with the cleanup tasks for both my own job and their job.
		I don&apos;t mind the extra labor, but it meant that I wasn&apos;t able to finish on time.
		I don&apos;t mind the extra hours, but it makes the shift leaders look bad.
	</p>
	<p>
		The crown of voices stopped working on me.
		It claimed to be out of range.
		I assumed that this meant out of range of the base station, but I hadn&apos;t moved when it cut out.
		At first, I figured that the crown was broken, but when I tried swapping it out for one of the other crowns, it didn&apos;t help.
		At that point, I assumed that the base station was malfunctioning.
		After we closed, one of the shift leaders checked out the base station, and it had somehow come unplugged.
		Testing to see if the fix worked as it should have, and with all the customers having already gone home, I went outside, deepened my voice, and said &quot;All fear my big, booming voice!&quot;.
		That was fun, but technically, it was a legitimate test of the crown and the menu board speaker.
		Sure enough, the crown and speaker system are back in action!

		I received a letter from the school saying that i wasn&apos;t chosen for the New York trip.
		I already knew that I wouldn&apos;t be though.
		The chances of it happening were just too low.
		I also learned from today&apos;s letter that there were only two slots available for the trip!
		The odds of being chosen were even <strong>*slimmer*</strong> than I&apos;d presumed.
