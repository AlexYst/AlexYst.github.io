		Glitchedpuppet has just released a new album, <a href="https://floraverse.bandcamp.com/album/dissonant-dreams">Dissonant • Dreams</a>! I might pick up a copy once I&apos;m settled into my new apartment and have a better idea of how my finances will play out.

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I hand washed another load of laundry early this morning, but it looks like I might not have to keep doing this for much longer.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> wrote me a letter asking for my experience with and thoughts about the university, which will be shared with potential supporters of the school.
		It could be a pretty good opportunity! I&apos;ve started writing up my response, and will likely try to finish it up and submit it tomorrow.
	</p>

<section id="apartment">
	<h2>Apartment hunting</h2>
	<p>
		My rental application for apartment number thirteen at 250 F Street has been approved! I received an email just after midnight letting me know.
		However, the rental agency seems unwilling to continue communication through email, and requested that I give them a <a href="tel:+15417414676">telephone call</a>.
		Ugh.
		I wasn&apos;t going to make a telephone call at that late at night, so I waited until 10:00 to attempt to reach them.
		I had planned to call at around 08:00, but I couldn&apos;t bring myself to doing, seeing as I can&apos;t stand telephone calls.
		However, the call was in vain anyway.
		The person that I needed to reach was in a meeting.
		I left a message, but they never got back to me.
		It seems that they want to play telephone tag.
		I will have to call again tomorrow.
		At least the call that I made today should count as my one telephone call for the month to keep my service active.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have several questions that I need to ask them.
		Are there washing machines in the units or on the premises? I suppose that I&apos;ll have to take the unit either way out of desperation, but it would be nice to know before I move in if I&apos;m going to have to continue hand-washing my clothing.
		About how much do the utilities run? I should verify the rental price as well, which I believe to be $520 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		Finally, I need to ask about what payment methods they accept.
		It&apos;s unlikely that they accept cash, which would be my preferred method, but do they take credit cards? Hopefully at least one non-cheque method of payment.
		I really, <strong>*really*</strong> don&apos;t want to have to deal with cheques if I don&apos;t have to, but I&apos;ll do it if need be.
		I&apos;ll set up a separate account as to make sure that the cheque-spent funds are separated from my actual, usable funds until the cheques are cashed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I walked over to the apartment complex to take a look at the area, as well as try to get ahold of the property manager if I could.
		I didn&apos;t expect to actually be able to find them on the property, but I thought that I&apos;d better try, seeing as they wouldn&apos;t respond to me remotely.
		It rained the whole way there, but at least it wasn&apos;t overly cold rain.
		It seems to be helping melt the snow, too.
		When I got there, I found that the complex is called Imperial Arms and there are indeed property managers on the premises! Unfortunately, they seemed utterly clueless as to dealing with applicants and the apartment isn&apos;t ready for viewing yet, so I can&apos;t see the inside at the moment.
		They said that they&apos;d telephone me when the unit is ready to be showed.
		With an office on the property though, I shouldn&apos;t need to jump through any hoops to get my rent paid, such as walking to some distant office.
		The place seems to be about half an hour from my mother&apos;s house (until my mother moves to Sweet Home) and about twenty minutes from work, though the math doesn&apos;t add up right on that.
		I timed it, but perhaps I walked quicker on my way there than my way back.
		In any case, getting to work will be easily doable and getting my stuff moved from my mother&apos;s place to my new place will be doable on foot, though it&apos;ll take time and will be a bit of a pain.
	</p>
	<p>
		I talked to my coworkers on my way home, having just stopped by to time the walk to work.
		They&apos;ve informed me that these particular property managers love to play telephone tag, so I guess that I have that to look forward to.
		Additionally, the low rent cost is made possible by the fact that the property managers don&apos;t fix things right away, and when they do fix things, they only jury rig them instead of making actual repairs.
		The only way to get anything fixed at all is to either fix it myself or to wait about a month for the property managers to finally take care of it using a hacky fix.
		Additionally, it seems that there may or may not be a black mold problem.
		If there is, one of my coworkers is going to photograph a can of the only spray that they&apos;ve had success keeping black mold away with to show me what to look for in the store.
	</p>
	<p>
		As much as it frustrates me, I was only able to find this apartment due to help from one of my coworkers.
		Building out one&apos;s social network feels like such a burden, yet that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;m going to have to learn to do if I&apos;m going to get by in the world.
		Some jobs require contacts on the inside to obtain, or sometimes to even find.
		I hate it.
		In this case, I found important information through a contact that I made at work without any effort, but in most cases, I doubt that this will be enough.
		I&apos;m going to have to get good at schmoozing.
	</p>
	<p>
		This next while will likely be stressful, but after that, life will likely be much less eventful than it has been.
		Life here isn&apos;t exactly stable and my relationship with my mother isn&apos;t exactly healthy.
		Moving out will fix the stability issue though, and it&apos;ll also give me the leverage that I need with my mother.
		I can now threaten to cut my ties with them if they aren&apos;t going to chill out, and if they won&apos;t chill out, I can actually follow through.
		This relationship will be made healthy or I will cut it off like the cancer that it currently is.
		To keep my utility bill lower, I&apos;m probably going to turn my thermostat off.
		I&apos;ll need to invest in some warm clothing to compensate.
		I might not use a refrigerator either, as most of my vegan food doesn&apos;t need refrigeration.
		My nw place is fairly close to the public library, so I might be able to make due without a home Internet connection, provided that I stay on top of my <a href="/en/coursework/">coursework</a>.
		I&apos;ll need to make sure that I have it done by closing time at the library every week before the due dates.
		Being nearby might also be helpful in trying to get one of the librarians to be my exam proctor in future terms.
		After I&apos;m settled in, I should look for an inexpensive, second-hand bicycle.
		With a bike, most of the town should be within my reach.
