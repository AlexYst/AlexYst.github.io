	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I totted the microwave oven home as planned.
		It was a bit of a pain, but less of a pain than that cardboard box of personal effects that I brought over on the first day.
		From home, I headed to the post office to check on my key, which still isn&apos;t available yet.
		I&apos;m getting quite impatient.
		I wouldn&apos;t mind waiting if not for Marc&apos;s record sale with the bonus albums, but I&apos;m running out of time.
		I&apos;ll try again on Friday, probably, but it&apos;s likely that I won&apos;t find the time to check tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		After speaking to the postal worker, I left and did a small bit of exploring downtown.
		I&apos;ve been meaning to check out an over-street bridge leading between city hall and some other building (which turned out to be the Oregon Department of Transportation building), and it is indeed accessible to the public if you take the right path.
		I headed home to eat and rest, then headed back to my mother&apos;s place, stopping at one second hand shop along the way.
		They had a couple bicycles, which is what I was looking for, but they were a bit more than I want to pay right now.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		The coursework was made available today at 21:05.
		After thinking a bit, I decided to try working on <a title="Programming Fundamentals">CS 1101</a> first.
		The <a href="/en/coursework/CS1101/#Unit1">learning journal entry</a> for the week asks me to describe what I did and what my reactions were, so I&apos;m posting there instead of here.
		I finished up the reading assignment for the week, aside from the sections from the main course textbooks.
