		I finally found the &quot;add authorized user&quot; option in my credit union credit card&apos;s management interface.
		Unfortunately, it does demand the Social Security number of the authorized user.
		However, it asks for both the name of the user and, separately, the name to put on the card.
		I&apos;ve entered my legal name and Social Security number, then chose &quot;Alex Yst&quot; as the name to put on the card.
		Let&apos;s see if that gets approved.
		It&apos;s worth noting though that my request that my credit card be marked as lost still hasn&apos;t been processed.
		This request was made almost two years ago.
		Clearly, the people managing my card with the credit union don&apos;t respond in a timely manner, and this card request might not ever even get looked at.
		I had to go in in person to get the lost card situation rectified, and they of course wanted me to contact the support team that still hasn&apos;t responded, if I recall.
	</p>
	<p>
		I learned today that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Name_change#Usage_method">simply using a name makes it a legal name</a> in common law, as long as it isn&apos;t for fraudulent purposes.
		The newly-chosen name doesn&apos;t even need to be used as the only legal name that the person carries.
		That means that Alex Yst, Yst Dawson, and the name on my birth certificate are all legal names.
		However, getting ahold of documents to <strong>*prove*</strong> one&apos;s legal name change is difficult without first going through the court.
		I&apos;ll hold off on having my initial legal name stripped for a few more years to be sure that it&apos;s what I want to do.
		After all, I thought that Yst Dawson would be a good name for me, but I later changed to Alex Yst.
		I don&apos;t want to go to court multiple times over this.
		I&apos;ll drop my Yst Dawson name if Discover decides not to be trustworthy; that name continues to be bound to me by the credit card.
		I need to look into the laws that define common law legal names though, so I can more effectively defend the name Alex Yst until such a time that I decide to go through the court system to have it &quot;finalized&quot;.
	</p>

		I was far too tired today to take anything substantial home with me.
		I knew that I had to bring <strong>*something*</strong> though.
		My server?
		No, too heavy for today.
		A load of clothing?
		No, that would be a waste as I&apos;ll just bring my clothing when washing laundry.
		I tried to find a trash can and recycling can in my mother&apos;s stash of stuff that they&apos;re getting rid of, but no such luck.
		There&apos;s a bin of eating utensils, but it&apos;s also full of other things, and sorting them would be too much effort today.
		I ended up settling on my electric scalp hair razor and my electric facial hair razor.
		The facial hair razor is useless, it pulls at my skin and hurts.
		I&apos;ve got to use a hand razor instead.
		The scalp hair razor won&apos;t see use for quite some time.
		Still, both items will need to be taken home eventually, and both items fit in my bag for minimal transportation effort.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I got home, I took a quick look at the gratis item table in the laundry room.
		I took a bulletin board, a Wi-Fi router that was missing all of its cords, a book that contains a keyboarding course, and a book of health drink recipes.
		I didn&apos;t check all the recipes to see if they were actually potable, but at least one of them is free of animal products.
		I haven&apos;t looked beyond the one recipe yet though.
		I hung the bulletin board up on a wall that already had a nail poking out of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I of course headed to the post office with my paperwork again.
		The postal worker said that the locksmith is actually out changing the locks today!
		However, they were still changing the locks while I was at the post office, so the key wasn&apos;t at the post office yet.
		I asked if I should wait at the post office for the key, but the postal worker said that they had about fifty boxes to rekey and that I should wait at home.
		I was told that if they didn&apos;t deliver the key today (which I assume would be because they rekeyed my box before I got back), I should come back to the post office tomorrow; they&apos;re open from 10:00 to 12:00 tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hurried home as to not miss the locksmith, but there&apos;s nothing for me to do at home right now and I can&apos;t afford to waste the whole day.
		I tried to load my journal on my mobile, but my website seemed to be down at the time.
		My plan was to work on my reading assignment while I waited, but without the reading list in my journal, I couldn&apos;t do that.
		I had my limited FreedomPop <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card only, so I couldn&apos;t waste too much of my data transfer allowance by attempting to navigate the School website itself to find the reading list again, not to mention the fact that I was really in no mood to navigate Web pages that I don&apos;t know if are mobile friendly on my mobile today.
		Next, I tried to fill out some paperwork that the property managers gave me.
		They want me to report on the condition of the apartment.
		However, I quickly found that I have no pen at home.
		Again, I was stuck.
		I could eat lunch, but all that I have is a dirty frying pan and dry rice.
		I need to get some soap and scrubbers at some point.
		Finally, I decided to try on all of the clothing that got left on the gratis item table.
		That would pass a little time.
		About four items clearly wouldn&apos;t fit me, so I left them alone.
		Three pairs of pants did fit me, so I took them.
		The coat looked okay, anf it might have fit, but it contained wool, so I left it alone.
		There was a warm hat as well, but it didn&apos;t list the materials that it was built from, so I left it alone as well.
		Having gone through the clothing, I was out of things to do.
		This is almost done though; the end is in sight.
		I almost have the key so I can quit worrying about this record-purchasing deadline.
		I couldn&apos;t afford to waste more time, so I headed back to my mother&apos;s place to study.
	</p>
	<p>
		It feels like waste time is all that I did today though.
		Once I got to my mother&apos;s place, I bought and cooked lunch and bought dinner for cooking at work, then wrote up most of my journal entry for the day.
		I couldn&apos;t resist relaxing in the shower for longer than I should have, either.
		It helped me rest up a bit before heading in to work.
		I got almost no reading done today.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, one of my first customers insisted that they had preordered a meat lover pizza.
		I couldn&apos;t find the order ticket for it, but we keep three meat pizzas ready all day up until 20:00, so I said that I&apos;d just sell them one of those.
		They were very adamant though, insisting that they wanted a meat lover pizza, not a three meat pizza.
		I gave them the three meat pizza anyway and just called it a meat lover pizza for them.
		We don&apos;t sell any pizzas by that name, but it was obvious that the three meat is what they had to have tried to order.
		Another of my early customers came through the drive-through asking for chicken fries.
		I knew that they were just trying to play around by asking for things from another restaurant&apos;s menu (that of McDonald&apos;s), so I apologized and said that we discontinued that menu item.
		Next, they asked for fire sauce, which I&apos;m almost certain is a Taco Bell menu item.
		I later realized that I should have tried to sell them buffalo sauce, but instead, I said that that was a Wendy&apos;s menu item, not an item from our menu.
		At that point, they got serious and actually ordered something that we had.
		A group of customers came by asking about our vegan options.
		I explained that as a vegan, I wish that we actually <strong>*had*</strong> vegan options, but that all that we had on hand that vegans can eat is our cups of marinara.
		We could make a vegan pizza by leaving off the cheese and meat, but it&apos;d take some time for us to cook it.
		They didn&apos;t go for that though, and ordered a three meat pizza, the least-vegan thing on our menu.
		I guess that only part of their group (probably only one person) was vegan.
		One of my last seemed to be trying to get me to react by speaking in a strange voice.
		I can&apos;t be sure that they didn&apos;t have some mental condition or a speech impediment though, so I of course didn&apos;t react.
		Besides, I&apos;m very good at keeping a straight face.
		I&apos;ve been practicing so that I can better mess with people without them knowing I&apos;m doing it right away.
		In the end, they said that they&apos;d give me a tip in the form of a blown kiss.
		I thanked them and smiled, so they finally got the reaction that they were looking for, but I couldn&apos;t help but feel that it&apos;s rude to claim that that&apos;s a tip.

		I read two more of the assigned pages for <span title="Ethics and Social Responsibility">PHIL 1404</span>, one of which was the page with the case studies.
		It seems that Apple didn&apos;t know about their underage workers.
		That&apos;ll make it more difficult to defend the position that they <strong>*should*</strong> employ underage workers, as they didn&apos;t even do it on purpose, but I think that I can still argue both sides as required by the assignment.
