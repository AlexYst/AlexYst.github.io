<h2 id="general">General news</h2>
<p>
	I read through the <abbr title="GNU &quot;Free&quot; Documentation License">GFDL</abbr> so that I could make an effective case against it.
	The license is more of a mess than I thought.
	The limited freedom protections that it provides are easily bypassed (provided you aren&apos;t aiming for mass distribution), while the nonfree protections that it provides aren&apos;t bypassable at all.
	This is a horrid license.
</p>
<p>
	I cut up and ate that onion that I found the other day, soaking it in mixed fruit and vegetable juice before eating it.
	It was delicious.
</p>
<p>
	The snow is mostly gone from most of the roads and sidewalks.
	Hopefully this time, the snow will go away and stay gone instead of coming back in a few days.
	Business at work is starting to pick back up as well.
	We were still too slow, but I was able to stay an extra half hour instead of getting off way early, which is a good sign.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<h2 id="dreams">Dream journal</h2>
<h3>Dream 0</h3>
<p>
	I had a strange dream in which someone was chasing me down in an attempt to get me to marry them.
	I kept flying away, phasing through walls, and turning invisible, but they wouldn&apos;t leave me alone.
	They seemed to feel that if they could somehow catch me, I&apos;d agree to marriage.
	Of course, being an asexual aromantic, I had no interest in marriage, so marriage was never going to happen.
	At one point, they hurt themself jumping from a tree trying to reach me.
	I flew a bit close to make sure that they were okay, and it turned out that that was their plan all along.
	They said that it showed that I care about them.
	I explained that I did care about them, I just didn&apos;t love them in a marriage sort of way, as I&apos;m not capable of those sorts of feelings.
	That didn&apos;t convince them of the futility of their chase though, so it continued.
</p>
<h3>Dream 1</h3>
<p>
	I dreamed that Cyrus moved back in with us, and that they moved into my bedroom.
	They started moving my stuff around, and they plugged a telephone into the wall.
	I tried to explain, but they couldn&apos;t grasp the concept that because we don&apos;t pay for landline service, plugging a telephone into the wall isn&apos;t going to make the telephone function.
