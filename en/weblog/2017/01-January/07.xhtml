	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Ugh.
		It snowed again today.
		This time, the snow is deeper, and due to the freezing rain that followed, covered in a layer of solid ice.
		Almost no one wants to go out in this weather, so after heading in to work, I stayed clocked in for less than an hour.
		Normally, Saturday&apos;s one of our busier days, but today, we were too slow to even need a full crew.
		I was one of only five, so when I left, there were only four.
		Even morning crew has more than four people these days usually, and yet there wasn&apos;t even enough work to keep four people busy.
		It wouldn&apos;t surprise me at all if one or two more people got sent home soon after I did.
	</p>
	<p>
		I finished up a small essay on <a href="/en/opinion/holidays.xhtml">holidays</a> today, but I wasn&apos;t really feeling it.
		Most likely, I&apos;ll need to touch up this essay next time that I&apos;m feeling passionate about the idiocy of holidays and anniversaries.
		I then wrote up a short essay on <a href="/en/opinion/code_indentation.xhtml">code indentation</a>.
		I think that it needs work and needs more arguments, but it explains why I use tabs instead of spaces.
		I don&apos;t care if other people use spaces instead of tabs in their projects, but I&apos;m tired of people telling me to use spaces instead of tabs.
		When I ran the JavaScript that I wrote recently through a syntax checker, the stupid thing complained about my use of tabs instead of spaces.
		Really? I didn&apos;t ask for a commentary on my indention, I asked if my syntax was valid.
		I don&apos;t often write JavaScript, so I wasn&apos;t quite sure if I did it right.
		Furthermore, JavaScript is interpreted by the Web browser instead of compiled, so I wouldn&apos;t see the lovely compile-time errors and know to fix them.
		Next, I wrote up an essay on <a href="/en/opinion/free_software.xhtml">free software</a>.
		Again, I think that it needs to be touched up, but simply having the bare-bones essay up is a step forward.
		I can&apos;t add to my essay as I think of more details if I don&apos;t have an essay to add to, after all.
		As always, my essays are covered by the <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> <abbr title="General Public License version Three or later">GPLv3+</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started work on an essay about free culture and one about the <abbr title="GNU &quot;Free&quot; Documentation License">GFDL</abbr>, but neither is in a releasable state right now.
	</p>
	<p>
		For some reason, I got in my head that I needed to read <a href="https://en.wikisource.org./wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</a>, so that&apos;s what I did instead of finishing more essays.
		It&apos;s a lot shorter of a story than I&apos;d have thought, but as it was written so long ago, some of the language is slightly hard to follow.
		Only at the end do you actually learn about the connection between Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde; it&apos;s only at the end that the story is told from Jekyll&apos;s point of view.
		The story didn&apos;t go as I always assumed that it did, and the transformations weren&apos;t even voluntary any more by the time the story concluded.
		Scary.
		I certainly recommend reading it.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I succeeded in finding an apartment to live in.
		Alas, I had to wake and find that it wasn&apos;t real.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="apartment">
	<h2>Apartment hunting</h2>
	<p>
		The other day, one of my coworkers said that there is an apartment complex with openings available on the corner of Mohawk and E.
		I was about to head there today to check it out, but my mother says that that street corner doesn&apos;t have any apartments.
		My coworker had seemed a bit unsure of the details, so with the snow still coming down, I took it as an excuse to stay indoors and not check it out.
		Perhaps that&apos;s stupid on my part, as there&apos;s a chance that it&apos;s my mother that&apos;s wrong about what&apos;s at that location, but I just don&apos;t feel like walking in the snow for something that most likely isn&apos;t there.
