	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I took an old frying pan with me that my mother was getting rid of, and headed home with a bag of laundry.
		Unfortunately, along the way, the laundry bag ripped.
		I&apos;m going to have to find the time to repair it by next week.
		Unfortunately, the washing machines and dryers at my apartment cost to use.
		I had skimmed the directions the other day, and I didn&apos;t see anything about inserting coins, but sure enough, that&apos;s plain as day listed as a step.
		The washing machines were all in use though, so I left my laundry at home and headed to the post office to check on my mail key.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way out, I met my neighbors that live directly under me.
		Unfortunately, they&apos;re smokers.
		I was told that smoking isn&apos;t allowed on the premises, but here they were, smoking right outside their door and under mine.
		After I got back from the post office and had finished washing and drying my laundry, I met a couple more of my neighbors.
		They&apos;re also smokers.
		Again, they were smoking right outside their door, right where other residents are walking.
		The fine for smoking probably isn&apos;t actually enforced, which is disappointing.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the post office, I learned that every morning, the post office faxes the list of mail boxes that need to be rekeyed to a locksmith in Portland.
		Every week, the locksmith comes around to rekey all mailboxes that still need rekeying.
		However, they&apos;re not on a set schedule, so the postal workers can&apos;t tell me when my key will be ready.
		They simply don&apos;t have that information.
		That said, the postal worker that I spoke with said that they haven&apos;t seen the locksmith for a week to a week and a half.
		That worried me, as it seemed like they were taking longer than usual, but the postal worker explained that that is a good thing.
		It means that the locksmith is due to arrive any day!
		I&apos;ll try again tomorrow, which is my last day off before I have to go back to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Back at home, I found that one of the three washing machines was free, but the machines are too small to fit full loads in.
		I can only fit half a load.
		After about ten minutes, one of my neighbors came by and emptied another washing machine, so I got the other half of my load going as well.
		Each half-load costs $1.50 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		When my laundry was done washing, I then had to wait for the dryers, as all of those were taken as well.
		Again, they each only take half-loads.
		They also don&apos;t fully dry the clothing, so I had to put my laundry through four drying cycles.
		At $0.25 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per half-load per cycle, drying the full load cost $2 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>, bringing my laundry cost for the week to $5 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> for the week, plus soap.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, I need to carry my microwave oven that I&apos;m not even sure that I want home, as well as check once again on my mail key.
		I was planning on doing this later in the day, as to give the locksmith more time to perhaps give the key to the post office, but it turns out that I have school tomorrow.
		I&apos;ll need to go latish, but also a bit earlier as to make sure that I have time to rest before school.
		Maybe I&apos;ll just go early.
		My main goal I suppose is to deal with the microwave oven.
		The key isn&apos;t going to be there tomorrow anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<h3>Dream 0</h3>
	<p>
		I dreamed that my work schedule wasn&apos;t as expected this week; I had Sunday as one of my days off, but I always work on Sunday lately.
	</p>
	<h3>Dream 1</h3>
	<p>
		I dreamed that a former acquaintance from elementary/middle/high school came through the drive-through at work, asking if I recognized them.
		They wanted to be unrecognizable because they were going to make a scene at a party that night and didn&apos;t want to be remembered as the one that did it.
		They asked me to help obscure their identity, but I didn&apos;t know how.
		They already had a massive amount of strangely-colored hair, which was probably a wig, and a bizarre outfit.
		It still took me only a few seconds to figure out who they were, despite not having seen them in about a decade.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		Tomorrow at 21:05, I start courses at University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> again.
		I&apos;ve been anxious to get back to school, but with the whole mail key situation, I could use a bit more time.
		Oh, well.
		I&apos;ve already had more time than I was expecting.
		I need to check on the mail key again tomorrow, but after that, I may just need to give it time while I complete my <a href="https://y.st./en/coursework/">coursework</a>.
