	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I grabbed a pen and walked home, though this time, I didn&apos;t bring anything with me that I&apos;d be leaving.
		I&apos;m way too tired for now.
		It didn&apos;t help that I had a closing shift last night and that the post office would only be open for a couple hours before noon, so I didn&apos;t get a full night&apos;s sleep.
		Once home, I grabbed my paperwork in case I&apos;d need it and headed to the post office.
		I left my mother&apos;s place an hour before the post office opened, so I thought that I&apos;d get there about fifteen minutes before they opened, but the post office must be about half an hour from home.
		It took me a full hour to reach the post office, and I got there a minute after they opened.
		A full like had already formed in that time; others were probably waiting outside because of the short business day.
		They didn&apos;t have time to come after the doors had been open a while.
		Thankfully, the post office did have my key; three copies of it, actually.
		All three showed signs of corrosion on at least one side.
		I&apos;m not sure what that is about.
		I took the keys home and checked the mail box, both to make sure that the keys actually fit and to update my name in the box.
		Both of my known-at-the-time surnames were already in the box though.
		Juddy had followed through.
		I couldn&apos;t know at what point my names would be added to the box though, so without the key, I couldn&apos;t have ordered Marc&apos;s records yet anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried photographing the tops of the keys at home for my journal entry, but I messed up again.
		When I got the photographs back to my mother&apos;s place, I found that all of the clear photographs had been taken in the wrong orientation!
		I really wish that I could find a way to lock my mobile&apos;s camera in landscape mode.
		I <strong>*never*</strong> use portrait mode, and any time any of my photographs are in portrait mode, it&apos;s because I was photographing something from above and I slightly tilted the mobile in a way that was incorrectly interpreted as an indication that I wanted to switch to portrait mode.
		It always ruins my photographs at the worst of times and it&apos;s really getting old.
	</p>
	<p>
		I updated my address in Discover&apos;s records, then updated my credit card information on file with Bandcamp.
		Updating it with Bandcamp was for nothing though.
		I had forgotten that Bandcamp will only process payments for physical items through PayPal!
		Oh, scrap.
		Paypal.
		Discover said that they&apos;d block payments to PayPal Pro.
		Would this payment be through PayPal Pro?
		PayPal declined my card, but when I logged into the Discover website, I found that Discover was allowing the charged and that Paypal was just taking them back.
		Joy, PayPal is being a pain as always, but at least there&apos;s not a problem on Discover&apos;s end.
		Trying again, I found myself banned from the PayPal website.
		I had no doubt shifted to a new exit node, one that PayPal is particularly unfond of.
	</p>
	<p>
		PayPal also keeps claiming that I might have an account that is attached to the email address that I entered, and that I must log in.
		I never had an account with that email address though.
		PayPal supposedly closed the account that is associated with a different email address, but just to be sure, I tried logging in.
		GAH!
		The account is back!
		Also, PayPal now attached my payment email address to an existing account, probably using my credit card number, which makes me wonder how that even worked.
		I&apos;ve never used any credit card with my account!
		I don&apos;t have <strong>*time*</strong> for this garbage!
	</p>
	<p>
		Except that now I do have time.
		I explained the situation to <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/">Marc</a> and asked for an extension on the deadline, which they agreed to grant if the purchase came through at some point.
		PayPal hides their contact information though, so I had to take to Twitter again to publicly yell at them instead of handling this privately via email as I&apos;d have preferred to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		I installed a few new camera applications to see if I could find one that would allow me to lock the orientation.
		The one that I found to have this seemingly-basic feature that all camer applications should realistically have was Open Camera.
		Thankfully, it also offers the low-resolution option that I enjoy in the default camera, so this should work out well.
		Furthermore, this camera application can add the time and date to photographs automatically.
		It doesn&apos;t have the option to use dashes in the date instead of slashes, but at least it can be set to put the date elements in the correct order and can be set to use the twenty-four hour time format.
		It also add custom text of the user&apos;s choice to every photograph, so there&apos;s no longer a need for me to edit the photographs to add my <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> before uploading them.
		Lastly, with four new camera applications installed, the camera option showed up on my lock screen finally!
		It only allosed choosing one of three camera applications though, none of which were the default camera.
		Perhaps the reason that I couldn&apos;t access the camera from the lock screen, despite having configured the device to allow it, is that the default camera application on this device is somehow not considered to be a camera application.
		This is strange, as the version of the operating system that runs on the GT-i9300 instead of the GT-i9100 <strong>*does*</strong> allow the default camera application to be accessed from the lock screen.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I finished reading the <span title="Ethics and Social Responsibility">PHIL 1404</span> reading assignment, though I didn&apos;t have time to act on it today.
		Too many other things were going on.
		I must say though that I found the Aristotle piece from the reading list to be appalling.
		The style of writing made it difficult to read, being that it was from a different time period and we write differently these days, but it was very clear that Aristotle was advocating the subjugation of women and claiming that it was right and just to own slaves.
		The piece also was claiming that souls were proof of the relationship between master and slave being just, but I firmly disagree.
		For one thing, we have no proof that souls even exist; they&apos;re not proof of anything as we don&apos;t even have proof of them.
		That is to say, I can&apos;t claim that Bigfoot proof of something, as we don&apos;t have any evidence that Bigfoot is even real.
		For the sake of continuing this though, let&apos;s just substitute souls for brains.
		There&apos;s a difference between a brainless body being controlled by a brain and a slave with a mind of their own being controlled by a master.
		There&apos;s more in there that I&apos;d love to comment on, but I&apos;m simply out of time for today.
		I have to head in to work.
