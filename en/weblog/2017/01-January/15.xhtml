		Marc With a C has just released a vinyl addition of <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/linda-lovelace-for-president">Linda Lovelace For President</a> and a vinyl edition of <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/losing-salt">Losing Salt</a>.
		If you buy them before 2017-01-31, you also get two digital-only bonus albums.
		Not now, Marc! I&apos;m in the middle of preparing for a move to my own place! I&apos;m going to have to wait a bit to see how the apartment pans out and how mail delivery works there.
		If everything&apos;s fine, I&apos;ll order the records and have them sent to that address.
		Otherwise, I&apos;ll order them and have them sent to my mother&apos;s address and retrieve it from here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Marc&apos;s email said to order the two records and get two bonus albums.
		Each of the album pages say to order that specific record and get two bonus albums.
		Are there four bonus albums total? Or only two?
		Do I have a reason to order both records when I already have a digital copy of Losing Salt and I don&apos;t use a record player?
		Would it be rude to ask Marc, under the clear premise that I&apos;m wondering whether I need to get both or just one?
		Not that I&apos;d ever ask, but why are Marc&apos;s bonus albums only ever available with physical media (usually only with the vinyl edition, but sometimes available with <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr>s too) instead of the also available with the digital releases?
		I store the physical media in a box and never use them.
		Maybe I&apos;ll decorate my new apartment with them.
		After all, they&apos;re free art, right?

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I started again considering the possibility of trying to make the stories that I want to write fit in with an existing story universe.
		It might be better to use an existing story world rather than create one that fits the magic system that I want to use.
		After all, that would both draw attention to another free artist and would save me the trouble of planning all the things that I don&apos;t care about as much.
		I&apos;m finding myself to be indecisive with some of the basic planning details.
		The <a href="http://floraverse.com./">Floraverse</a> world has the major drawback of the frequency shifts (you&apos;ll know what I mean probably only if you&apos;re a reader), but other than that, it&apos;s got a lot of potential.
		Recent story updates have left me thinking that I can basically use the frequency shifts to my advantage for the one character that I wanted to create but that the frequency shifts would have been a problem for before.
		The <a href="https://peppercarrot.com/">Pepper&amp;Carrot</a> universe, known as Hereva, still seems too difficult to fit a specific one of my characters into though.
		Even ignoring the unmappable nature of Hereva, It&apos;d be vital that this character be a practitioner of Chaosa magic, possibly in addition to Zombia magic and Ah magic.
		A Zombia/Ah combination witch would be hard enough to form a back story for, but throw Chaosa into the mix, and you have an impossibility.
		Major damage was done to Hereva and the Great Tree.
		From this, we know that the Chaosa witches were in fact exterminated.
		There&apos;s no possibility of any hidden survivors that could be my character or be an ancestor of my character.
		Three Chaosa witches were resurrected, and they&apos;re training a single heir.
		This means that there are exactly four Chaosa witches, no more, no less.
		Chaosa magic is off-limits to any non-cannon character such as my own.
		I&apos;ll probably thumb through the Floraverse species reference pages and decide what to try to work with.
		Not every known specie has a reference sheet and, probably for plot reasons, we don&apos;t know much about these species.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my shift leaders, the one that likes to turn off the vents in the morning to try to keep warm, seemed to have some sort of cold aura about them today.
		It was really strange.
		I had my hands stuck in what is basically a freezer, meanwhile, they had been sitting in our pizza warmer to try to hold onto some heat.
		When they walked over to me though, they brought with them a cold chill in the air.
		How is that even possible? No wonder they&apos;re so cold all the time.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s worth noting though that since I mentioned to that shift leader that the rest of us have a right to not have to breath toxic fumes, they&apos;ve been very good about turning on the vents in the morning, at least when I&apos;ve been around to see.
		I think that maybe, they hadn&apos;t seen it from that perspective before.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my other shift leaders mentioned that I&apos;m agendered today.
		They know that? Already? I mean, I&apos;m barely starting to come to that realization myself.
		They&apos;ve known me for several years though, longer than this website&apos;s been around, so maybe I&apos;ve always showed signs of this but never really known myself.
		I&apos;m not sure that they know the word &quot;agendered&quot; though, and merely said that I probably didn&apos;t identify as either, which I confirmed.
	</p>

		My mother went and got replacement hoses for the washing machine, but it was no good.
		The washing machine itself is broken.
		It stopped agitating and now smells like something within is burning.
		After that, the machine stopped working entirely and won&apos;t turn on.
		Lovely.
		I wasn&apos;t banking on it working, I&apos;m going to have laundry machines at my apartment.
		My mother was counting on it working though.
		They&apos;ll have to come to my apartment to do laundry now.
		Without a washing machine here though, I washed another load of laundry by hand in preparation for the coming week.
		If I had more hangers with the little clips on them, I could wash more at a time, but for now, I can only dry five pairs of pants, five pairs of socks, <strong>*or*</strong> ten pairs of underwear at a time.
		I can still wash an unlimited number of shirts in any given load, but those other articles of clothing are a bit of a bottleneck for me.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother has offered to give me some essentials for my new home; specifically, pots, pans, and eating utensils.
		It sounds like they were offering to let me have some of even the ones that they had been planning to keep if they weren&apos;t too attached to them, but they also said that they&apos;re planning to get rid of a lot and I&apos;m welcome to anything that they&apos;re getting rid of without question.
		I&apos;ll stick with these things that they&apos;re already parting with.
		I&apos;m not super picky about it, and it&apos;ll be nice to save some money not having to buy these things.
	</p>
	<p>
		Google once again locked up my account.
		They&apos;re demanding telephone contact in order to unlock it.
		However, not having telephone contact is the <strong>*whole purpose*</strong> of the Google account, as I use it with Google Voice to translate incoming <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> and voice calls into emails that I can read instead.
		I&apos;m not sure what to do at this point.
		There&apos;s got to be a number that I can borrow to bypass this.
		Maybe I can get it to work from the telephone at work tomorrow ...

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I read a book about some green goo that moved around of its own accord.
		You had to store it in a film canister to prevent it from drying out and dying, but you could take it out for a while and it would move slightly.
		Somehow, though this was in theory only a story, I actually got to play with some of this goo.
		Cyrus, on the other hand, instead read the sequel, which was about some red goo.
		As such, they&apos;d somehow gotten a chance to play with the red goo.
		Cyrus was telling me about the story, before we traded books, giving away parts of the plot.
		It was a very good thing that the did, too.
		While the green goo was benign, the red goo was a parasite that would attach to your skin and take over your mind.
		I&apos;m not sure why Cyrus was giving me this warning, as they&apos;d fallen victim to the parasite themself; that is to say, it was the <strong>*parasite*</strong> that was warning me, using Cyrus as a vessel to do so.
		The parasite even explained some of the difficulties that it&apos;d initially had in spreading to other people.
		Some of the parasite ended up in a long, thin strand on the floor, and I quickly moved it to the sink and tried to wash it away before it could do any damage.
		However, it quickly grew, and kept coming up out the sides of the bowl of the sink.
		I kept knocking it back, but eventually, some of it somehow ended up on my back.
		I resisted, but it was very painful and difficult to do so.
		Without the parasite&apos;s warning, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to resist at all.
		I arched my back in pain and resistance to the parasite, but I couldn&apos;t get anyone to take a look and remove the thing.
		No one would believe that there even was a parasite.
