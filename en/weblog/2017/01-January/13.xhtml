		Glitchedpuppet seems to be stressing over money and has <a href="http://floraverse.com./comic/oneshots/566-workin/">asked people to purchase their works to help keep the comic going</a>.
		Physical items may be purchased in the <a href="https://store.floraverse.com./">Floraverse store</a>, while music from the video and interactive updates may be purchased on their <a href="https://floraverse.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp page</a>.
		I don&apos;t have a whole lot of money to spare right now, but I do want to help out, so I purchased <a href="https://floraverse.bandcamp.com/album/dissonant-dreams">Dissonant • Dreams</a>.

		I received an email from the Oregon Health Plan people telling me that they had a message for me, but that I had to log in to receive it.
		Ugh.
		I hate when people do that.
		Just send me the message in the email! In any case, their website is bugged up as usual, and it says that it has no messages for me.
		Instead, it simply presents me with the form to fill out.
		So I filled it out.
		Again.
		This is getting really old.
		I can&apos;t find any contact information on their website either, so I don&apos;t know how to let them know about the trouble I&apos;m having.
		The email that they sent me came from an unmanned outbox, so I can&apos;t even reply to that.
		At this point, I&apos;m kind of hoping that if I fill the form out enough times, someone will finally send me a message in person to find out what&apos;s going on, at which point I&apos;ll actually be able to reach someone.
		Their website is so broken.
	</p>

		I wasn&apos;t as productive today as I wanted to be.
		I didn&apos;t get enough sleep and my stomach felt strange.
		I did get a little done around the house though.
		Additionally, I brought my mother up to speed on everything about the apartment, at least as far as what I already know yet.
		I had a closing shift today, but I wasn&apos;t very eager to to go to work, so I didn&apos;t go in early as I normally do.
		Once I got going though, everything was fine as usual.
		Drive-through, closing shifts are about as easy as it gets.
