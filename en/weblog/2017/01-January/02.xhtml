	<p>
		You can see the snow in the mountains from near my home now.
		Hopefully the snow won&apos;t reach us here in the valley.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way to work, I found an onion.
		That was kind of amusing.
		I&apos;ll probably cut it up and soak it in lemon or tomato juice, then eat it.

	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I was off exploring with a friend and we came across a place that I&apos;d been before, but the friend hadn&apos;t.
		The friend noticed my name scribbled on some of the walls thinking that I&apos;d done it, but I explained that I was actually hated by this tribe of people, and on this list of names of their enemies that they keep, I appear in both the first and sixth slots.
		I warned my friend to be careful of the millions of small thorns in the area, thorns meticulously attached to all surfaces by the tribe.
		Later, after we left, I realized that I&apos;d been poked by one of the thorns, and only then did I remember the true horror of what the thorns were: they were coted in a poison left by the tribe, a poison that induces a permanent and incurable madness.
		I began jumping back and forward in time to past moments of the dream randomly, and I kept trying to fix the problem.
		However, it was too late.
		I was only perceiving the time jumps; it was a symptom of the madness and I knew it.
		Whatever was really happening at the moment, I was no longer experiencing the present and I never would again.
		My body would be acting out what I was trying to do in reaction to the time jumps that were all in my head.
		At the end of the dream, I started jumping between the bodies of two people sitting in a car.
		I couldn&apos;t make it stop, and at last, the madness was enough to wake me up, back to the real world, where none of that had happened.

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve updated my degree plan slightly, as well as added all expected elective choices to the headers of my coursework pages.
		All forty courses that I&apos;ll be taking are now known, though there&apos;s a chance that some may change before I take them.
