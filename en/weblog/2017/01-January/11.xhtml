		Lorenzo&apos;s Music is asking people to remix three of their songs for use on their upcoming album! If I had any idea how to work with sound files, I&apos;d love to participate myself, but it simply isn&apos;t an option right now.
		Perhaps I will have an opportunity to send in submissions for a different album if this one goes well enough and Lorenzo&apos;s Music decides to do this again.
		If you&apos;re a fan of free culture music and you think that you have what it takes to pull off some sweet remixes, <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com./2017/01/call-out-for-remixers.html">give it a try</a>!

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I found a dream journal entry that I wrote up, but foolishly forgot to include in my actual journal.
		I now have no idea what day that it&apos;s from:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			I dreamed that I was working the drive-through window at work and someone came through needing an ambulance.
			Come to think of it though, they&apos;re already driving a car, so that makes no sense.
			In any case, I made the call for them, at which point I had to act as a communication bridge between the person at the menu board and the person at the emergency call center.
			The person at the emergency call center was asking stupid, irrelevant question&apos;s about the victim&apos;s operating system, which I didn&apos;t have the answers to.
			I should have relayed those questions, but they caught me off guard so I simply replied that I had no way to know.
		</p>
	</blockquote>

		My mother revealed how Cyrus really &quot;ruined Christmas&quot; for my mother now.
		It has nothing to do with the fact that Cyrus was claiming things about standard Boy Scout project procedures that were clearly lies.
		The problem is that Cyrus went to spend time with our father, so now our mother &quot;has to&quot; find a way to leave Cyrus out of family Christmas.
		In other words, Christmas is &quot;ruined&quot; because my mother is being vindictive and trying to prevent Cyrus from having a relationship with both parents.
		Because Cyrus won&apos;t choose a parent, our mother is doing the only thing that they can that will result in Cyrus not having a relationship with both parents; our mother is cutting ties with their child.
		Additionally, our mother is claiming that <strong>*all*</strong> aspects of Vanessa&apos;s life relate to our mother, and therefore, our mother should get to run Vanessa&apos;s live for them.
		Wow.
		Our mother is such a control freak.

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	I awoke in the middle of the night again, resulting in two remembered dreams.
	<h3>Dream 0</h3>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I was scrubbing powdered cleanser out of a shower, but it was in huge lumps and every time that I went back to a spot, the lumps there were back.
		It was a real pain.
		I didn&apos;t even put any of the cleanser there.
		It had all been caked there from when someone else had attempted to clean the shower and did a lousy job.
	</p>
	<h3>Dream 1</h3>
	<p>
		I dreamed of scrambling to catch up with forgotten coursework and also of a grape vine with funny-shaped grapes: regular grapes, cubic grapes, and a couple of more complex shapes that wouldn&apos;t even be possible if the fruit were grown in molds.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I mostly completed my response to the university, but they want me to describe myself and describe the school.
		Both will take further thought.
		I have until partway through Saturday to finalize my response though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="apartment">
	<h2>Apartment hunting</h2>
	<p>
		The property manager still hadn&apos;t telephoned back, so I telephoned them again.
		this time, they were actually in, but I guess that they don&apos;t check their answering machine or something, as they seemed completely clueless that I&apos;d left a message yesterday morning.
		In any case, water, sewage, and garbage services are all included as part of the rent.
		That&apos;ll save me a lot of money! Electricity, however, is not.
		Electricity is said to run about $60 to $70 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per month.
		The property manager only accepts payment in the form of cashier&apos;s cheques or money orders.
		There are laundry facilities on the premises, but not in the individual units.
		That means that not only will I not have to bring in a washing machine and dryer as I would at some complexes, but also that the washing machines and dryers that they have aren&apos;t tied specifically to me.
		If they break down for some reason, I won&apos;t specifically be blamed for it.
		Additionally, the units come supplied with a refrigerator, a stove (probably with an oven), and a dishwasher.
		I don&apos;t plan to own enough dishes to even be able to run a full load at once, so I won&apos;t be using the dishwasher; it&apos;d be overkill.
		I might use the refrigerator, but I haven&apos;t decided yet.
		I suppose it&apos;ll depend on what sort of food I end up deciding to keep on hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have to bring by my security deposit, which is the cost of one month&apos;s rent, tomorrow.
		At that point, I&apos;ll fill out some paperwork to put the unit on reservation until it&apos;s ready for me to move in.
		That way, someone else doesn&apos;t snatch up the unit in the mean time.
		If I decide not to move in though, the deposit is non-refundable.
		Hopefully, nothing will prevent me from moving in.
		I can&apos;t fill out the paperwork and provide my deposit on the premises though, it seems.
		I have to instead take it to 525 Harlow Road tomorrow at 11:00.
		When it&apos;s almost time to move into the apartment, I&apos;ll need to provide my first month&apos;s rent as well as a $25 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> fee to cover a credit check.
	</p>
	<p>
		The property manager told me that their main office was just down the street from the rental property.
		I&apos;m not overly familiar with Harlow Road area, so I kind of made an assumption as to where it was based on being down the street from the complex.
		I needed to time the walk there so I&apos;d know when to leave my mother&apos;s house tomorrow.
		I checked in with First Tech Federal Credit Union on the way to see if they offered cashier&apos;s cheques or money orders, thinking that cashier&apos;s cheques would be the most likely to be there.
		Sure enough, they have them, and they don&apos;t charge members for them.
		Sweet! So picking up a cashier&apos;s cheque will be one more errand to run every month, but it won&apos;t cost me any extra money, effectively increasing the price of rent.
		Furthermore, First Tech is only a slight detour on the trip from my workplace to my new home, so it won&apos;t take much extra time.
		I&apos;m unsure of the terms of the lease, but I need to have the cashier&apos;s cheque on hand when I go in if I agree to it, but if I don&apos;t agree to it, I don&apos;t want to be out $520 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> for nothing.
		I asked the teller if I can return the cheque if I don&apos;t use it tomorrow, and sure enough, I can, so I picked that up and continued my walk.
		The rain started to come down though, and not wanting to risk the cheque, I headed home to drop it off and restarted my trip.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got lost on my way there, and as it turned out, I headed in the entirely wrong direction the first time and on my second trip.
		I ended up asking a fellow random pedestrian for directions.
		My timing of the trip there was obviously useless, so I timed the trip back, and found it to take about thirty-five minutes.
		I was more tired on the way back, so I probably walked slower, but it&apos;s better to err on the high end than the low end to make sure that I get there on time.
		I&apos;ll likely try to leave an hour before I need to be there to show that I am very much interested and am not going to flake out on this.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I don&apos;t have a home Internet connection, and I likely won&apos;t, I won&apos;t be updating my journal nightly like I&apos;ve been doing.
		I&apos;ll still write my nightly entries, but I won&apos;t have them uploaded right away.
		I might have to wait until the next day when I can get to the public library.
		The library isn&apos;t open every day either, so there will be delays on those days, as well as days that I don&apos;t have time to make it to the library.
		I was considering switching to weekly updates instead of daily updates, but I still have my coursework that I need to do.
		I&apos;ll need to pay frequent visits to the library, even if not daily.
		I&apos;m a bit nervous about the move, but at the same time, I&apos;m highly relieved.
		I can do this.
		I will escape.
		I can be free.
		I would have tried to get the paperwork signed and deposit in today, but I feared that my mother might freak out if I didn&apos;t tell them before making any irreversible commitments.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother says that I still need to help with their move.
		I&apos;m more than happy to comply.
		Simply being able to walk out the door at a moment&apos;s notice and have a place to go will be a big weight off my mind.
		I will likely change my mailing address and move most of my belongings as soon as I can, but I&apos;ll sleep here at my mother&apos;s house to maximize time that I can work on the house.
		If my mother wants my help, they&apos;re going to have to be reasonable as well.
		As I said, I&apos;ll be able to walk out, so they won&apos;t be able to threaten to kick me out any longer.
		My mother wants me to get a couch at my new place.
		I don&apos;t think that I want a couch though, it&apos;s too difficult to get home.
		My mother assumes that they can drive the couch to my place, but the fossil fuels burnt in the process wouldn&apos;t be worth having a couch for.
		I&apos;ve also offered to allow my mother to use part of my apartment as temporary storage for some of their belongings.
		It&apos;s going to be a bit unpleasant having a room full of boxes; I&apos;d like to be able to escape my mother&apos;s mess, not bring it with me.
		However, it was very much my idea, not something that my mother insisted upon, and I&apos;d like to be of some help if I can.
		My mother brought up a couple more questions that I should ask the property managers.
		If I leave the place clean when I move out, do I get my full security deposit back? Also, is the lease a yearly contract or is it a month-to-month deal? I&apos;d love if it were a month-to-month deal, that would give me more freedom, but I&apos;m assuming that it&apos;s a yearly contract.
		Lastly, my mother says that if they move to Portland, I should come with.
		I really don&apos;t want to leave Springfield, but they bring up some good points.
		What if I somehow lose my job? What if something terrible happens with the apartment somehow and I lose that? If my mother was nearby, I would at least have someone that could help me out until I get back on my feet.
		I&apos;m trying to escape, but at the same time, it&apos;s not safe to escape too far just yet.
