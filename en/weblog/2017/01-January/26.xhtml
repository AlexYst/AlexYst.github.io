	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t get as much reading as I should have done, but honestly, I&apos;m tired.
		I should have more energy once I have the mail key and can stop my frequent walks home.
		Other than assigned reading, I just went to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, one customer asked for a pepperoni pizza, then after I sold it to them, they asked for an additional cheese pizza.
		I agreed to sell it to them, but upon hearing that it cost the same as the pepperoni pizza, they decided not to get it.
		It seemed almost as if they thought that I&apos;d give them the pizza gratis, though t could be that they thought that the price would be lower.
		Another customer told me &quot;I&apos;ll take an order of bread sticks, but you can keep your weird sauce.&quot;.
		Normally, the bread sticks come with marinara.
		So ... marinara is weird?
		They also bought two pizzas though, both of which had the same &quot;weird sauce&quot; on them.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my coworkers has pinkeye.
		Before I knew what it was, I rubbed my eyes at one point.
		Did I touch something that they had beforehand?
		I really hope not.
		For the rest of the day, though the area around my left eye was a bit itchy, I was too afraid to do anything about it.
		To make matters worse, they were holding a sopping rag up to their eye frequently, and the rad was dripping everywhere.
		If its one of the infectious types of pinkeye, that was sure to spread the infectious agents.
		Later in the day, that same coworker confided in me that the head manager usually isn&apos;t very nice to them.
		However, lately, the head manager has been being nicer, and my coworker is interpreting it as an attempt to prevent them from quitting.
		My coworker doesn&apos;t care though, and says that tonight might be the last day working there before they quit, if the other job that they&apos;re looking into works out.
		They won&apos;t even put in their two weeks notice.
		I&apos;d keep this to myself instead of writing it here, but by the time that anyone from my workplace ever reads this, which will probably never happen anyway, the departure will have already happened.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, I will go check on my mail key again.
		I really don&apos;t want to do that, but I&apos;m running out of time.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that cans and bottles with deposits, such as soda bottles, could no longer be returned by private citizens to get back the deposits.
		Instead, the cans and bottles had to be taken to schools, where one would give them to a particular classroom.
		The school kept the money, of course.
		The classroom that collectively brought in the most cans and bottles got a prize of the teacher&apos;s choosing though.
		I was back in high school, and my class had somehow won this, despite it being the first day of school.
		The prize that the teacher had chosen was that the class could use this wireless charger base station for the day.
		The charger would send power out invisibly through the air to special cords designed to use the wireless charger, and the cords would be plugged into devices.
		My charger wasn&apos;t wireless though, unlike the chargers of the rest of the class.
		I asked if I could plug my charger directly into the base station, and explained that my charger couldn&apos;t work wirelessly.
		The teacher wouldn&apos;t allow it, so as lame as I thought that our prize was, I couldn&apos;t even have a part of it.
		We then went to our seats and put on virtual reality headsets, but someone wouldn&apos;t get out of my seat.
		After a frustrating few minutes, and after sitting in a free seat that wasn&apos;t my own, I remembered that we hadn&apos;t chosen seats for class yet.
		A memory had been dislodged, and was attaching itself to the wrong point in time.
		I had been in that seat in a previous class that I&apos;d taken in that room!
		I explained what had happened, calling it a flashback, and apologized to the person that I&apos;d mistakingly tried to evict from their chosen seat.
		They said that they&apos;d hold me to the fact that I have flashbacks if I ever denied it, so I corrected myself, saying that it was more of a memory attaching to the wrong point in time than an actual flashback.

	<p>
		The school sent me a letter asking for me to participate in an online event as part of the ambassador program.
		This event is hosted using a platform that requires use of Adobe Flash to use though.
		I responded as such:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			I&apos;d really love to attend, but the Shindig of shindig.com (as opposed to Apache Shindig) requires Adobe Flash to use.
			It&apos;s a barrier to entry that prevents me from connecting to the meeting room, no matter how much I&apos;d like to.
			I don&apos;t have Adobe Flash installed, nor can I install it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sorry,<br/>
			~ <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>

		I read the first half of the reading assignment, taking some notes to help with my essay.
		I can&apos;t really start on the essay proper until I get to the part that includes the case study involving Apple.
		In my essay, I&apos;ll have to argue both for and against Apple on the same topic.
		The topic is of Apple&apos;s use of child labor.
		That&apos;s right, I&apos;m required to argue <strong>*in favor*</strong> of both Apple and child labor.
		I&apos;ve found the tool to do so already though, so I can pull it off.
		I don&apos;t need to make the argument into one that people will buy into, I just need to make it fit with what we&apos;re being taught.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of what we&apos;re learning, one thing that the reading assignment is covering is metaethics.
		That is, arguments about ethics and about how to define ways of measuring ethics.
		As I&apos;ve been trying to tell someone I know, there&apos;s no one way to do it.
		One of the assigned pages for reading mentions four major views on how to measure something as ethical or unethical.
		Another mentions a few more, including the skeptical view, which is the one that I hold and the one that I&apos;ve tried to explain.
		Put simply, I don&apos;t thing that there&apos;s any real, absolute, and canonical (for lack of a better word) way to measure ethics.
		I have my views on what should happen and I try to uphold them.
		But you probably have different views, as you&apos;re a different person.
		Which of us is right?
		Both of us.
		Ethics are specific to the individual, and there&apos;s no &quot;correct&quot; version of ethics.
		Another key point that is made in the readings is that ethics, unlike other methods of decision-making, is based on arguments.
		However, arguments are based on facts, viewpoints, and opinions.
		Viewpoints and opinions differ from person to person, which again, means that ethics differ from person to person.
	</p>
	<p>
		One final note, and it&apos;s the one that I&apos;m going to use to support Apple, is that one view on ethics is that it is a measure on how well one fulfills one&apos;s purpose.
		A corporation&apos;s only purpose is to make money.
		That means that whatever Apple does to exploit people, it&apos;s the ethical thing to do as long as it turns a profit for shareholders.
		Personally, I think that this is an incredibly ugly view of the world, but it&apos;s the argument that&apos;s going to allow me to pass my assignment.
		Not only that, but I need to argue both for and against Apple anyway in the assignment, so I&apos;ll have plenty of room to bash Apple like they deserve.
