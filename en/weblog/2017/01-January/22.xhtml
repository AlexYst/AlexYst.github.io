	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I was going to take my file box to work today, then bring it home after work.
		However, it was raining just before I left for work, so I almost left the file box at my mother&apos;s place to avoid getting my files wet.
		Right before I left though, the rain cleared up and the clouds began to dissipate.
		It was a bit of a risk, as the clouds could easily be back by the time work ended, not to mention that it could even rain again on the way to work, but I took the file box with me as originally planned.
		Once I got off work, I took it home.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I neared my door, I noticed a small note taped to it.
		Several things flashed through my mind.
		Was it a note saying that my mail key was ready?
		No, the post office said that they&apos;d only try to tell me in person, and if I missed it, I&apos;d need to come in person to check for the key.
		Was it a note from the on-site manager, telling me that my stuff wasn&apos;t supposed to be in there?
		The key box on my doorknob is still there, so perhaps the on-site manager hadn&apos;t quite realized that I am in fact supposed to live there now.
		Reading the note though, I found that it was actually about the filing cabinet that I&apos;d been offered a couple of days ago.
		It&apos;s a good thing that I decided to bring the file box home after all, as I otherwise wouldn&apos;t have seen the note yet!
		Had it been there yesterday though?
		And how did they know which apartment I live in?
		They said that they are in apartment fourteen though.
		Apartment fourteen is the one that the on-site manager lives in though, or so I thought.
		Given this note, I figured that the &quot;14&quot; by the door must mean something else and that there must be an apartment fourteen elsewhere.
		Looking around though, I&apos;m apartment thirteen on the end.
		Next to me is twelve, not fourteen.
		On the next building over, the numbers start with the on-site manager&apos;s home at fourteen and go up, with the next being fifteen.
		There&apos;s nowhere else for unit fourteen to be.
		I rang the bell, asking the on-site manager to make sure that that was apartment fourteen, and it certainly was.
		I asked about the filing cabinet note, and the person that offered me the cabinet came out from deeper in the apartment.
		The person offering me the filing cabinet was the older person that seems to live with the on-site manager!
		No wonder they knew where to find me.
		Somehow, I didn&apos;t recognize them when we met in the laundry room, and thought that they were another paying tenant.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way to the file cabinet, they offered me a television, but I explained that I don&apos;t have service.
		They said that it was the kind with the good rabbit ears, which I assume means that it picks up the few stations broadcast over the air still that don&apos;t require a subscription, so I clarified that I don&apos;t watch television.
		They also gave me a backpack, which will come in handy because I wear my backpacks out pretty badly and need to replace them.
		They also offered to lend me a dolly to move the cabinet, but being small and nearly empty (it has a few empty folders in it, it was pretty light weight.
		I just carried it, as that seemed easier (unless I was to have to move it much further than I did).
	</p>
	<p>
		They asked if there was anything else that I needed, but I wouldn&apos;t even know what to ask for.
		I did say that I needed the mail key, but I also said that I&apos;d have to wait for the post office on that one, making sure that they didn&apos;t think that I thought that they could provide me one.
		They said that speaking of the mail key, they needed to get my surname to tell the mail carrier so that the mail carrier would deliver my mail.
		I told them my legal surname, but also Dawson, telling them that I sometimes receive mail under my &quot;pen name&quot;.
		Does that mean that I can now purchase Marc&apos;s record(s)?
		Would that be safe?
		Would the name Dawson make it into the mail box before it came time for the records to arrive?
		I can&apos;t be sure.
		I&apos;ll have to continue waiting for the key before I make the purchase.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was at work, I was thinking about the Floraverse character that I&apos;m planning to create.
		I came to two conclusions.
		First, I think that I want my character to be part rabbat.
		Rabbats tend to each be able to hear some inaudible thing.
		For example, one rabbat might be able to hear the value of different metals.
		At first, I thought that I&apos;d use this quirk to make a character that could hear upcoming frequency shifts, allowing them to take evasive action.
		They&apos;d be a scientist of some sort, and have invented some tool (probably in the form of high-tech, clawed gloves) that would allow them to burrow out of the dying frequency and into the new frequency.
		But how would my character have even learned what an upcoming frequency shift sounds like?
		The first time that one hit my character, they&apos;d have no idea what they were hearing.
		After the shift though, the old version of my character would have been erased.
		The new version of my character wouldn&apos;t have experienced a frequency shift.
		There&apos;d be no way to learn, so no way to use that power.
		Using it for anything would thus be a plot hole.
		However, I did find a more interesting and practical thing that they could hear, and something that could make them a more enigmatic character.
		No one knows what they hear, aside from them and I, but it will shape how they behave.
		That said though, rabbat hearing is diminished as the character has less rabbat genetics.
		A pure rabbat doesn&apos;t have certain characteristics that I&apos;m looking for, but an impure rabbat&apos;s hearing might not be as useful as I&apos;d want it to be.
		It might not be worth throwing rabbat genetics into my character at all.
		That is, unless I choose to go with a rabbat demon.
		There are two problems with non-imp demons though.
		First, they can&apos;t breed, which means that I have to pick one species and stick with it.
		I can&apos;t get a hybrid.
		Second, there&apos;s no information yet on where non-imp demons even come from.
		I couldn&apos;t even come up with a back story for my character at any point.
		Second, I think that I found a plot hole in the Itchy Itchy arc of Floraverse&apos;s cannon.
		The Itchy Itchy plague only affects demons, not topsiders.
		This is important for the cleanup of the island, as topsiders are brought in because of their immunity.
		However, the first two victims are both topsiders.
		How could that even happen?

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that we had four cats in the house, two of which were actual cats that we&apos;ve had.
		For some reason though, we lived in one of the houses that I haven&apos;t lived in in years.
		Two of the cats escaped the house, so I was sent out to retrieve them.
		The two that escaped were Frances and an orange cat that doesn&apos;t exist in the real world, and one of the cats that stayed inside was Cleo, the cat that my father probably killed in the real world.
		Vanessa was surprised to learn that we kept Cleo in the house though, as Cleo used to be an outdoor cat.
		After catching the cats and putting them back inside (it wasn&apos;t difficult and didn&apos;t take long, both cats were very nervous about being outside), I went back outside, where I met a new cat that I hadn&apos;t seen before.
		Normally, I don&apos;t touch strange cats, but I grabbed this one and pulled it onto my lap, to the cat&apos;s surprise.
		The cat had huge front paws and acted like it was going to claw me for grabbing it, but it never did.
		It just touched my face with its claws and threatened (nonverbally) to claw me.
		I released the cat almost right away, but it stayed on my lap for a couple more minutes before leaving.
		I started talking to the cat, and it responded in English, but it was a bit nervous about answering questions.
		The one thing that I did learn was that its name was Molie.
		At least, that&apos;s how I&apos;d have spelled the name.
		It was pronounced sort of like &quot;Mo Lee&quot;, but as one word.
