	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I should&apos;ve gotten a lot more coursework done today, but I didn&apos;t.
		I was too busy enjoying being me.
		It was a good day, and I get the feeling there&apos;s going to be a lot of good days ahead.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems <a href="/en/domains/morgan.local.xhtml"><code>morgan</code></a> has slowed down.
		Previously, it was faster at compiling my website than <a href="/en/domains/newdawn.local.xhtml"><code>newdawn</code></a> was, completing the task in about half the time.
		Now, it completes it in about the same amount of time as <code>newdawn</code>.
		Additionally, it seems <code>morgan</code>, unlike any laptop I&apos;ve had in ages, is able to go to sleep and wake up without issues.
		I can start actually sleeping my laptop when not in use!
	</p>
	<p>
		Someone that prefers to remain unnamed was asking about my website, but I had no answers as to time frame.
		I think Ellenor overheard, as we now moved to the next step.
		We now have a test page!
		Because of the structure of my website though, a subdirectory of a website can&apos;t play proper host to my pages.
		My pages use absolute paths, not relative paths.
		This is a feature, not a bug, and I don&apos;t plan to change it.
		However, I do plan to get at least some of my non-journal pages up in a modified form when time allows.
		The other thing worth noting is that files named <code>index.xhtml</code> are not treated by the server as index pages.
		The index pages will need to be renamed <code>index.html</code>.
		I&apos;d already considered the possibility of this, and started planning a command line option for my build script that will allow the index file name to be specified at build time.
		I don&apos;t have time to work on this today though.
		I&apos;m also going to need to find a way to account for the fact that with the wrong file extension, the Web server is sending the wrong <code>Content-Type</code> header.
		It causes the pages to display as blank.
		<del>I might experiment with frames to try to combat this.</del>
		<ins>Never mind.
		It seems the server&apos;s running Apache and the <code>.htaccess</code> file is enabled.
		Score!
		A one-liner in that file cleans up the entire mess.</ins>
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="mental">
	<h2>Mental health watch</h2>
	<p>
		I spent the day smiling and laughing about what I am.
		There were even some tears of joy on occasion.
		It seems I&apos;ve come to the point that I not only accept myself for what I am, but also <strong>*embrace*</strong> it.
		I can be me and I can love being me.
		Every fibre of my being is gay!
		I&apos;ve always been gay.
		How could I have never noticed?
		I guess between the wretched living conditions and the lack of information I had, I can&apos;t really be blamed for not knowing, but it all seems so obvious in retrospect.
		This is what I am and this is what I want to be.
		I never want to become sane if it means giving this up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of sanity, I think the time has come to stop discussing it.
		It&apos;s obvious to me now that I&apos;m not losing my lucidity as I feared I would.
		I&apos;m still aware that I&apos;m utterly insane, and now, I&apos;m loving it.
		My descent into madness is complete.
		Let a new chapter of my story begin, an era of enjoyment of life and an era of lunacy!
