		It seems the ink cartridges weren&apos;t the right type for my printer after all.
		There&apos;s the model name, but also a sub-model number, that didn&apos;t match.
		Why do companies reuse their model names for incompatible devices!?
	</p>
	<p>
		I went to see a movie today at an event held by the public library.
		I was bored of it quite quickly, but the movie dragged on.
		It seemed to have no real plot, and just followed someone that&apos;d gotten shot as they slowly died and tried to outrun those that pursued them.
		In the end, I guess they escaped, but only moments later, they died from their gunshot wounds.
		I guess I thought there&apos;s be some sort of socialising afterwards or something, but of course there wasn&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		I forgot to mention before that I recommended the library &quot;bingo&quot; challenge to Vanessa and our mother, so I have that marked off my list as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the movie, I found a surprise.
		Someone had stolen the back light off my bicycle.
		Not both lights, just the one.
		Some people are crazy.
		Honestly though, I should&apos;ve been detaching them and bringing them with me every time, but I&apos;ve gotten really lazy about it as of late.
		It&apos;s amazing they weren&apos;t stolen months ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Mental health watch</h2>
	<p>
		With my affliction under control (not gone, but managed), I was able to sort out the feelings I&apos;d been having in a more-logical way.
		I&apos;ve been seeing certain men and certain women attractive.
		However, when I think of genitals, I feel an aversion to vaginas and a draw towards penises.
		Additionally (and I don&apos;t think I mentioned it directly in my journal when it was happening), in the beginning, I imagined myself in a pair with a woman, just entering the sexual stage of the relationship.
		However, there was always some issue.
		My penis wouldn&apos;t become erect, I wouldn&apos;t be able to stand the feeling of the vagina, or some other such scenario.
		I&apos;d always end up having to apologise, then either do the work manually or put on a strap-on over my actual, limp penis.
		However, when I fantasise about men, it&apos;s always something positive.
		Successful sex, cuddling on the couch, cooking dinner together ... all sorts of things.
		So what does this all mean?
		I think I might be biromantic, capable of a romantic relationship with someone of either sex.
		However, I&apos;m full-blown homosexual, not a half-repressed bisexual as I&apos;d feared.
		This is all speculation, and I still don&apos;t know exactly what I am, but it makes sense to me.
		If I want a relationship that involves sex (and annoyingly, that&apos;s what part of my brain is begging for), I&apos;m going to need to stick with men.
