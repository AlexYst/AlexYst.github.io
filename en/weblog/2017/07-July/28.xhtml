		I brought my shift leader in need two hundred-dollar bills, but it looks like they only needed $120 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		They found the other $30 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> elsewhere.
		They didn&apos;t have enough change though, so took $140 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
	</p>

		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Mental health watch</h2>
	<p>
		Today at work, I was level-headed, not overly emotional.
		Lexi seems to be emotional all the time, be it happy or depressed.
		In other words, I wasn&apos;t Lexi.
		I also wasn&apos;t overly cold though, like Xander.
		Furthermore, I noticed this one cute guy in the lobby.
		Xander doesn&apos;t seem drawn to anyone he doesn&apos;t know.
		I think I&apos;ve successfully merged my halves.
		That was easier and quicker than I thought, and I haven&apos;t even worked out all those two&apos;s issues yet.
		Come to think of it, I don&apos;t think I fixed <strong>*any*</strong> of their issues.
		I guess I just had to stop tearing myself apart about what I am and stop holding my two halves apart.
		I hate being weak enough to need a partner, but that&apos;s what I am, and I&apos;m doing my best to accept that.
		I hate being shallow enough to rule out half the population as potential partners based on what&apos;s in their pants, but I&apos;m doing my best to accept that as well.

		I tried to get a proctor for my courses next term from the local library, but apparently that&apos;s <a href="http://wheremindsgrow.org/proctor.html">not a service they offer any more</a>.
		So it sounds like it&apos;s something they <strong>*used*</strong> to do.
		They recommended I try at one of the local collages, which supposedly offer that service for a fee.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t feel like I have time to deal with this.
		I&apos;m already dealing with my emotional issues and fractured psyche.
		I&apos;ve got coursework and my day job.
		I&apos;m preparing for the festival.
		I want to start looking for a better day job soon.
		If I could put off finding a proctor or if I could find a proctor in town (the colleges are in the next town over), I&apos;d proctor this term.
		Instead, I guess I&apos;ll put of proctoring yet another term.
		This is absolutely the last term I can put it off though.
		After that, I run out of necessary courses that don&apos;t require proctors.
		Y&apos;know what?
		Never mind.
		I&apos;m going to make this work; I&apos;ll bike to Eugene on Monday if I have to and try to get a proctor at the university.
		First, I sent an email to the school today to see about getting a proctor.
		I don&apos;t seem to be able to find any information on when the coming term starts though.
