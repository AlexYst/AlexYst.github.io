	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		There was a particular street intersection I knew yesterday I needed to get to to reach Game Farm Road, where my dentists&apos; office is located.
		Two streets cross, and both streets change street names for some reason right at the intersection.
		It seems I was mistaken as to which street became Game Farm Road, and the street I was thinking of was Harlow Road, but the street I needed was there none the less.
		The sign for the dentists&apos; office is even visible from the intersection.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I got there, I found the building still under construction.
		Had the representative at the Trillium office given me the wrong address the other day?
		As I looked in the windows, it was pretty obvious they weren&apos;t open for business, but I decided to circle around the place just to be sure before giving up.
		Maybe only half the building was out, and the other half was seeing patients during a building expansion.
		As it turns out, there&apos;s a second building behind the first, and that building is fully operational.
	</p>
	<p>
		The receptionist asked if I&apos;d had any trouble locating the place, so I explained about the under-construction building and how I&apos;d thought the sign for the dentists&apos; office belonged with that building.
		I&apos;d thought the dentists&apos; office was still under construction.
		They explained that the sign actually <strong>*does*</strong> belong with the other building, and that the other building is going to be used for certain types of patients.
		They had me fill out some paperwork asking for my email address, but there was a miscommunication between us.
		I write my &quot;a&quot;s the way you see them in most computer fonts.
		Lots of people write a fancy, loopy, digit &quot;2&quot; that way, so they thought the user component of my email address was <code>2lex</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		They were actually able to get me in for a new-patient appointment a lot sooner than I thought they would.
		My appointment is on 2017-11-15 at 07:00; a little over a week away.

	<h2>Mental health watch</h2>
	<p>
		Today at work, I noticed a bit more of my sanity slipping.
		I&apos;m not comfortable talking about the specifics at this time, but I do need to keep an eye on this.
		I&apos;m crazy, and that&apos;s fine because I&apos;m not dangerous.
		If this particular strain of new insanity is allowed to take hold though, I could be a problem.
