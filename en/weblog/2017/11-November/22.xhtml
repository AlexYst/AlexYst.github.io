	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the loan company charged me interest on my borrowed money between the time I told them to take the money I owe out of my credit union account and the time they actually took it.
		As a result, the last of my loans isn&apos;t paid off, and I still own them one cent.
		They say I have until 2024-02-23 to pay it off.
		The thought of owing one cent to them for several years is completely absurd.
		Like, what even is the point?
		First, they shouldn&apos;t be charging interest after I told them to take my money, but if they&apos;re going to, why didn&apos;t they nullify that one cent once the payment went through?
		It&apos;s probably going to cost them more than the one cent they&apos;ll get from me just to take that one cent from my account.
		Whatever though.
		Their problem, not mine.
		I&apos;ve told them today to take that one cent from my account, so this time, hopefully I&apos;ll actually be done with this company soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had a very stupid and rude customer today.
		They ordered a menu item that we don&apos;t keep ready due to low sales.
		If we kept it ready in case someone ordered it, we&apos;d need to throw out way too many of them each day because they&apos;d expire before being sold.
		I explained that there&apos;d be a five to seven minute wait on that menu item, and they wanted it anyway, so I put their order under their name and asked them to come back in five to seven minutes.
		In stead of leaving, they wanted to stay right where they were.
		To be clear, I was working the drive-through lane; they thought they could hold up the entire line for five to seven minutes during the dinner rush.
		I told them again that they&apos;d need to come back, and explained that they can&apos;t block the drive-through lane for that long, so they left.
		They came back quite a bit later, complaining that they&apos;d waited twenty minutes, and asked for a gratis drink as compensation.
		I explained that we can&apos;t do that, they pushed and restated that they&apos;d waited way too long due to the huge line of vehicles.
		I explained that if they didn&apos;t want to wait so long, they could have come into the lobby where they&apos;d&apos;ve gotten it as soon as their order was complete, and that the long line isn&apos;t our fault.
		They ordered a menu item that we don&apos;t keep ready during the busy period of a very busy day (the day before a big feasting holiday is busy because no one wants to cook that day) and didn&apos;t want to bother to leave their vehicle.
		I&apos;m not authorised to give out gratis drinks, and if I was, I certainly wouldn&apos;t give them out just because someone was being a lazy idiot.
		Of course, I explained it in much less detail and without any of the negativity.
		I simply stated that they could&apos;ve come into the lobby and that it&apos;s not our fault that the drive-through line was so long; we don&apos;t give out gratis drinks.
		They started trying to make me feel bad out of anger over something I couldn&apos;t help, and said they bet I get paid quite a bit.
		Yeah, I work minimum wage for the time being.
		They actually succeeded in bringing me down for about five minutes, but then I regained control.
		I put myself in a state of forced happiness just to not let them have that power over me, but it didn&apos;t stay forced for long.
		I returned to a state of real contentment that was actually better than before I dealt with that customer.
		That customer&apos;s own life must suck pretty badly if they have to lash out at a stranger to make themself feel better.
		Either that, or they have zero self-control.
		As sucky as my life is right now, I&apos;d rather be me than them any day.
	</p>

		I was finally able to perform my test that I meant to two days ago, and my gayness is certainly <strong>*not*</strong> back.
		Drats.
		I think I&apos;m at about the state I was in after having escaped my mother&apos;s home but before finding my inner gayness.
		It&apos;s a good place to be in, but I want my gayness back for reasons I&apos;d not mention here.
		I think this shows I&apos;ve made great progress in accepting my own gayness, too.
		I thought I&apos;d finally accepted it before, but pretty soon, I found myself wondering why <strong>*I*</strong> have to be gay.
		That&apos;s not really self-acceptance.
		Now, I want it back.
		I don&apos;t seem to have it any more, and I want it back.
		I&apos;m almost sure that this return to having no sexuality is temporary, so it&apos;s good that I want to return to what I likely will return to whether I like it or not anyway.
		Hopefully this time, I&apos;ll appreciate my gayness more.
