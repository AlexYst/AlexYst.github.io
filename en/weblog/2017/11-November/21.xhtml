<section id="general">
	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		The garbage disposal that my apartment supposedly doesn&apos;t have got jammed today.
		Using a fork to rummage through the drain, I found the only thing jamming it was a chunk of potato.
		Seriously?
		A potato chunk can jam the thing?
		It seems to me like the motor doesn&apos;t have much force to it or something.
	</p>
	<p>
		The potato chunk <strong>*was*</strong> a bit large though.
		When I cut up that potato for soup, I found large bad spots in it, as well as strange cavities that I dared not eat.
		I&apos;m not sure what was up with the thing, but I salvaged what I thought I could and got rid of the rest.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure why, but one and only one of the three washing machines in the laundry room now costs fifty cents less to use.
		I usually put off doing laundry until I can&apos;t reasonably fit all my dirty clothing into one load, but I&apos;m going to need to quit doing that.
		By doing laundry more often, I can save some money.
