	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		It seems I won&apos;t be getting eyeglasses in the near future after all.
		The eye exam itself is too expensive, even ignoring the cost of the physical glasses.
		Including the cost of the glasses, I&apos;d have to drop over a hundred dollars, and I&apos;m not comfortable doing that right now.
		I&apos;ll just have to continue with my poor vision for the time being.
	</p>
	<p>
		My coworker asked me late again to cover the end of their shift.
		I really wasn&apos;t feeling up to it, but I agreed to do it.
		I always agree to cover shifts.
		No matter who asks me, if I don&apos;t have another obligation, I do it, no matter how tired I am.
		I started trying to reason with myself; talk myself into telling them &quot;no&quot;.
		I matter too, don&apos;t I?
		If I&apos;m not scheduled to be there and I don&apos;t want to be there, I shouldn&apos;t have to be.
		I&apos;m out of debt now, I can afford to turn down extra hours.
		I almost had it, too.
		I almost told them I couldn&apos;t take the extra hours on after all.
		But then I remembered; they&apos;re them.
		They&apos;re caring, they understand the impact they have on others, and they pick up the small details in how others prefer to be treated.
		Well, at least they pick up some of the important details other miss, even if they themself can&apos;t pick up everything; small, yet obvious signals that others blatantly ignore.
		With a single utterance, they made me feel valid, like my vision of myself mattered.
		Anyone else, I think I could&apos;ve worked myself up to turn down.
		But not them.
		Within reason, I want to be there when they need it.
		Covering the end of a shift is nothing.
		The funny thing is that I don&apos;t think they thought much of what they said before.
		They likely don&apos;t even remember saying it, and if they did remember, they wouldn&apos;t know how much it meant to me.
		They probably never even knew I overheard them say it.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed Vivian and I found a strange room full of computers and monitors.
		A couple of strange, tall structures were in the room, though I don&apos;t quite recall their shape.
		At their peaks were monitors.
		The structures rocked and swayed rhythmically, allowing the attached monitors at the top to face several directions.
		Vivian and I touched nothing, but tried to observe what was going on so we could figure out what the room was for.
		After a while, the monitors on top of the structures began displaying text reporting that two individuals in the room were behaving strangely.
		It was some sort of security system!
		Vivian and I panicked.
		She said we needed to shut all the security system computers (which was most, but not all of the computers in the room) down.
		I replied that we just needed to get out of there before any sort of alarm was triggered.
		She didn&apos;t listen, and began shutting off the machines.
		I waited a few seconds for her to come, but when I saw she wasn&apos;t going to see reason, I began shutting computers down as quickly as I could too.
		I didn&apos;t want to leave her behind.
		I started out shutting them down the right way, but quickly switched to just holding the power buttons down until they turned off.
		Due to the varied shapes and models of the machines, I accidentally turned one of the monitors off instead of a computer, so I turned that back on so when I shut the computer itself off, I could verify the monitor still went blank, so the machine had shut down.
		We finished up, and Vivian started messing with one of the non-security computers, but an employee of the place came in about then.
		They didn&apos;t seem to be there because of us; they didn&apos;t appear particularly worried, so I doubt they&apos;d received any sort of alert.
		They just sort of wandered in, like they&apos;d just gotten off break and had come back in because this was their station.
		They&apos;d notice the state of the machines soon though.
		I wasn&apos;t going to stick around to see what they said about all the shut down security computers.
		I tried to get Vivian to leave again, but when she wouldn&apos;t, I left alone.

	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
