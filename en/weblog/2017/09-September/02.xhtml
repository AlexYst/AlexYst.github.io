	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		School is about to start again soon, so I went to visit my mother while I still had time to do so.
		I set a two-hour timer though so I wouldn&apos;t have to stay all day.
		I&apos;ve got other things to do.
		She wasn&apos;t feeling well though, so two hours was plenty of time.
	</p>
	<p>
		A new wave of despair over my debt hit me today.
		Slowly but surely, I&apos;m climbing out of debt.
		This is a fact that cannot be denied.
		It&apos;s going to take forever for me to be rid of this debt though, and with it, the horrid loan company that the government sold my debt to.
		For the most part, I try not to worry about it, but every once in a while, I look at the dollar amount remaining and just sit in shock about how much&apos;s still left.
		I&apos;ve decided to try a new challenge to save money and get me out of debt faster.
		It&apos;ll still take forever, but hopefully not quite as long.
		I&apos;m going to continue paying my rent out of my pay cheques, but other than that, I&apos;m going to try to live off my tips from work.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rules of this little game are simple, but to reduce the change of ambiguity, thorough.
		I have essentially two funds.
		I have my cheque fund and my living fund.
		Any payment I have to make by cashier&apos;s check, which is currently my rent and my tuition, will come from the cheque fund.
		That means I don&apos;t have to magically make $520+ <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> in tips each month to keep my home and I don&apos;t have to make $200+ <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> every few months to stay in school.
		Additionally, any payments to the loan company will come from this fund.
		All money I receive from cheques, which is currently just my pay cheque, will go directly to this fund.
		To avoid the ambiguity of any money I had prior to today, all money I had prior to today also goes into this fund, meaning that my living fund started at zero today.
		All other expenses come from my living fund.
		Among other things, this includes my electricity bill, my grocery bill, and the quarters I need for doing laundry.
		Any money I make outside of cheques is deposited to this fund.
		Mostly, this is the tips I make working the drive-though at work, but it also includes any money I make returning bottles from my coworkers for deposit and any coins I find on the ground.
		The longer I can keep this up, the sooner I should be debt-free.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have some things going for me.
		Anything I already have stashed at home doesn&apos;t count against my living fund.
		For example, I have a pantry full of canned vegetables.
		I may need to buy things to cook <strong>*with*</strong> the vegetables, but I won&apos;t have to buy vegetables for quite a while.
		I have things working against me though too.
		Customers used to sometimes give me tips from their credit cards.
		With the new system at work, that&apos;s no longer an option.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of the new system that nobody; even the owner of the store; wants, the thing continued to utterly fail today.
		We were once again having to both enter information into the computers <strong>*and*</strong> write out hard copies of it so it wouldn&apos;t get lost.
		I&apos;m all for digital systems, honestly.
		However, this particular digital system is so poorly designed that it doesn&apos;t function and doesn&apos;t allow the people who need access to the data to actually see what&apos;s going on.
		Without these paper tickets, the same ones we were using before the new system was put in place, our orders would be lost and our customers would start getting mad.
		We basically have two parallel systems in place now, an outdated one that still works as good as ever and a computerised one that doesn&apos;t even function.
		This redundancy adds to our workload with zero benefit and slows us down.
		... well, I guess there&apos;s not <strong>*zero*</strong> benefit, but there&apos;s zero benefit for those it&apos;s <strong>*supposed*</strong> to benefit.
		For me, it keeps me busy at the register longer.
		I work as best I can, but this redundancy keeps me from getting the work done in the back room I need to.
		I&apos;m making the same amount of money either way, but someone else that would otherwise be sent home early is being kept later to clean up the back room.
		They&apos;re getting more hours and making more money, while the franchise owner loses money from this.
		It works for me, but the new system is an obstacle, not a functional tool.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<p>
		I set up the beginnings of a comment parser.
		It&apos;s a simple class for extracting generic information form a documentation comment without any understanding of what is being extracted.
		Tags and tagged information are treated differently than the main body paragraphs of the comment, but no tag is given any special treatment and any tag someone comes up with will work, provided the tag name doesn&apos;t contain spaces.
		When I have time, I can use this to start building the code that&apos;ll actually examine the source files and build documentation.
