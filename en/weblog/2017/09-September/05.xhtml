	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		While I was running errands today, I decided to reclaim my old Bi-Mart membership.
		I bought a new one after the name change, but I still paid for the old one, so I might as well keep it.
		My mother got wiggy about my trips to check the lucky number when I lived with her, and Cyrus lost his card.
		I ended up giving my card to Cyrus, so he could claim my prizes.
		He soon lost that card too though, so no one had my card.
		Now that I don&apos;t have to deal with my wiggy mother though, I&apos;ve been checking the lucky number almost weekly, and I might as well check the numbers for both memberships.
	</p>
	<p>
		After completing the library challenge, I was awarded thirteen tickets to put toward twenty-five or so raffle prizes.
		To increase my chances of winning, I chose a prize that looked like it wouldn&apos;t be one of the popular ones, and I put all my tickets toward it.
		Avoiding the popular-looking prizes wasn&apos;t too hard, either.
		There was a tablet running a proprietary system.
		That seemed like it&apos;d be in demand, but what would <strong>*I*</strong> do with it?
		There were also books still under copyright and gift certificates for things I never buy.
		I forget what all the prizes were, but I went with something that looked like it was either an art set or a sticky note set.
		It seems it was a sticky note set, it came with a mug, and I won it.
		I&apos;ve got to pick it up at the library tomorrow when I get back from Eugene, but before I head to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the pride festival, an insurance agent has been pestering me.
		It wouldn&apos;t be an issue if they had any sense whatsoever, but they don&apos;t seem to.
		Four times now, they&apos;ve emailed me asking me to telephone them for a quote.
		To the first three, I responded that I don&apos;t have telephone service and that if they want to give me a quote, I&apos;m happy to hear it over email or another non-telephone communication channel.
		Today, I received their fourth request that I telephone them.
		I&apos;m getting rather ticked off.
		I&apos;ll head into Eugene tomorrow to tell them off and see if they&apos;ll see reason.
		They either need to give me the stupid quote without a telephone call or they need to stop pestering me.
	</p>
	<p>
		The child (or was it grandchild?) of the on-site manager&apos;s mother (the on-site manager&apos;s sibling or child?) gave me a couch the no longer want.
		The fabric&apos;s a bit worn, but it&apos;s made of cloth.
		A while back, I found an old, abandoned, leather couch with a sign telling anyone that wanted it to take it.
		I was desperate to have somewhere, anywhere, to sit, so I hauled it back to my place on foot.
		Later, my mother gave me a couple of cloth couches, but I&apos;m still under the impression she might want them back at some point, so I kept the leather couch as a backup.
		Now, I can finally be rid of that gross thing.
		I haven&apos;t used it in ages, as sitting on dead skin grosses me out.
		I&apos;ve hauled it out to my porch, though I&apos;ll have to wait to haul it downstairs.
		I need to get to sleep tonight so I can get to Eugene early.
		I need to get back early-ish so I can pick up my prize at the library at the time I committed to.
