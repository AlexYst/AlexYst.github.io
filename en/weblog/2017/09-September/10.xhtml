		My mother wants me to come over and help her clean her house so she can get it on the market.
		I&apos;ll try to squeeze the first part of that in on Wednesday.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other day, I dreamed that my ostensibly feminine coworker was a transwoman, but I wasn&apos;t entirely sure she actually identifies as feminine in the real world.
		You never can tell unless you ask or it comes up.
		Well, it came up and she is indeed feminine.
		Someone online assumed she was a dude, as she put it, and she was a little put off that someone&apos;d assumed her gender.
		I replied that most people assume I&apos;m a dude too, and she laughed.
		She didn&apos;t think I was serious!
		So I explained that there&apos;s a difference between sex and gender, and that while my sex is male, my gender&apos;s something between man and woman.
		Most people don&apos;t seem to understand the difference between sex and gender, though at least one of my other coworkers sort of gets it.
		They refuse to use the correct terminology, but they do put the emphasis on what people are on the inside, not the outside.
		They use the word &quot;sex&quot; as a synonym for the word &quot;gender&quot;, but at least they don&apos;t use the word &quot;gender&quot; as a synonym for the word &quot;sex&quot;.

		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

		I dreamed I was at work, matching up the hand-written order tickets with their redundant, printed counterparts.
