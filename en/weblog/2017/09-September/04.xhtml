	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t have much time to look into oil pulling before midnight last night because I get home so late (I close the store).
		Reading more in-depth, it looks like oil pulling isn&apos;t actually worth trying so much.
		It&apos;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_pulling#Effectiveness"><q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_pulling#Effectiveness">poor substitute for oral care</q></a> and is <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_pulling#Effectiveness">probably not as effective as standard mouth wash</q>.
		So what I need is standard mouth wash; not that that&apos;ll save my teeth.
		I inherited bad teeth from my mother and there&apos;s nothing I can really do about that.
		The mouth wash might clean things up a bit though and lessen the pain until I can have my broken teeth removed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, the pain in my teeth was minimal.
		In fact, I only really noticed it when I was looking for it.
		That said, my energy level was also minimal, so I got next to nothing done.
		I did try to go out and run errands, but today&apos;s a holiday, so the businesses I needed to visit were closed.
		I could get stuff done out and about if it weren&apos;t for the holiday, but at home, I just wasn&apos;t feeling it.
		I ended up taking a nap about midday.
	</p>
	<p>
		I considered spending the day outside reading, but there&apos;ve been too many fires lately.
		The air is filled with a haze I&apos;d rather not breathe.
		I can&apos;t even keep my bedroom cool by opening the window without the stuff coming in; the smell is pretty strong.
		While I was on my way back from trying to run errands, I found one of the fire locations: a neighbouring apartment complex.
		Seriously, the only things separating that complex from mine are a a street and half a park; it&apos;s real nearby.
		Hopefully the same thing doesn&apos;t happen here as well.

		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I had a dream in which I was hanging out with Cyrus, Vivian, and our mother.
		I think I was over at my mother&apos;s place visiting, but it&apos;s hard to say, as the building we were in doesn&apos;t look like my mother&apos;s actual house.
		She asked me via email while I was in the other room if I could come visit relatives for a few days in a few days.
		I explained that no, I had school and work and such.
		She said I should give her more warning if I can&apos;t come, so I explained I had no idea she was going to ask me.
		<strong>*She*</strong> needs to give <strong>*me*</strong> more warning if she wants me to leave town for a few days, so I can get time off work, cram for school, et cetera.
		That&apos;s so like her too, even in the real world.
		She thinks I can just drop everything at a moment&apos;s notice and she won&apos;t tell me of plans until the last minute when it&apos;s too late.
		I got no response to my last letter, and when I next saw her in person, she made no mention of her upcoming trip.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, I saw a room set up with probably at least five Christmas trees, all decked out, along with other Christmas decorations.
		It must&apos;ve been the holiday season, though I wasn&apos;t aware of it until I saw my mother&apos;s decorated room.
	</p>
	<p>
		We left for somewhere, and while we were out, Cyrus pulled my keyhole choker out of his bag and put it on the dirty ground.
		I scooped it up protectively, and told him he shouldn&apos;t be taking my choker outside my home.
		Why did he even <strong>*have*</strong> it?
		That was a mess though.
		My mother saw it, and insisted it must belong to my neighbour.
		The part of my neighbour was played in this dream by one of my friends and coworkers.
		She wears a lot of chokers, as my mother pointed out, and she probably removed it at my place.
		My mother insisted that I must be having sex with her and that she stripped it off along with the rest of her clothes, then forgot it.
		I tried to explain that wasn&apos;t the case, and that the choker was mine, but my mother wouldn&apos;t listen.
		We have some things in common, but I would never sleep with her.
		I was also a bit annoyed that my mother thought I lost my virginity, but I tried not to put up too much of a fight; otherwise, she&apos;d take it as a sign she was right and I was trying to cover it up.
		In other words, I had no way to win.
		I asked Vivian for her opinion on who she thought the choker belonged to once our mother left the room (we were back in the house at this point), but she gave a strange analogy that basically was supposed to mean she wasn&apos;t taking sides.
		The analogy didn&apos;t actually have any relevance to the situation though, and when I pointed that out, she didn&apos;t know what to say.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was relieved when I woke up though.
		I remembered I&apos;m gay; I don&apos;t have to deal with this crap.
		I guess this is one of those &quot;thank Squiddy I&apos;m gay&quot; moments.
		I have some girly things, but if my mother insists they belong to an actual female, she won&apos;t be thinking it&apos;s someone I&apos;ve been sleeping with.
		And if she believes something could honestly belong to a male, there&apos;s no reason not to believe me when I say it&apos;s mine.

	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
