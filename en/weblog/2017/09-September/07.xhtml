	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I ended up having to work with the rotten food today at the community services building, so that was pretty gross.
		Someone had to do it though.
		After that, I was trained to work the hydrolic hand truck.
		It&apos;s pretty simple to operate, but difficult to steer.
		For some reason, I was again the only volunteer today though.
	</p>
	<p>
		A thunderstorm started up right as I was about to head out to work.
		With my bike out of commission because of the bad tire, I couldn&apos;t just zip through the rain, and I ended up working in wet socks all day.
		Joy.
		When I got home, I found a note by my door telling me to go to Eugene the day after tomorrow for gratis shoes, as my neighbours are worried about the poor condition of the ones I have.
		The timing couldn&apos;t be worse.
		School&apos;s started back up today.
		My bike&apos;s out of commission because of the bad back tire.
		I didn&apos;t get off work and find the note until it was too late to get the inner tube I need.
		Cyrus is coming for a visit tomorrow.
		If I skip the shoe thing, my neighbours will think I&apos;m ungrateful.
		Ugh.
		There&apos;s nothing I can do; I&apos;ve got to make all this work.
		I&apos;ve emailed the community service centre representatives and let them know I&apos;ll have to quit volunteering at least until the term ends.
		I simply can&apos;t commit to that, as these types of last-minute issues regularly pop up.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems my mother&apos;s become a minister now.
		I&apos;m not sure what my future fiancé (if I ever meet the right person) will think, but it&apos;s worth considering my mother for the job of marrying us if there aren&apos;t any issues.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
