	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve finished emptying my living room.
		I&apos;ll drop off the key with my mother tomorrow, and tell her the one rule I&apos;ve settled on: no dry goods!
		She sent over a couple of boxes of breakfast cereal not too long ago, from her moth-infested home, and now my place is infested.
		Now I&apos;m trying to starve them out.
		Even today, I found another moth, but at least I haven&apos;t seen any of their maggot-looking larvae lately.
		I&apos;m hoping there&apos;s no reproduction going on, and that once I&apos;ve cleared out the existing adult moths, my problem will be over.
		I&apos;d planned to have two other rules here, but I&apos;ve eliminated the need for them.
		First, don&apos;t store stuff in my bedroom.
		I&apos;ve locked the door now though, so that won&apos;t be an issue.
		And second, if you use my laundry quarters and you insist on paying me back, don&apos;t pay me in quarters.
		My mother doesn&apos;t seem to grasp the concept that I don&apos;t want quarters and feel I have too many.
		I&apos;ve moved the quarters out of reach though, so there won&apos;t be any borrowing of them and no need to pay me back.
		Problem solved.
		The dry goods issue is the only thing I can&apos;t enforce while I&apos;m away, and thus is the only actual rule that needs to be in place.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I was planning to get a lot of coursework done today, but things didn&apos;t go as planned.
		My main task for today was to complete some interactive Web lessons on <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, but the website kept failing on me.
		It used bogus amounts of JavaScript, being that it was an interactive Web application.
		I don&apos;t know what was going on with the back end, but it kept failing to grade the submissions, and I&apos;d have to wait several minutes to an hour to move on to the next lesson.
		With the long wait times, I kept getting distracted and doing other things.
