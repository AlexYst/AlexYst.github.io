	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Early this morning, I found I wasn&apos;t able to enter the laundry room.
		The lock on the door was busted, so I couldn&apos;t even fully insert my key.
		I worried about how long I&apos;d need to go without washing laundry, as it&apos;s been a while since my last load, but the lock was fixed later in the day.
		Everything&apos;s cool.
	</p>
	<p>
		It took much less time to get to the insurance office than I&apos;d feared, though round trip, I had to refill my back tire three times.
		It&apos;s a good thing I brought my bike pump, because I usually don&apos;t.
		It seems though that the insurance agent hasn&apos;t been ignoring me, or so they claim.
		My emails aren&apos;t reaching them.
		Whatever screwy system they&apos;re using is dropping my letters.
		(Or more likely, sending them to the spam directory, despite them being responses to emails sent out by (ostensibly) the same system.)
		Their renters&apos; insurance isn&apos;t going to work out though.
		It seems they <strong>*only*</strong> allow the filing of claims via telephone.
		That effectively quadruples the cost of their insurance, as one must additionally pay for telephone service.
		Not to mention that I despise the demand many companies make that everything be handled via telephone.
		I have telephone service now, to be honest, but on principle, I always tell companies I don&apos;t and I refuse to telephone them.
		And by the time I need to file a claim, I might not have telephone service any longer.
	</p>
	<p>
		I stopped by the public school district office to try to update my name in their records.
		It seems I can&apos;t do that though.
		Darn.
		No matter though.
		Once I&apos;ve got a college degree, I&apos;ll probably never need to touch my high school transcripts or other public school records again.
	</p>
	<p>
		I picked up my reading challenge raffle prize today.
		The sticky note set&apos;s a lot nicer than I have any idea what to do with.
		It&apos;ll probably be decades before I run out of sticky notes though, as I go years at a time without using any.
		Maybe I should give them to Vivian, who uses sticky notes frequently.
		Then again, the front edge of the set is rainbowed because of the slits through witch the coloured notes show through.
		Maybe it belongs with me after all.
		The note set came with a 2017 calendar, which at first, I scoffed at.
		The year&apos;s almost through, so the calendar won&apos;t be good much longer.
		It turns out it&apos;s reversible though, and the other side&apos;s for 2018.
	</p>

		My gayness seems not to have fully revealed itself to me just yet.
		My sexual desires seem to be evolving and changing.
		For part of the day, I contemplated one of my two new desires, and after a bit, I though it might be my key to becoming a bisexual.
		This time, I&apos;d try to convert more slowly; give my brain time to adjust.
		But that was when I remembered the second urge, which is completely gay.
		My original gay urges aren&apos;t likely gone either, just inactive at the moment.
		I also still have zero interest in vaginas, so I&apos;m still very much gay.
		That hasn&apos;t changed, and I shouldn&apos;t try anything stupid that&apos;ll result in mental damage again.
		I do wonder how my gayness will manifest as time progresses though.
		I&apos;m also starting to wonder if my gayness (homosexuality) comes pairs with gayness (happiness).
		I has in a very chipper mood today.
		Either gayness could easily be influencing the other.
		As I become happier and more relaxed, my mind may be loosening up and taking on it&apos;s true form more fully.
		In that case, the happier I get, the more homosexual I&apos;ll get until I reach my true level of gayness, then it&apos;ll just stop there.
		On the other hand, as I said, my increased gayness is likely due to an increased ability to be myself.
		So in that case, the more I&apos;m able to be the true me, the happier I&apos;ll likely be.
		There might even be a feedback loop where both aid in increasing the other.
		I guess it doesn&apos;t matter though, as both are likely to continue increasing for the foreseeable future.

	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
