	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Last night after I&apos;d completed my journal entry, I found that none of tha various screws the on-site manager&apos;s parent gave me fit the new doorknob.
		The screws from the old doorknob didn&apos;t fit either.
		It was late though, so the regular hardware stores weren&apos;t open.
		I needed to know I&apos;d be safe though, so I biked to a 24/7 department store.
		I&apos;m not proud, that store&apos;s a known villain of the business world, but I ficured giving them less than a dollar for screws shouldn&apos;t cause too much harm and I don&apos;t have time to dawdle; this is urgent.
		They didn&apos;t have the screws I needed though.
		They had ones too large and ones too small, but no Goldilocks screws.
		I&apos;d have to wait until morning and hit up the hardware store.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I arrived back home, past midnight, I found my laptop&apos;d frozen on me.
		I forced it to power down, then I powered it back up.
		It refused to even reach the stage of boot where you see the <abbr title="Basic Input/Output System">BIOS</abbr> screen though.
		I waited, tried again, tried swapping hard drives, tried removing the battery, and I forget what else.
		It still wouldn&apos;t function though.
		I did find though that when I had my usual hard drive in, the screen would stay lit, but black, no matter how long I left the maching powered on after trying to boot it.
		However, if either of two other hard drives were inserted instead, the screen would glow black at first, but eventually stop emitting light at all.
		Something&apos;s different with this one hard drive even pre-boot.
		Odd.
		I powered off the machine and went to bed.
		When I woke up, the machine still wouldn&apos;t boot.
		I feared it might not, but I&apos;d hoped the longer cool-down period would make it work better.
		I had no time to get a new machine today though, that&apos;d have to wait until tomorrow.
		The locking doorknob was less important, but more urgent.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the hardware store, they didn&apos;t have the screws I needed either.
		They said they could order them and it wouldn&apos;t cost much (they didn&apos;t give a price).
		I asked how long it&apos;d take though, and they told it&apos;d take at least a week.
		I don&apos;t have that kind of time, so I ended up needing to buy a new doorknob after all.
		And here&apos;s the annoying part: it turns out some locking doorknobs don&apos;t have that metal plate on the edge of the door in their design.
		I&apos;d started chiselling away at the door already, and now, it seems I shouldn&apos;t&apos;ve done that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Last night, in desperation, I utterly destroyed the latching mechanism of the door.
		It just wouldn&apos;t come out!
		But then the ostensibly-glued part still wouldn&apos;t come out.
		I eventually wiggled it loose only to find it hadn&apos;t been glued at all.
		It was just a poor doorknob design.
		It wasn&apos;t designed to be replaceable or removable.
		It was built with a grooved grip that gets pounded into the wood, never to come out again.
		The new doorknob has that same poor design, but now, the hole in the door is looser.
		Next time, the knob should come loose without too much fuss.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the doorknob in place and fearing I didn&apos;t have time to get to the recycling centre in the next city over and still get home in time for work, I decided to try to see what a computer repair store could do for me.
		I&apos;m guessing they&apos;ll charge too much for me to afford a repair, especially on a machine as old as mine, but without my computer, I was useless.
		I had nothing to do with my time besides try.
		I tried booting up the machine again though, and now it worked.
		Crisis averted for now, but <a href="/en/domains/morgan.local.xhtml"><code>morgan</code></a> had still threatened to give up the ghost.
		It was a warning, and I knew I needed to get a new machine soon.
		As I wrote up the summary of the morning&apos;s events though, a strange, blue glitch streak showed up across the width of the monitor.
		Even as I typed, <code>morgan</code> was showing signs of dying!
		It went away though, and I continued writing.
		Before finishing, I needed to use the restroom, and when I got back, my laptop&apos;d glitched out again.
		I couldn&apos;t read the screen, as it&apos;d gotten too staticy and after a bit, it froze altogether.
		Again, it wouldn&apos;t boot.
		After several tries, I got it working again, but even as I type this paragraph, the blue glitch streaks have returned.
		I&apos;ve now backed up ll my files of consequence.
		The only important file I might lose if <code>morgan</code> dies will be my journaling from today onward and my coursework from this week.
		At least, hopefully.
		I&apos;m going to try to quarantine all important file-changing on my computer to my website.
		That&apos;ll give me a smaller set of files to back up, and due to my journal and coursework, I can&apos;t get out of changing my website files anyway.
		<code>morgan</code>&apos;s stupid warrantee was voided because I needed to open the hard drive by so save the files from my old system.
		That won&apos;t happen this time.
	</p>
	<p>
		This will be the first time I&apos;ve been in the same mindset during the naming of two consecutive machines.
		<a href="/en/domains/chicken.local.xhtml"><code>chicken</code></a> was named before I had this domain and before I was vegan.
		It was my server, and was named for the fact that it ran headless.
		Yeah, I know.
		Morbid.
		I wasn&apos;t exactly in my right mind in those days.
		When I got my new domain, I renamed the server, changing its fully-qualified domain name to reflect the change, but leaving the local name the same.
		I&apos;m pretty sure <a href="/en/domains/thinkpad-x60s.local.xhtml"><code>thinkpad-x60s</code></a> predates this domain as well.
		It was named with an utter lack of creativity, and simply was given the host name it had before I installed the operating system.
		The original host name matched the model of the machine.
		I think <a href="/en/domains/newdawn.local.xhtml"><code>newdawn</code></a> was the first machine I named after getting my domain, and its name represented my hope for life to improve.
		It didn&apos;t; it got worse.
		Next came <a href="/en/domains/cepo.local.xhtml"><code>cepo</code></a>.
		<code>chicken</code> had died, and I needed a server to run an onion address on.
		I was studying Esperanto at the time, and &quot;cepo&quot; in Esperanto means &quot;onion&quot;.
		And that brings us to <code>morgan</code>; named a unisex human name.
		I thought I had <code>frankie</code> in there too, a Frankenbuild.
		My records show no sign of this machine though, meaning that it must predate this domain, and thus predate <a href="/y.st./source/y.st./source/pages/en/weblog/2015/03-March/07.xhtml">the incident</a>.
		I guess that means I can reuse the name <code>frankie</code> at some point, though probably not on my next machine.
		I&apos;m going with another unisex human name though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess I should try to get another computer soon.
		Ugh.
		Another expenditure of much time and money.
		I don&apos;t have time today or tomorrow though, and likely won&apos;t have time this week.
		I hope <code>morgan</code> holds up that long.
	</p>
	<p>
		(I couldn&apos;t sign my <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> today, as <code>morgan</code> ended up giving up the ghost entirely by the end of the day.)

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		<code>morgan</code> wasn&apos;t functioning this morning, so I wasn&apos;t able to take notes right away about my dream as I usually do when I remember them.
		I was awake almost two hours before I could get the laptop running and I ran an errand, so my dream faded from memory.
		I remember the ending though.
		I was picking up sunflower seed shells with someone, and one of them had a pair of what looked like tiny moth larva, wrapped in their usual cocoons.
		Something distracted me; I forget what.
		I forgot about the larva and continued picking up shells.
		A bit later, I find the larva, outside their cocoons, crawling on my left hand.
		I knock them off, but then my hand is covered in strange and grotesque insects and arachnids.
		I forget what I held in my right hand, but it was long and thin like a pencil or twig, and I used it to pry the things off.
		They held a pretty good grip on my skin, and whenever I&apos;d successfully get one off, it&apos;d seem to be replaced with a different-looking on while I was busy trying to get rid of the next.
		The final one I was prying off before I woke up had what looked like some sort of oval, toothy jaw on the tip of its abdomen.
		I didn&apos;t see it when it was closed, but when I tried to pry that creature off, it&apos;s back end flared up and the mouth-thing opened up.
		It looked like it was going to try to bite (for lack of a better word, as it wasn&apos;t the creature&apos;s actual mouth) me and I wasn&apos;t sure how much damage it could do to me.
		It looked like a vulnerable point though, so I stopped prying and used my tool to gently push at the creature&apos;s mouth-thing, hoping to encourage it to drop off of me without killing the thing and ending up with bug guts on my hand.
		I&apos;m not sure though if I woke up before actually getting the thing off of me.
		My memory of the dream is too faded.
