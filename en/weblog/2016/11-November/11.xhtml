	My academic advisor got back to me, letting me know that there was nothing that my previous academic advisor could have done about the situation, and that they&apos;ve reported the problem to their supervisors.
	Due to being a provisional student at the time, they say that I wasn&apos;t able to access the full list of courses.
	However, they continued that I shouldn&apos;t be frustrated by the situation.
	What? Of course I should be frustrated with the situation! This was my response:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Alright, I understand that nothing could be done.
		Although, you said that this is because I was not a degree-seeking student at the time, yet on 2016-11-05, I was admitted into the degree-seeking program, and on 2016-11-06, during late registration, I wasn&apos;t able to register for other courses.
		To be clear, as a degree-seeking student, my list of courses wasn&apos;t any longer than it had been before.
	</p>
	<p>
		You say not to be frustrated, but a problem being unfixable doesn&apos;t make it any less frustrating.
		I&apos;d like to explain exactly why there *is* reason to be frustrated.
		First, I need an even number of courses to graduate, but I am only able to take one course this term instead of two.
		That means that I&apos;ll need to take the other course in the pair at a later time, setting me back a term.
		Essentially, this term isn&apos;t bringing me any closer to graduation.
		Second, it&apos;s burning elective credits that I could otherwise have put to use on a course that is more useful to my career or more interesting.
		One more thing to be frustrated by is misinformation from the university.
		The university sent me a letter that had this to say:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			You will soon be registered for two courses for the upcoming term that will be your first as a Degree Seeking Student at <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		If the school wasn&apos;t going to allow me to register for two courses and wasn&apos;t going to automatically register me for two courses, so I was only going to be able to take one course, that line shouldn&apos;t have been sent to me via email.
		If nothing else, the sending of misinformation should be fixed so that students receive correct information in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, thank you for looking into the issue.
		Have a great day!
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	I forgot to mention the fact that if this continues, I could end up running out of elective credits to burn.
	At that point, I won&apos;t be able to move forward at all, by any definition of the word.
	My advisor asked for that little rant when they dismissed my feelings by telling me that I shouldn&apos;t be frustrated.
	They could have said that they understood my frustrations.
	They could have even just ignored my frustrations and stated simple facts without addressing how I felt.
	In any case, it did feel good to vent, and I should be good to go now.
</p>
<p>
	While I was at work, a customer came in asking if we were giving away chicken, as we apparently had a couple orders of it sitting outside our store.
	Why did someone order it if they were just going to leave it outside? After telling them that we don&apos;t give it away and that i was unsure why it was out there, they left, grabbed the chicken, and headed to their vehicle.
	Um.
	Ew? I mean, eating flesh is gross, but that&apos;s not even what I&apos;m talking about.
	Some random person left it out there.
	We don&apos;t know if they did anything to it.
	We also don&apos;t know how long it&apos;s been out there, and meat gets deadly if left out too long.
</p>
<p>
	I worked the drive through window for most of the day.
	When it came time for my break, the shift leader came and told me to hand over the &quot;crown of voices&quot;, by which they meant the drive-through headset.
	I still bust up laughing when I think of it being called that.
	From now on, that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to cal it as well.
</p>
<p>
	I ended up staying late at work.
	I got more hours logged, but I also didn&apos;t really have time for <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/Leadership_Entrepreneurship_and_Strategy.xhtml">homework</a> today.
	I got a little bit done, but not much.
</p>
<p>
	On my way home from work in the dark, I saw a man riding a bicycle.
	I glanced over, at them, just because I try to be aware of my surroundings, and they kept telling me not to look at them! Of course, that made me watch them more closely, though I tried not to make it obvious.
	They pulled around the side of a house, so I thought that they were going to rob the place.
	I considered altering my course and taking a look to see what they were doing.
	If they were indeed breaking in, perhaps I should inform someone, such as law enforcement? However, I decided that putting myself in such a position wasn&apos;t safe.
	I should ignore the person and continue home.
	I watched in fear as the person came out from behind the fence on the other side of the yard; it was their yard, but they were up to something.
	I again considered altering my course, but felt that if this person was trying to get to me, a direct face-to-face situation would put me in the best possible situation, so I headed onward.
	Sure enough, they stopped me, asking me why I had been looking at their yard the other day.
	They had a strange speech impediment and were being overly paranoid about my having looked at their yard, not to mention that they didn&apos;t want me to watch them ride their bike as I walked by.
	I don&apos;t know why I&apos;d be looking at their yard.
	Perhaps they have some sort of interesting plants? The suspicious and secretive behavior makes me think that they are up to something, probably something illegal.
	The strange speech patterns make me think that perhaps they were impaired, so the illegal thing could be some sort of drug or drugs.
	In any case, I&apos;m changing my commute route.
	It&apos;s a shame too, using one of my favorite shortcuts requires that I pass by that street corner.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
