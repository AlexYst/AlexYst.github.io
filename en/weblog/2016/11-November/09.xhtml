	Unfortunately Donald Trump has won the presidential election here in the United States.
	I wasn&apos;t thrilled with the thought of Hillary Clinton running our country, but Clinton would have been better than Trump.
	With Trump in charge, does the Internet in our country have a future? Will foolish, racist laws and policies be put in place in other areas of United States law? We&apos;ll have to wait and see.
	I lost what little trust that I had in out political system when Sanders was removed from the running.
	Trump&apos;s election somehow has plunged my level of trust in the system even further down though.
</p>
<p>
	On my way to work, I stopped by the grocery store to pick up lunch.
	While I was paying for my food, I spoke with the checker, who is also against Trump.
	Apparently, another customer actually said to the checker something like <q>Now that our man&apos;s in the White House, we can finally round up those monkeys and send them back over the boarder.</q>.
	I&apos;m flabbergasted that anyone would actually say that! It really shows what an awful country the United States has become.
	There were are enough racists and idiots here to actually elect a leader that openly holds those kinds of views, then once they elected them, they come out with those views themselves.
	Disgusting.
	Just disgusting.

	Vanessa wanted the works of <a href="https://www.joshwoodward.com/">Josh Woodward</a> and <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/">Marc With a C</a> on their mobile, so I tried to copy the files over from my music library, but their device&apos;s internal storage is too small.
	I ended up giving them one of my <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> cards, which has plenty of space.
	Why do I have so many <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> cards? I have several, but I only have a use for one.
	In the past, I had a use for two, but for some reason, I have several.
	Sadly, their Android device doesn&apos;t like Ext4 <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> cards, so we had to format the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.
	Several file names don&apos;t work on <abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr> due to <abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr> rejecting the use of certain characters.
	On my system, I use meta data from the music files to name the files themseles, so tracks such as <a href="https://www.joshwoodward.com/song/AreYouHavingFun">Are You Having Fun?</a> have question marks in their file names, which the <abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr> file system choke on.
	We ran into several tracks with asterisks, colons, or quotation marks in their file names as well.
	Unsure what way to rename the files, I ended up <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-encoding any characters that the <abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr> file system complained about.
	It&apos;s ugly, but so is the <abbr title="File Allocation Table">FAT</abbr> file system.
	In any case, I showed them how to easily use <abbr title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</abbr> to transfer files between their mobile and laptop, so they should be able to add whatever else they want, provided that they can get access to the files.
	I thought that we&apos;d need to install some package to make <abbr title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</abbr> easily work from the file manager, but it seemed to just work out of the box.
	I didn&apos;t explain what <abbr title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</abbr> is though, as it seems a bit too complicated to be useful information.
	Instead, I just told them that they can plug their mobile into their laptop and drag files across like with a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> storage drive.

	My next term at University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> began today.
	Unfortunately, I&apos;m <strong>*still*</strong> in <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span> and <strong>*only*</strong> <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span>! I told myself that if this happened, I&apos;d just go with the flow and just deal with it this term.
	However, out of frustration, I reached out to the university staff.
	They told me that they&apos;d put me in two courses related to my degree program, but instead, I&apos;m in one course that isn&apos;t.
	Maybe I can&apos;t fix this, but I need to try.
	In the mean time, I&apos;ve begun my coursework.
	I&apos;ve copied down the <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/Leadership_Entrepreneurship_and_Strategy.xhtml">essay</a> topic and have downloaded the course textbook.
	If I manage to get my courses sorted out, I think it would be hilarious to write the first essay of <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span> anyway, even if I can&apos;t submit it.
	The course textbook is covered by the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</abbr> license, which is a drag, but I can delete the textbook once I&apos;m out of the course, be that by being transfered to the courses that I should actually be in or be it by completing the course and earning a passing grade.

	Marc With a C is having a <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> and vinyl sale! <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/human-slushy">The Early Stuff <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr></a> (which I thought that Marc was sold out of), <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/bubblegum-romance">Bubblegum Romance</a>, <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/this-world-is-scary-as-f-k">This World Is Scary As F**k</a> (censored by Marc, not me), <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/lifes-so-hard">Life&apos;s So Hard</a>, <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/normal-bias-remaster">Normal Bias (Remaster)</a>, <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/linda-lovelace-for-president">Linda Lovelace For President</a>, <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/losing-salt">Losing Salt</a>, <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/pop-pop-pop-2">Pop! Pop! Pop!</a>, <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/motherfuckers-be-bullshittin">Motherfuckers Be Bullshittin&apos;</a> (Marc censored &quot;Fuck&quot; in the other album title, but not &quot;Motherfuckers&quot; in this album title), and <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/popular-music">Popular Music</a> <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr>s are all on sale for $3 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> each, plus shipping! <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/retrolowfi-the-first-10-years-of-marc-with-a-c-1999-2009">RetroLoFi: The First 10 Years Of Marc With a C (1999-2009)</a> <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr>s are on sale for $5 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> each! Sadly, by the time that I started actually paying for music, this album was no longer available, in digital form or in physical form.
	Now that Marc uncovered some old copies of this that were in their linen closet, they&apos;ve made the digital release available again too! I have no idea for how long this album will be available though, so I scooped up a digital copy right away.
	In addition to digital copies and <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr>s, Marc uncovered a couple of vinyl copies of this as well, so those are on sale for $10 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> plus shipping.
	CARK (no link available), is also planned for re-release on 2016-12-12, so that&apos;ll be something to look forward to if you missed the initial one-day-only, one-store-only release.
</p>
<p>
	And lastly, a word from Marc that I hope that they won&apos;t mind my quoting:
</p>
<blockquote>If you are scared by what the new election has brought.
	I&apos;m with you.
	If you are ever targeted by what it may bring, I&apos;ll fight for you.
	&quot;They&quot; have the power, but you are not on the wrong side of history for being who you are, and I will not let you feel that you are.
	All you have to do is reach out.
	I&apos;ll do my best.
	In the meantime, I hope you&apos;ll let my offer your ears a nice distraction.
	Please take care of yourselves and each other.</blockquote>
<p>
	I&apos;m not sure what can be done, but it&apos;s a bit comforting to know that there are people out there that will stand up for those targeted by Trump&apos;s malicious racism and bigotry.
	Worse than Trump might be Trump&apos;s followers, which now think that they can do whatever.
	I don&apos;t know how homophobic and transphobic Trump is, but some of their followers sure are.
	If you&apos;re in the United States and you&apos;re not a Caucasian male, the next four years could get pretty ugly for you.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
