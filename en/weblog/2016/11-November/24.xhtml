	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I ended up not staying up as late as planned, but I did finish up the laundry when I got up in the morning.
		I woke up numerous times in the middle of the night though, so I&apos;m still not as well-rested as I&apos;d like to be.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we always do when we&apos;re in Gresham, we stopped in a local discount food store.
		They seem to sell damaged goods, such as those that have fallen off trucks and such.
		The food&apos;s perfectly good, the packaging just isn&apos;t always in perfect condition.
		Sometimes, food there is even expired, or something.
		On these expired foods though, it&apos;s usually types of foods in which the expiration date is just a formality; they stay edible and delicious far past expiration.
		While we were there, we found a nine-kilogram box of frozen peas! They were a month past their expiration date, but being frozen, they were still perfectly good.
		Even better, the box of peas only cost us $2 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>!
	</p>
	<p>
		I spent most of the day fulfilling social obligations with family members that I barely know.
		Needless to say, I didn&apos;t get much coursework done.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of the day, Vivian lent our mother their car, and we took that home with us.
		Vivian almost never uses their car, but our mother feels stranded without one.
		It&apos;s kind of sad; many of the places that our mother goes are well within walking distance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>//st.</code> registry is holding it&apos;s annual <a href="http://www.nic.st./campaign">Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale</a>.
		First-year registrations are 70% off, so if you&apos;re looking for a new <code>//st.</code> domain, now&apos;s the time! €10 <abbr title="euros">EUR</abbr> will get you a name at my favorite registry.
		Unfortunately, renewals and multi-year registrations are at regular price, so I can&apos;t renew <code>//y.st.</code> for the sale price, and I&apos;m a bit tight on funds at the moment, so I can&apos;t afford to get a new name.
		If you&apos;re looking for a semi-short name, two-character registrations are only €300 <abbr title="euros">EUR</abbr> right now.
	</p>
	<p>
		Google sent me a letter threatening to remove my forwarding number from my Google Voice account if I don&apos;t reverify it.
		I don&apos;t know what all that means though.
		I can&apos;t reverify that number, as it is no longer in my possession.
		What happens if they remove that number? I have my account in &quot;do not disturb&quot; mode, meaning that it doesn&apos;t actually forward anyway.
		Instead, everything goes straight to the answering machine, then gets transcribed and emailed to me.
		Will that continue to happen, or will my Google Voice number become unusable? Only time will tell, I suppose.
		I have until the twenty-third to decide what to do, as that&apos;s when Google says that they&apos;ll take action.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2><a href="https://git.volatile.ch./y.st./include.d/releases">include.d</a></h2>
	<p>
		I did a little work on include.d today, rearranging property-, constant-, and method-declarations to be in alphabetical order.
		This should make them easier to find when needed.
		I&apos;m still considering how best to update the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-processing <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> though.
		The upcoming changes are going to break comparability with old code, so I need to do my best to get it right this time.
		Otherwise, there could be another compatibility break in the future.

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I read through about half of the chapter that I&apos;m supposed to read this week.
		I didn&apos;t even get started on the second reading assignment.
		I&apos;m tired now though and want to get to bed, so I&apos;ll post a link to the other reading assignment tomorrow.

<section id="docmod">
	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
