	Topics for essays that I want to write outside of school:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		How the <abbr title="GNU &quot;Free&quot; Documentation License">GFDL</abbr> isn&apos;t a free license, and is effectively nonfree even when invariant sections aren&apos;t used
	</li>
	<li>
		How the telephone number system is screwy
	</li>
	<li>
		How postpaid mobile plans are bad for customers
	</li>
	<li>
		How connections using &quot;untrusted&quot; <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificates are more trustworthy than connections without any <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate at all
	</li>
	<li>
		The importance of free software
	</li>
	<li>
		The importance of free media
	</li>

	I spoke with the author of that article on <a href="https://ocramius.github.io./blog/accessing-private-php-class-members-without-reflection/">bypassing the <code>private</code> key word in <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr></a>, and it seems that while they approve of this ability to render the <code>private</code> key word ineffective, they only approve of doing this from within libraries and tools.
	They don&apos;t think that it should be used from the main code of a project.
	I don&apos;t think that closures belong in libraries and tools though, but in the main project.
	From within a library, regular, named functions and methods should be used.
	The only place that I&apos;d ever use closures is in non-library code.
	After all, closures are class instances, which makes them variables, not functions.
	With that in mind, our opinions on the usage of closures is incompatible.
	However, it doesn&apos;t detract from the real issue.
	When developers mark a property (or method) as private, they do so for a reason.
	The author said that the code used for object serialization shouldn&apos;t be contained within the class definition itself, but in my opinion, it should.
	Serialization is a feature of the objects of a class, so it should be defined by the class itself.
	If it&apos;s necessary to define it separately and not have it as part of the object (so using a parent class with the serialization code isn&apos;t an option because the code would become a part of the object&apos;s definition when the child class inherits it), make the properties protected instead of private.
	Then, have a serializer class extend the class that has the data objects and use static methods in the child class to interact with the protected properties of the parent class.
</p>

	I finished up my work on the function for finding what parts of include.d to include in a project if trying to avoid dependencies, and have made a new <a href="https://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/y.st./include.d/releases">release</a>.
	Though the point of this release is the new function, I&apos;ve also included my fixes to the main <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-handling framework.
	I wanted to wait and release those fixes with the rest of the big <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> scheme update, but my debug code makes assumptions that aren&apos;t valid for outdated versions of include.d code from before the 0.0.1.4 release.
	Specifically, the debugging code complains about repeated exception codes where the exception codes actually are unique.
	As the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-handling code is being worked on only in another branch, the version in the master branch had stagnated, so the assumptions about how to find the exception codes didn&apos;t apply, confusing the debugging code.
	I don&apos;t anticipate further issues with the branched <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-handling code though.
	I&apos;ve also removed a couple of exception classes that, had I read the description of their parent classes correctly, I would never have included in include.d anyway.
</p>
<p>
	I spent a chunk of the day looking for boxes of things that can be stashed in the storage unit, but it&apos;s not my stuff so I have no idea what needs to be kept accessible and what can be stored for the time being.
	Needless to say, it didn&apos;t go well.
	I also labeled the boxes on the high shelves in the garage though, which should be of some use.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
