	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Someone told me that Twitter is now demanding telephone numbers upon registration by new users.
		I didn&apos;t want to believe this, but I tried it for myself.
		Sure enough, Twitter demanded a telephone number, locking down my new account when I wouldn&apos;t provide one.
		I&apos;ve posted one last tweet from my real account, and will no longer be posting tweets on Twitter.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yst Dawson @Yst_D
		</p>
		<p>
			This is *EXACTLY* why I don&apos;t and won&apos;t use Facebook.
			If you need to reach me, I guess reach me off of Twitter: &lt;https://y.st/en/a/contact.xhtml&gt;.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Yst Dawson @Yst_D
			</p>
			<p>
				It has come to my attention that Twitter is demanding a that new registrants provide a telephone number.
				Not everyone has telephone service.
			</p>

		I took the dot off the end of my domain name because Twitter is too stupid to read the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> correctly with the dot there, but I assure you, the canonical version of my Web address has the dot.
		I&apos;ve also removed Twitter from my contact page, along with the Volatile <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> network, a place that I don&apos;t visit any more, and Pateron, who maliciously discriminates against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users, not allowing us to log in any more, even after filling out their obnoxious CloudFlare <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
		My telephone was due to arrive tomorrow, but FedEx rescheduled on me.
		Instead of bringing it by tomorrow, they say that they&apos;ll bring it by on <span title="Day 00625: Monday, 2016 November 21">2016-11-21</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of government assistance, perhaps its time that I seek more of it.
		Up until now, I&apos;ve only two assistance programs.
		The first is health coverage.
		I didn&apos;t seek that because I even want it, I sought it because idiotic laws that were put in place in the past few years.
		Specifically, people without health coverage now have to pay a fine as part of their taxes.
		Seriously? That&apos;s just moronic.
		The second thing that I asked the government for was the mobile device that was previously due to arrive yesterday.
		Unfortunately, most people are morons and demand that you be reachable via telephone.
		I can and do tell most of these people to just deal with the fact that they&apos;ll have to reach me without calling me.
		They can either accept that or they can give up on reaching me.
		Either way, I&apos;m happy.
		However, there are some people that you can&apos;t tell to just get over themselves, such as employers and, now that I&apos;m looking for a place to move into, landlords.
		As much as I despise the telephone number system, and by extension, the telephone system, there&apos;s not much that I can do about it in very specific circumstances.
		Maybe these aren&apos;t the only programs that I should enroll in though.
		My mother claims that my not being a republican is a symptom of my being unrealistic; that if I understood what life is really like, I&apos;d have a strong conservative view.
		I&apos;ve been too prideful to enroll in programs such as food assistance, but if I&apos;m going to advocate trying to stand up for people over corporations and aid for the poor, maybe I should take this aid, while I&apos;m poor and could really use it.
		When I&apos;m in a better situation in life, I can look back and see how much this helped me or didn&apos;t.
		I can get a better idea of how these systems work and see if I truly agree with the way that they&apos;re set up.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother finally saw reason, and decided that the Wi-Fi hotspot is necessary, even if it&apos;s not locked away from the world with a stupid password.
		I can now access the Internet on my laptop through my mobile again, though more importantly for my mother, they can access the Internet on their own mobile by using <strong>*my*</strong> data plan.
		My mother makes no sense.
		They don&apos;t like that their own data plan is limited and has potential overage charges, but they acknowledge the fact that my plan is unlimited.
		Why do they not switch? I mean, now, it&apos;s too late, because they signed a stupid contract, but why did they not switch when they had the chance?

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I had a very strange dream last night.
		I can&apos;t recall all of it, but I was running some sort of investigation into ... something, while also participating in some sort of investigation.
		Some friend of mine got jealous of one of my other friends and tried to take both of us out, saying that they weren&apos;t a suitable mate for me.
		However, our relationship wasn&apos;t anything like that.
		I nearly died out of some sort of misunderstanding.
	</p>
	<p>
		I woke up way too early though, so I went back to bed and dreamed about catching a bright green bullfrog with a triangle pattern all over its back.
	</p>

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I spent my breaks at work reading my school textbook, and came across some interesting things.
		First, there&apos;s a list of the main values that people hold.
		Looking down the list, it seems that every one of them is something that my mother strongly believes in or I do, but we each hold the exact opposite opinion on each of them.
		It&apos;s no wonder that the two of us can never get along.
		Also though, I found some information that I find rather depressing.
		It says that people cannot be convinced to change their minds using data.
		If you present them with data that confirms their beliefs, the continue beliving what they already did.
		However, if you present data that <strong>*contradicts*</strong> their beliefs, they cling to their beliefs even stronger! There&apos;s just no way to win and I find that very, very sad.

<section id="apartment">
	<h2>Apartment hunting</h2>
	<p>
		I tried to fill out the rental application again, but it asked for my bank account balance.
		I tried to log in to view my balance, but Oregon Community Credit Union refused to allow me to log in.
		I thought that I&apos;d have to go visit the credit union in person and find out what&apos;s up, but when I got back from work, the website had stopped acting up and I was able to get my balance.
		First Tech Federal Credit Union allowed me to log in, but required that I change my password (presumably because I haven&apos;t logged in for so long) and won&apos;t provide me with my account numbers.
		I ended up going to speak with them in person on my way to work to get the account numbers.
		I was expecting to need to write them down, but the teller just went to the back and printed a page for me with my account numbers and balances.
