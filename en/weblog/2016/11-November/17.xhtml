			<h1>Eleven days</h1>
			<p>Day 00621: Thursday, 2016 November 17</p>
		</header>
<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_4.0/y.st./weblog/2016/11/17.png" alt="My new, simple font" class="weblog-header-image" width="811" height="480" />
<p>
	<strong>Current countdown:</strong> 11 days to find a place to live
</p>
<h2 id="general">General news</h2>
<p>
	I spent <strong>*way*</strong> more time on this than I should have (it took about four hours), but I drew a new, tiny, simple font and used it to add copyright and license information to all of the weblog header images on the site.
	The unedited originals are still available in the Git repository if anyone wants them, but now when I leave the files places (which I sometimes do), the website <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> will be visible.
	As a side benefit, inconsiderate hotlinkers will be displaying my <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> on their webpages as well.
	Please don&apos;t hotlink though.
	Download the images and host them yourself if you want to use them.
	You can check out the <a href="https://git.volatile.ch./y.st./y.st./src/master/weblog%20source%20images%20%28CC%20BY-SA%204.0%29">Git repository</a> if you&apos;re looking for the unedited originals without my branding.
	As I said several days ago, editing <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s always degrades their quality, so on my older, cropped photographs, I went back and used the originals.
	I also took that opportunity to scale and crop them to be uniform with the more recent weblog header images from after I found a standard size to use.
	This has resulted in some different photographic arrangements.
	These photographs weren&apos;t taken with their new croppings in mind.
</p>
<p>
	As for my font itself, I needed a small character set that would cover what I need covered, but not much more.
	After all, every character covered is one that I have to draw, and if I have to draw it but it&apos;s not useful, that&apos;s just wasted effort.
	It&apos;s not possible to type in this font, so I&apos;m probably going to be the only one using it.
	After some thinking, I settled on the character set composed of all characters that are valid to have in a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.
	The main downside to this character set for my use case is the lack of angle brackets, which are ironically helpful when dealing with <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s.
	Maybe I will add angle brackets and a few other characters at some point if I find a reasonable excuse to do that.
</p>
<p>
	I really shouldn&apos;t have made this font before going to bed last night.
	I figured that because I have a night shift today, I&apos;d just sleep in.
	That didn&apos;t work out though, I still got up on time, and now I spent the day being mostly unproductive.
	If I had gone to bed and made this font in the morning, It would have taken the same amount of time to complete, but I&apos;d also have plenty of energy.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully, it was a fairly easy day at work.
	I worked the drive-through window, which is probably the position that takes the least hit from customer rushes.
	While everyone else scrambles to production high enough, the drive-through can only go so quickly.
	I guess that we weren&apos;t hit with <strong>*too*</strong> much business though, as the dishes that I was washing in the back didn&apos;t stack up too high.
</p>
<p>
	I worked until closing time, getting everything cleaned, then helped get the few remaining things in order that we couldn&apos;t finish with with customers around.
	We had a lot of leftover chicken wings that would just get thrown out if no one took them, so my coworker asked if I wanted any.
	I thanked them, but said that I don&apos;t eat meat, and they started calling me a weirdo.
	Later, they offered me breadsticks that would otherwise be thrown out, and I had to say that I don&apos;t each cheese either.
	(The breadsticks that we sell have a light powdering of cheese on them.) Now they must really think that I&apos;m strange.
	Oh, well.
	It can&apos;t be helped.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
</p>
<h2 id="university">University life</h2>
<p>
	Knowing that I needed to get my rental application filled out, I resolved to fill that out before working on coursework.
	However, being tired, I kept finding ways to put off working on the application.
	As such, I didn&apos;t get as much reading done for school as I should have.
	It&apos;s too bad too, if I hadn&apos;t been putting off working on the rental application, I&apos;d probably have finished my reading assignment.
</p>
<p>
	I should have read on my break at work, and in fact, I did read a little.
	However, I quickly realized that I shouldn&apos;t do that on so little sleep.
	I didn&apos;t want to do anything that would make it harder to make it through the work day.
</p>
<h2 id="apartment">Apartment hunting</h2>
<p>
	I tried to fill out the rental application that I picked up yesterday, but it requires two references, along with the home addresses and telephone numbers of those references.
	The references may not be related to me in any way and must have known me for at least one year.
	Yesterday, my boss said that I can use them as a reference, but I needed to get their home address from them to do so.
	I still needed a second reference though.
	I caught one of the shift leaders that&apos;s known me for several years on their short walk home, and got them to agree to be a reference for me.
	I actually know where they live, and I can get both people&apos;s telephone numbers off of the telephone roster.
	My manager refused to disclose their address though, saying that their telephone number should be good enough on the application.
	I understand how they feel.
	I felt really strange even asking them for their address.
	Not only that, but if someone were to ask me for several pieces of information, there are certain pieces that I&apos;d deny them, saying that the rest should be good enough.
	My home address isn&apos;t one, especially as it&apos;s in my public whois record anyway, but I can easily see why a home address would be something that other people wouldn&apos;t want to hand out.
</p>
<p>
	Before actually <strong>*forcing*</strong> myself to work on the application, I heavily considered putting it off until tomorrow.
	I&apos;m on a schedule though, and I <strong>*must*</strong> make at least some sort of progress each day.
	It&apos;s too bad that today&apos;s progress was simply learning that I needed another reference and a home address of my current reference, failing to get said address, and getting the second reference.
	It would have been great to be able to say that I&apos;d handed in the application today.
	However, this does bring me closer to being able to fill out this application, and thus, closer to finding a home.
