<p>
	Current countdowns:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>247 scheme-specific <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-parsing classes to write and add to <a href="https://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/y.st./include.d/releases">include.d</a></li>
	<li>1 free elective left in my associate degree program</li>
	<li>4 free electives left in my bachelor degree program</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Topics for essays that I want to write outside of school:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How the <abbr title="GNU &quot;Free&quot; Documentation License">GFDL</abbr> isn&apos;t a free license, and is effectively nonfree even when invariant sections aren&apos;t used</li>
<li>How the telephone number system is screwy</li>
<li>How postpaid mobile plans are bad for customers</li>
<li>How connections using &quot;untrusted&quot; <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificates are more trustworthy than connections without any <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate at all</li>
<li>The importance of free software</li>
<li>The importance of free media</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I set up the exception framework that I talked about yesterday, and have now released a new version of <a href="https://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/y.st./include.d/releases">include.d</a>.
	This really is a minor update, but it paves the way for future work.
	The <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> branch is going to see many exception-throwing instances added by the time that it finishes.
	It&apos;ll be much easier to fix up my use of exceptions now so I have fewer to go back and replace later.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;ve also started making commits in the <code>master</code> branch of the Git repository, a practice that I was avoiding once I started using other branches.
	The idea had been that the stable version of include.d was available from that branch.
	However, I made my release a bit too early, so I didn&apos;t think of a couple things that I should have coded and later went back to touch them up.
	These things weren&apos;t big enough to warrant another release, but keeping a side branch to remember to tuck into the next release seems inefficient.
	I&apos;ve already started using Gogs&apos; &quot;release&quot; feature, so there&apos;s no need to additionally keep the <code>master</code> branch at a stable position.
	From here on out, I&apos;ll use the <code>master</code> branch for small touch ups that should exist in every branch, in addition to any stable code that, again, needs to find its way into the other branches.
</p>
<p>
	It looks like my old count of the number of <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> schemes left to build <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> classes for was somehow off by two, so I&apos;ve corrected that in my notes.
	I still have 247 schemes left to go though.
	I had hoped to finish one scheme per day, but that was far too ambitious.I knew that I wouldn&apos;t be able to keep that up once school was back in session, but I was hoping to make decent progress until that point.
	At this rate, it&apos;s going to take <strong>*years*</strong> to finish the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> update for include.d.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
