	University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> wrote today, saying that my entry into the course that I shouldn&apos;t even be taking, <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span>, has been approved.
	There has been no word about entry into the courses that I actually need and want.
	This is extremely frustrating.
	I have to keep reminding myself that this is going to work itself out, one way or another.
	If they fix the issue and get me into the correct courses, everything will be fine.
	If I instead end up stuck in <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span> and only <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span>, there are still two advantages.
	First of all, I&apos;ll only be taking one course this term.
	Hopefully, we&apos;ll be moving this term, so having only one course to deal with during the moving period would make things a bit easier.
	Second, it&apos;ll throw off my term count.
	I have an even number of courses that I need to take to graduate, and I should be taking two courses per term.
	If I take only one course this term, assuming that this sort of issue never happens again, I&apos;ll need to stay in school an extra term to take one course.
	Of course, I might be able to take a second course that term, fitting in an extra course overall that I wouldn&apos;t have otherwise been able to take.
	To be clear, I somehow want things to work out so that I end up in the correct courses this term.
	However, I need to keep in mind that even if things don&apos;t work out, things will work out.
	Keeping that in mind is all that I can do to keep my stress level from going through the roof right now.
</p>
<p>
	Today is the last day that I&apos;ll really have off for a great while.
	I have shifts at work for the next four days, and starting the day after tomorrow, I also have school.
	I figured that I might as well enjoy myself while there&apos;s still time, so I took a long walk downtown.

	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
