	I did not sleep well that night.
	I got about five hours of sleep.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;m getter at managing the voices of the crown.
	Today, then didn&apos;t drive me nuts like they did yesterday, despite the fact that today was extremely fast-paced.
	All day, we had customers pouring through.
	None of us seemed to have any idea why they were all there either, as it was supposed to be a fairly slow work day.
	Speaking of the crown, it seems that it has a voice of its own; it doesn&apos;t just relay voices from customers at the menu board.
	After I&apos;d been wearing it for most of the day, it stated telling me to change its battery.
	We don&apos;t actually have extra batteries though.
	I wasn&apos;t sure if we did or not, but I just put the crown on the charger and grabbed a different one.
	We have about six of the things.
	I later talked to one of the shift leaders, and it seems that the store was offered the chance to keep a bunch of spare batteries on hand, but nobody wanted to deal with that.
	Only one crown is needed at a time, so it&apos;s easier to just switch crowns and not bother with the batteries themselves.
	I&apos;ve also done a bit more experimenting with the credit card chip reader, and it seems that the speed increase from inserting the chip before entering the price of the order is more than just because of a head start in processing the chip.
	I have no idea what&apos;s going on, but if I enter the price of the order, then insert the chip when told to, it takes about ten seconds for the chip reader to process the chip.
	If I instead insert the chip first, then enter the price of the order, it only takes me a couple of seconds, but the chip reader is already finished when I am.
	It&apos;s very peculiar.
</p>
<p>
	While working the drive-through window, one pair of customers came through with a pair of green birds.
	I think that they were some sort of parrot, but I&apos;m not really a bird expert.
	I&apos;d love to have been able to get a photograph of them, but I can&apos;t exactly be taking photographs while I&apos;m on the clock.
	You&apos;ll have to settle for a photograph of some splotchy poinsettias that I found in the grocery store on my way to work.
</p>
<p>
	I really think that a full- to mid-sized tablet would be good for me.
	I need to be completing my school-assigned readings while I&apos;m on my breaks at work.
	My laptop&apos;s too bulky to bring places, doesn&apos;t have great battery life, and takes a while to boot.
	It&apos;s not a long while, considering that it&apos;s a fully-functional computer instead of a tablet computer, but it&apos;s not great on the go.
	However, I can&apos;t allow my lack of a full-sized tablet keep me from being productive.
	I need to start putting my assigned readings on my tiny tablet, my GT-i9100M, and using that to read at work.
	It&apos;s not the perfect solution, but it&apos;s what I&apos;ve got for now.
