			<h1>A day lost to wandering</h1>
			<p>Day 00427: <time>Saturday, 2016 May 07</time></p>
		</header>
<p>
	Vanessa, our mother, and I began our day by going to watch some sort of boat-landing permission ceremony down at the docks.
	Apparently, the two ships needed to get permission from the two local Native American tribes, at least one of which was represented by Native Americans that run one of the local casinos.
	My guess is that theses same Native Americans own the docks too or something, and that this ceremony was more to draw attention to both the casino and the ships to get people interested in them.
	We were able to take a tour of both boats, and it seems that they are selling tickets for events such as battle reenactments and adventure reenactments.
	The sea vessels were mildly interesting, but what really drew my attention was the setup of the docks themselves.
	Obviously, the docks need to be at sea level to be useful, but because of the tides, sea level changes throughout the day.
	To account for this, it seems that the docks just float on top of the water instead of being a solidly-anchored structure.
	The dock isn&apos;t even attached to the posts that hold it in place.
	Instead, the posts come up through holes in the docks, keeping them in place on the horizontal plane but allowing them to move freely on the vertical axis.
	The ramp down to the dock even has wheels at the bottom (and ostensibly hinges at the top) to allow it to change its angle to deal with the rising and falling dock.
	Many coastal residents probably think that all of that is no big deal, but for someone such as myself that is used to living further inland, it was very interesting to see.
</p>
<p>
	After that, we spent much of the day pointlessly wandering, burning fossil fuels all the way.
	We stopped at yard sales if we saw them, but finding yard sales didn&apos;t seem to be the goal.
	Instead, our mother didn&apos;t know what she wanted to do and has no care for her carbon footprint.
	We later dropped Vanessa off at a party, but we continued the wandering until it was time to pick her up again.
	Once we had regrouped, we went to a gathering of some of our mother&apos;s friends.
	She didn&apos;t want to stay long though, so she claimed that she needed to leave to take Vanessa to a party, despite that party already being over.
	It&apos;s a shame that such excuses are even needed.
	People should be able to just say that they just want to stop by for a few minutes without sounding rude when they leave.
	Upon finishing with the group, we headed out to the hills to gather bullet shells.
</p>
<p>
	Once back in town, we explored downtown a bit, thankfully on foot.
	My mother is trying to meet a daily number of steps taken using her pedometer, so that gave us an excuse not to have to ride around in the car.
	Walking is quite enjoyable, but it seems to take having a daily stepping goal to get her to go out on walks.
	I&apos;d say that it was because of her lack of time, but we wasted most of the day wandering in the van.
	Time really isn&apos;t the issue here.
