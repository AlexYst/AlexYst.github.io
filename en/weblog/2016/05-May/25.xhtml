			<h1>Cleaning the garage</h1>
			<p>Day 00445: Wednesday, 2016 May 25</p>
		</header>
<p>
	I mostly worked on cleaning up the garage today.
	Some things shouldn&apos;t be in the garage, so they needed to be removed, while other things just needed to be consolidated, as like items were not grouped together.
	Even after working on it all day, I don&apos;t feel like I made much progress.
	Most of the stuff is either too large to keep anywhere besides the garage or is boxed stuff that we don&apos;t have anywhere better to store for now.
</p>
<p>
	I have all but proved that the connection issues from yesterday are on Volatile&apos;s side, not mine.
	Of the onion-based <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> networks that I&apos;m on, Volatile is the only one that I go through this connect/disconnect cycle on.
	That said, I&apos;m the only one that&apos;s connecting and disconnecting every ten minutes, so I can&apos;t rule out the possibility that the problem is on my end.
</p>
<p>
	Once our mother came home, they wanted to go collect bullet shells, so they, Cyrus, Vanessa, and I headed for the hills.
	It seems that our mother and I will go to the laundromat tomorrow.
	I&apos;ll wait at the laundromat waiting for the cycle to complete and guarding against laundry theft while my mother runs other errands.
