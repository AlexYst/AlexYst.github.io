	My knees hurt from all the biking that I&apos;ve been doing lately, especially the long ride though the park yesterday.
	I should have worked on the development of <a href="https://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/y.st./include.d">include.d</a>, but instead I decided to take the day off.
	Frances, our cat, came over and sat on my lap purring for at least half an hour.
	I have a short laundry list of things that I need to get done soon though:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		finish sorting the last of my belongings to get rid of more things
	</li>
	<li>
		test <a href="/en/domains/thinkpad-x60s.local.xhtml"><code>thinkpad-x60s.local.</code></a>
	</li>
	<li>
		pay my University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> application fee
	</li>
	<li>
		catch up in processing political email
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Speaking of my University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> application fee, University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> emailed me today saying that I need to pay the fee soon.
	On June first, they are raising their application fee by ten dollars.
	I would hate to have to pay more just because I waited.
	As a tangent though, their emails are horridly formatted.
	They have both a plain text version and an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> version, but the plain text version has only &quot;Lorem ipsum ...&quot; filler text.
	Someone made a major mistake on their side, and all of their emails to me seem to have this issue.
	Because of how my new <a href="apt:icedove">email client</a> is set up, it&apos;s a major pain to read what they tell me.
	I have to hunt for the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> email view option, read the email, then set it back so I can read the rest of my emails in plain text.
	My old <a href="apt:evolution">email client</a> allowed me to view all emails as plain text, but view the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> copy as an attachment; this allowed me to view any single email in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> form without hunting through settings, without having to set the client to quit using the plain text version of every email, and without having to set my settings back afterwards.
</p>
<p>
	I wanted to get out a bit today instead of sitting around the house, so I planned to take a short ride to the end of the street and back.
	That didn&apos;t end up happening though.
	Instead, I decided to work on weeding the flowerbeds.
	When we first came to live here, the lawn was almost completely dead.
	Now, the lawn is overrun by both grass and a variety of weeds (it&apos;s quite beautiful, in my opinion) and the flowerbeds are choked with grass (not so lovely).
	I&apos;m leaving the lawn alone; removing the weeds would only leave large bare spots.
	While I worked, the local cat from last time that I weeded came back to try to get some attention.
	It walked up onto my lap, purred, pawed at my face, and rubbed its facial scent glands on my hat.
	I&apos;m not sure why it likes us so much, but that cat is always so friendly.
</p>
<p>
	Over all, it was a very pleasant morning.
	Once my mother arrived home though, the pleasantness ended.
	They were yelling at Cyrus and Vanessa again as the three of them came home.
	One of our mother&apos;s major complaints was that Cyrus&apos; graduation walk is costing them a lot.
	The graduation cap and gown aren&apos;t cheap! On the other hand though, they still complain that I <strong>*didn&apos;t*</strong> walk for my graduation.
	I saved that time and money, yet they have a problem with that.
	They can&apos;t have it both ways.
	Either one walks or one doesn&apos;t walk.
	Our mother is now also insisting that Cyrus pay our mother&apos;s lawyer bills caused by our father and the utility bills for the period of time that our mother was the paying party but our father was the only one there to use the utilities.
	It sounds like Cyrus&apos;ll be withdrawing their savings tomorrow to pay as much as he can of that, though there&apos;s no way that they can pay that whole cost.
</p>

	While I was cleaning out my belongings looking for things to part with, I found an old <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> with photographs and art from my high school days.
	Oddly, the files on the <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> were only readable by root, which doesn&apos;t make sense to me.
	As far as I know, the file system used on <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> doesn&apos;t have file permissions.
	I copied the contents to my computer, but then I wanted to snap the <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> in half to prevent future reading.
	I&apos;m not fond of the thought of people having photographs of me.
	Instead though, I offered it to my mother in hopes that it would aid in calming them down.
	While I don&apos;t understand their fascination with photographs of the past, they do tend to be in a better mood after looking at old photographs.
	After looking at them, my mother asked me to put the <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> on her <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> shelf, where it&apos;ll likely be forgotten.
	If my mother does calm down, I&apos;ll probably just leave it there, but if they continue threatening to boot Cyrus, I&apos;ll probably take the <abbr title="compact disc">CD</abbr> back and dispose of it properly.
</p>
<p>
	Looking at the photographs myself, I recognized several of the people there as former friends, but now, I can&apos;t even remember their names.
	The graphics projects are stupidly saved in the lossy <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format, which is a bit disappointing.
	Of the three, one falls entirely under my copyright, so I now release it under the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International">CC BY-SA 4.0</abbr> license.
	One contains text in a font that I am unsure of the freedom of.
	I don&apos;t even know how to begin tracking down what font is being used, so for now, I&apos;ll keep that image to myself.
	If I give up, I&apos;ll just white out the text and release what I can.
	The third image was a <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr>ed image that combined components of two images found online with a few other edits, such as color changes.
	The end result was a flock of fish-colored birds flying amongst sea creatures underwater.
	The chances that I could actually track down the exact images used to find their license status is slim to none, and even if I did do that, the effort would almost certainly be in vain.
	I didn&apos;t understand licensing at that point in my life and almost certainly didn&apos;t luck into choosing free images.
	I consider this third image to be unsalvageable and won&apos;t be releasing any part of it.
	To release it would be to disrespect the freedoms of anyone that ever sees or copy the image.
	The first image is below:
</p>
<p>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_4.0/y.st./tessellation.jpg" alt="tessellation of block people" class="framed-centred-image"/>
</p>
<p>
	As you can see, it probably should be cleaned up or redone if used for anything even semi-professional, but it&apos;s an interesting concept piece.
	With cleaner repetition and a couple gradients or patterns, it might turn out kind of cool.
	The monogram in the lower right corner should probably be removed as well.
	I used to sign my work with it, but that&apos;s no longer my signature.
