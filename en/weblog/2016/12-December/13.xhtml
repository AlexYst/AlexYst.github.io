	<h2>Unsponsored advertisements</h2>
	<p>
		My <a href="https://libremas.singpolyma.net/">holiday greeting card</a> arrived! Strangely, it came with twenty-five of a strange Christmas-specific greeting card.
		That might have been for advertising though, as this card had the domain name of the company that printed it on the back.
		When I first saw the box that the cards came in, I thought it a bit large for one card, then when I opened it and saw the inner package of twenty-six cards, I had thought that they had sent twenty-six of the card that I&apos;d ordered.
		I thought that the website that I&apos;d ordered from had been unclear, asking for the number of greeting cards that I wanted, but actually meaning the number of <strong>*sets*</strong> of greeting cards, without specifying how many are in a set.
		I want the one greeting card to give to my mother, but I&apos;m unsure what to do with a whole case of them.
		In general, I&apos;d avoid giving holiday-based greeting cards, especially because it would send a mixed message.
		I oppose the very existence of holidays, so it makes little sense for me to recognize holidays with greeting cards.

		Another representative from the <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> Teeshirt Team wrote to me, asking where to send my teeshirt and saying that maybe if they send me a shirt, it&apos;d give me incentive to get my <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> node back up.
		I explained the situation as to why my node is down: The only two utilities I&apos;ve had since June are power and water.
		I&apos;m working on getting moved, after which I&apos;d love to get my <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> node back up, but for now, I&apos;m stuck without a home Internet connection and without a way to host anything, including a <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> node.
		It sounds like they&apos;re sending the teeshirt anyway though.

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		Today at work, I was working with the shift leader that turned off the vents before, so I kept an eye on things.
		I&apos;m not sure why the vents were on yet, as the oven was off, but the shift leader came to the back and shut them off.
		At that point, I kept a close eye on the oven, and a bit later, I saw that it had been switched on.
		Of course, I switched the vents back on at that point.
		The ovens release a toxic fume as they work, which is fine as long as the vents are on, but gets pretty bad if the vents are shut off.
		A bit later, they came back and switched off the vents again.
		I watched them do it from the other side of the room, so I immediately headed over as they slipped out and I flipped them back on seconds after they&apos;d been turned off.
		The shift leader has no right to poison the other four of us just because they&apos;re cold.
		A bit later though, much to my surprise, one of the other crew members came back later and turned them off again! Once more, I flipped them back on.
		We have the vents for a reason.
		Still later, the shift leader flipped them off again and confronted me about it.
		I said that we all have a right to not breathe toxic fumes, and that if they wanted to turn off the vents, they needed to turn off the ovens as well.
		That was scary.
		That&apos;s one of our least-scary shift leaders, aside from the fact that they&apos;re currently putting their own warmth above the safety of the whole crew, but it&apos;s still hard for me to stand up to even those that I outrank, let alone those that outrank me.
		They dropped the issue though, and everything was fine.
		They knew that they were in the wrong here.
		I had gone over the discussion going very badly in my head several times and how I&apos;d react, but none of that was needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s worth noting though that this shift leader is a former smoker and the crew member that also wanted the vents off is a current smoker.
		In other words, they both value small pleasures more than the avoidance of toxic air.
		If they weren&apos;t a smoker and a former smoker, I might think that they&apos;re genuinely much colder than I am and maybe they need warmth more than I need clean air.
		However, it&apos;s kind of hard to take them seriously when I know where their priorities lie.
		It&apos;s also worth mentioning that the current-smoker crew member went out into the cold to take a smoke break later in the day.
		If they&apos;re legitimately too cold to have the vents on, they&apos;re much too cold to go outside just to smoke.
		The shift leader ended up sitting in the pizza warmer for a while to warm themself, which is a much better idea.
		Not only does it involve a higher concentration of heat being poured directly on them, it also doesn&apos;t involve harming everyone else.
		I&apos;ll keep names of these two to myself though.
		I really don&apos;t want to get anyone in trouble, I just want clean air to breathe.
	</p>
	<p>
		I worked in the back for most of the day, making the pizza dough with one of the other crew members.
		I don&apos;t really know them very well yet, but they expressed an interest in the vegan hot dogs that I&apos;d brought in, chopped, and dumped on the potatoes that I&apos;d also brought in, so I offered them a box of both potatoes and the chopped hot dogs on their break.
		I always make more than I&apos;m going to eat, then take home any leftovers if need be.
		They said that that sounded very good right then, and I don&apos;t think that they&apos;d brought anything to eat.
		I&apos;m usually happy to share.
		I don&apos;t get to eat anything that our store produces because it all contains cheese, but the food there must get boring for everyone else.
		If I&apos;m being honest though, I suppose that I do have an ulterior motive too.
		Every bite of my vegan food that they eat is a bite of our store&apos;s nonvegan food that they don&apos;t eat.
		I&apos;m saving the planet slightly, one shared meal at a time.

		Bandcamp got back to me about the credit card issue.
		It seems that my card was declined because it&apos;s serviced by Discover, the artist that I tried to subscribe to is in Europe, European Bandcamp subscriptions are handled by some card processor called Stripe, and Stripe doesn&apos;t accept cards from Discover.
		In other words, the one-dollar, temporary test charges that I received from Bandcamp were performed by Bandcamp, but the actual charge that was unable to be performed was being attempted by another company.
		However, Discover is listed as a payment option on the subscription page.
		I sent a screenshot in response, suggesting that if Discover credit cards can&apos;t be used for subscriptions to European artists, the Discover icon should be removed from the subscription pages of European artists.
		It could prevent future confusion.
		In fact, I actually considered that the subscription form might not take cards serviced by Discover, but I ruled that out because the Discover icon was present, clearly indicating that Discover cards were an acceptable option.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I want to subscribe, I think that my best bet is to try to get a Visa debit card from my credit union.
		Will I be able to get one without my legal name on it though? We&apos;ll have to see when I get the time.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother freaked out on me again, this time because I couldn&apos;t satisfy one of their idle curiosities.
		First, they wanted to know if I made overtime for working more than eight hours in a day, so I told them that we don&apos;t make overtime based on daily shifts, but weekly time.
		If we work more than forty hours in a week, that&apos;s when overtime pay kicks in.
		However, they then wanted to know when our pay week starts.
		My bosses have never given me this information.
		I said that I assume that our pay week starts on Sunday, but that I don&apos;t know for sure.
		My mother started throwing a tizzy about that.
		Why do they even care? It&apos;s not like it even effects them.
	</p>
	<p>
		After work, I hand-washed all my work uniforms and hung them to dry, and hand-washed a load of dishes.
		This is really getting to be a pain.
		I hate not having a dryer, and I especially hate not having a washing machine and a dishwasher.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I had a strange dream where my whole house was filled with non-human animals and we were all trying to get them out.
		I horse pooped in my bedroom, which was unpleasant.
	</p>

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		My program advisor (who by the way, isn&apos;t the one that I asked about the online university meet-up) got back to me, saying that I&apos;d need the Adobe Flash plugin installed in my Web browser in order to attend.
		Their phrasing made it sound like I would need to install it, not that they recognized that it meant that I&apos;d be unable to attend like I&apos;d stated in my initial letter.
		I wrote back thanking them for the information, and once again made it clear that that meant I&apos;d be unable to attend, and mentioned that maybe future meetings wouldn&apos;t have that requirement and I&apos;d be able to participate.
		I&apos;m unsure if <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> Gnash would be able to stand in for Adobe Flash in this case, as Gnash only works with some Flash objects so far.
		It&apos;s not worth requesting the day off from work on a &quot;maybe&quot;.
		I&apos;ve done my part by making it known that Flash is a barrier to entry, so that&apos;s all that I&apos;m really obligated to do.
