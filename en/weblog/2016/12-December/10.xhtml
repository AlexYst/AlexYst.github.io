		I had a chat with a Discover representative (which unfortunately required temporarily disabling Privacy Badger), as just as I thought, the decline of my credit card isn&apos;t something that Discover&apos;s doing.
		Bandcamp is doing it.
		I wrote to Bandcamp again to see if I could get them to help:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yesterday and today, Bandcamp has been declining my credit card.
			I double-checked with Discover, the servicer of the card, and it&apos;s not them doing it.
			Furthermore, your system successfully charges the temporary one-dollar test charge before declining my card, something that your system would be unable to do if the problem was on Discover&apos;s end.
			Can you please help with this?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you!

		One of the customers at work asked me if I&apos;d tried one of our newer products.
		I can&apos;t eat anything that we serve there, with the exception of the cups of marinara sauce, because everything else that we serve there has cheese.
		All that I could tell them was that I&apos;d heard that it was good and that it&apos;s one of our popular items (both of which are true), but without a personal endorsement, they didn&apos;t want to take the risk on a product that they hadn&apos;t had before.
		I can&apos;t personally endorse anything that we sell though, which is kind of sad.
		It&apos;s not fun working for a company that you can&apos;t really stand behind.

	<h2><a href="https://git.volatile.ch./y.st./include.d/releases">include.d</a></h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve changed my mind about adding new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> classes to every new include.d release.
		It isn&apos;t feasible at the moment without entirely halting include.d development.
		I only have time to add features that I actually need right now.
		I&apos;ll add the rest of the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> classes when my life is less hectic.
		For now, my main goal with include.d should be to get it back into a releasable state so that I can make use of some of the new features that I&apos;ve already added.
		One in particular would allow me to use university course codes in my <code>\st\y\abbr</code> class.
		That way, I don&apos;t have to look up what the names of the courses are any more and manually set the <code>title</code> property of the <code>&lt;span/&gt;</code> tags that relate to them.
		Basically, this update has an unintended consequence of entirely bypassing ...
	</p>
	<p>
		... the constructor.
		I just realized while typing how I need to fix that, and on that same note, <strong>*that*</strong> I need to fix it.
		So much for making good use of a new bug.
		I&apos;ve actually been looking for a way to set up the option to use <code>&lt;span/&gt;</code> tags instead of <code>&lt;abbr/&gt;</code> tags for certain use cases, but both a second class and outright adding that feature to the existing class would be overkill.

		I completed the ungraded quiz that I should have completed yesterday, then completed the second reading assignment and took <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/Strengths_weaknesses_opportunities_and_threats.xhtml">notes</a> that will help me later when I write the actual essay on the subject matter.
