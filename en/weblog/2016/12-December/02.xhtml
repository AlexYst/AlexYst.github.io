	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve learned what the strange graphical glitches are that my computer experiences when its battery nearly dies.
		Apperently, they&apos;re <abbr title="graphics processing unit">GPU</abbr> artifacts.
		I&apos;m told that they&apos;re caused by a problem with the physical <abbr title="graphics processing unit">GPU</abbr>, and as such, are a hardware problem.
		I have no hope of fixing them without rebooting.
		Until now, I&apos;ve been looking for leads as to how to deal with them without shutting down my machine and interrupting my work flow, but I guess that I can put those efforts to rest now, as efforts in that direction are futile.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		In my dream last night, the government was out to get me and I had to clear everything out of my apartment to throw out so that I could find the bare minimum that I needed and go back on the run.
		Man, I owned so much random junk!
		I have no idea where I got it all, why I had it, or how it all fit in the apartment.
		I had to be quick though so that I could be gone by the time that they;d be back to get me, later in the day.
		Meanwhile, other people that I didn&apos;t really know where trying to &quot;help&quot; me clear out my stuff, but they were only slowing me down.
		No matter how much I told them to let me work on my own, they wouldn&apos;t.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve worked the font that I completed yesterday into a form that can be used to output large Unicode-art-style lettering.
		Now, I just need to build a function that takes a Unicode art font and a string and outputs the string in the font.
		The main challenge with this will be supporting characters outside the <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> range.
		<abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> doesn&apos;t really treat bytes from multi-byte characters as being any different that single-byte characters, so I&apos;ll need to program multi-byte character support myself.
		My specific font doesn&apos;t support any multi-byte characters, and in fact, doesn&apos;t even support the full <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> range, but failing to provide support in my function would be a huge oversight.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I got another chunk of my reading assignment done, but I didn&apos;t complete it as planned.
		I can&apos;t exactly stay up late to finish either.
		While I have a closing shift tomorrow at work, so I can afford to sleep in in the morning, I open the next day.
		In other words, I can&apos;t afford to throw off my sleep schedule.
