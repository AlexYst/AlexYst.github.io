	<h2>General news</h2>

		Vanessa and our mother arrived home today.
		Apparently, Cyrus is now trying to claim that for all Eagle Scout projects, the scout&apos;s mother ends up being the sole driving force to get the project done.
		Without that, the scout doesn&apos;t put in the effort.
		Um.
		What?
		That&apos;s not what the project&apos;s supposed to be about.
		Also, Cyrus insists that they needed to sleep when asked to work on cleaning up our rented house in Coos Bay because they were hallucinating.
		This sleep cost the rest of us each seven hours according to our mother, and the fact that Cyrus claimed that they&apos;d emptied the cupboard but really hadn&apos;t cost us $400 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>, due to the landlords charging us for the extra days in which the dishes sat in the cupboard before they even found them and notifies us of them.
		I think that the seven hour cost was probably our trip back to Coos Bay to pick up those dishes.
		I had been on Cyrus&apos; side as far as needing to sleep, but trying to claim that the Eagle Scout project is always the responsibility of the mother isn&apos;t cool.
		I mean, it was my mother that wanted it done in this case, not Cyrus, but to claim that the scout themself isn&apos;t supposed to be driven at all on their own to complete the project in even more normal cases is a blatant lie.
		Our mother seems to honestly be done with Cyrus this time.
		It doesn&apos;t help either that Cyrus had our father and Vanessa pick them up in Portland today after Vanessa and our mother got home.
		Our mother wants Cyrus to have nothing to do with our father, and while I don&apos;t agree that our mother should be able to impose that on Cyrus, Cyrus did agree to stay away from our father and Cyrus should keep their own word.

		I really should have gotten more of my coursework done yesterday.
		I had so much free time that I likely could have completed <strong>*all*</strong> of the week&apos;s work, aside from the responses to other students on the discussion board, which will obviously have to wait until other students actually say something to respond to.
		Today though, I completed one more section of my reading assignment, then my <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/index.xhtml#Unit7">learning journal</a> entry.
		Again, I could have and should have gotten more done today, but at this point, it really doesn&apos;t matter.
		I only have one sixth of a chapter left to read, my ungraded quiz on the reading assignment, the essays that I need to grade, and the rest of the discussion assignment.
		All of the large work is done and taken care of, and I&apos;d say that I&apos;m even slightly ahead of schedule at the moment.
