	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="https://wowana.me./">Wowaname</a> got back to me, and confirmed that replacing the <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificates that I can access on the server will update what certificates the server uses for encryption next time that the server is restarted.
		Or rather, the update will occur next time that the server is instructed to rehash the configuration.
		I don&apos;t have the option to initiate that, so until wowaname happens to make a configuration change or the server is restart, the certificate won&apos;t be replaced.
		That&apos;s all the more reason that I need to get the certificate replaced as soon as time allows, as I don&apos;t want to miss the rehashing.
		I don&apos;t have time to mess with that today though.
		I could ask wowaname to rehash the configuration, but I&apos;d rather not be begging them to do more things for me than they already do by hosting my website.
	</p>
	<p>
		I took a walk to the street that supposedly has the tree with a sidewalk leading straight through its trunk.
		There is no evidence that such a tree existed there in the recent past.
		There&apos;s no tree, no stump, no anything.
		There is a large tree that looks similar to the one in the shift leader&apos;s photograph though.
		It has droopy branches that would have made it possible for a tunnel through the branches to be cut, as the branches could still be connected to the tree from above.
		Likewise, it looks like in the recent path, it might have had branches reaching all the way down to the sidewalk, though these have now been trimmed away, along with most of the branches touching the ground on the property as well.
		Long story short, not only was the trip disappointing in that there was no sidewalk through a tree trunk, but also in that I can&apos;t tell for sure if I found the tree that my shift leader saw, nor did I even get to see a tunnel through branches, which while nowhere near ad cook as a tunnel through a the trunk, would still be kind of cool.
	</p>
	<p>
		I love living in a city full of trees though.
		This tree wasn&apos;t as cool as described, but it was still a pretty tall tree, and there were countless trees that I passed on the way to it.
		It&apos;s easy to take them all for granted, but it truly is awesome living on this half of the state.
		Western Oregon sees a lot of rain, but it really greens up the place.
		Plant life here is everywhere, and you can&apos;t take even a short walk without seeing a few dozen trees.
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager emailed me today asking if I could cover an opening shift tomorrow.
		Apparently, one of the shift leaders (not the one with the tree photograph, but another that usually makes the dough in the mornings) has hurt their arm and can&apos;t come in tomorrow.
		Even if they could come in, cutting the dough requires a bit of arm strength.
		With an injured arm, dough-cutting would be painful.
		(I assume that their good arm is the one injured, but I could be wrong.) I don&apos;t have the details on how they hurt their arm or how badly, but the head manager asked me to take their place.
		There must be a second shift leader on duty that morning, as while I&apos;m authorized to make dough, I&apos;m not authorized to manage the store.
		Hopefully the shift leader is feeling better soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m considering writing a fantasy story.
		I considered setting it in the <a href="http://floraverse.com./">Floraverse</a> or <a href="https://peppercarrot.com/en/static3/webcomics">Pepper&amp;Carrot</a> universe, but those universes don&apos;t really meet my needs.
		Specifically, I&apos;m kind of adamant about having eight basic types of magic, represented by the eight basic colors (black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, yellow, and white).
		I&apos;m not even picky about what each type of magic does, but neither universe has this.
		The Floraverse universe has five main magic types, fifteen secondary magic types, and an unlimited number of very specialized magic types.
		I&apos;ve never seen anyone make use of the super-specialized types, as it&apos;s more useful to use a known set instead of building your own type of magic that only you ever use.
		Still, that leaves Floraverse with five, twenty, or an unlimited number of magics to work with, not the eight that I&apos;m looking for.
		Pepper&amp;Carrot&apos;s universe on the other hand, offers six types of magic.
		I think that I might use the magic of Floraverse and Pepper&amp;Carrot to draw inspiration for my own magic system though.
		As of writing this, I&apos;ve only come up with four of the eight magic types, and I&apos;m having trouble coming up with the other four.
		At first, I was going to release the story that I write under the <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> <abbr title="General Public License version Three or later">GPLv3+</abbr>, as it&apos;s textual.
		In general, I prefer to release text-based works, including source code and articles, under this license.
		However, I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that this license is too strict to support derivatives.
		After all, what if someone wants to create graphic art from it? This would require releasing the art&apos;s source code, and it&apos;s tricky to even know what the &quot;source code&quot; of a graphic image is.
		In some cases, it&apos;s quite obviously the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr> project file.
		However, without proper use of layers, source elements are effectively lost, which seems illegal according to the license.
		In other cases, a simpler image editor is used, no project file exists, and the source is destroyed as it&apos;s used.
		Again, bordering on illegal.
		Again, this seems to border on illegal.
		With this in mind, I decided to release the story instead under the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International">CC BY-SA 4.0</abbr> license, to sidestep the legal complications.
		Additionally, as <a href="https://creativecommons.org./share-your-work/licensing-considerations/compatible-licenses/"><abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International">CC BY-SA 4.0</abbr> is one-way compatible with the <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> <abbr title="General Public License version Three">GPLv3</abbr></a>, I don&apos;t have to jump through any hoops such as releasing parts of my page under <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr> and other parts of the same page under the <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> <abbr title="General Public License">GPL</abbr> when I release the story on my <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> <abbr title="General Public License version Three or later">GPLv3+</abbr>-licensed website.
	</p>
	<p>
		That all said, I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that while I want to write this story, I can&apos;t do it just yet.
		I still have about twelve opinionative essays to write, which are more important than goofy fantasy stories.
		I need to complete at least some of those before I begin my creative writing project.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I had a really strange dream.
		I was working in a high-security building and had accidentally tripped the security system, locking myself out of the most secure parts.
		Later, I was sent to retrieve some wire from a secure part of the building, but my superiors refused to reset the security system.
		Instead, they gave me a small, cylindrical, silver robot on wheels, about as small as could be gripped by both hands, and told to go through the space under the floor.
		I was instructed to have the robot drag me, as there was barely any space for me to lay down; I wouldn&apos;t have been able to move if not being dragged.
		I remember thinking that this was a huge hole in the security system that could have been exploited by people that, unlike me, weren&apos;t supposed to be there.
		Additionally, I thought that it was extremely lazy of the higher-ups to not simply reset the alarm so I wouldn&apos;t have to be dragged under the floor.
		The space under the floor was full of obstacles to avoid, such as support pillars and wasp traps, and once I got through to where the wire was, I saw a much nicer path that my superiors could have sent me through that didn&apos;t involve going under the floor and didn&apos;t even require resetting the security system.
		I retrieved the wire, though I later found out that I was supposed to allow the robot to drag me until the first day of the new calendar year, which would have put me in a different room with different wire.
		I had grabbed the wrong stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, premise of the dream changed.
		I was getting ready to go on vacation with my family.
		Strangely, both of my parents were involved, despite the fact that they&apos;re divorced in the real world and my mother hates my father.
		I didn&apos;t have time to pack though, as I had been under the floor being dragged by the small robot, and had to pack in a hurry.
		I didn&apos;t actually get to the packing though, as my father wanted to keep jabbering on about the vacation and some missing unflavored tortilla chips until it was time for us to leave.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also dreamed that the canonical spelling of the name of the Arby&apos;s restaurant was &quot;Arbys&apos;&quot;, not &quot;Arby&apos;s&quot;.
		With the apostrophe in the wrong place like that, I remembered wondering if there was more than one Arby and they all owned the restaurant.
		I even saw a photograph of the sign in my dream, verifying the location of the apostrophe.
		Upon awaking, I did a Web search verifying that this was not true; Arby&apos;s does have their apostrophe in the correct place.
		It&apos;s worth noting though that some restaurants are idiotic when it comes to their names.
		For example, Little Caesars Pizza doesn&apos;t have an apostrophe at all.
		They use the plural, non-possessive form of the word &quot;Caesar&quot;.
		Do they mean then that it&apos;s the Little Caesars (plural) that run the store, and not that Little Caesar (singular) owns it?

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I finally took the ungraded quiz for the week, which I usually take as soon as I complete the reading material.
		However, this week, I was extremely tired that day, and ended up putting it off.
		I had planned to get a lot more schoolwork done today as well, but I just wasn&apos;t feeling up to it.
