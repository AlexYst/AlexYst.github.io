	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I had a closing shift today, so I knew before I went in to work that I&apos;d be stationed at a register, most likely the drive-through till.
		Sure enough, that&apos;s where they put me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the grass has thawed out, though not even all of that has been deiced yet.
		All of the other plants are still covered in a thick layer of ice.
		Trees are groaning under the weight of the ice, branches are falling off, and the ice itself is squeaking as it attempts to bend toward gravity and take the trees with it.
		The power lines are coated in ice too.
		It first, I thought that I heard them buzzing from being stretched under the weight of the ice.
		The power has been flickering in the house, reflecting the stress that the power lines are under.
		However, I think that perhaps what I was hearing wasn&apos;t a buzz from the power lines, but a distant squeaking of the ice as the power lines moved in the wind.

		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I finished up my &quot;learning journal&quot; assignment, a task on developing goals through use of a &quot;strategy diamond&quot;:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/#Unit5">BUS 1101: Principles of Business Management</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I knew that I wouldn&apos;t have any time to work on coursework after work because of my closing shift, and there was no time before work to finish the assigned reading for the week.
		However, I can&apos;t allow myself to continue to lag behind in my studies.
		With that in mind, I graded the essay submissions from last week of the three students that I&apos;d been assigned this week.
		It&apos;s not the biggest task that I have this week, but it&apos;s something that I could squeeze into what time I had and something that didn&apos;t require having first read this week&apos;s learning materials.
