		<a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a> seems to have stopped maliciously discriminating against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users.
		This is awesome!
		Perhaps once I have more money, I&apos;ll start supporting another artist, such as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/davidrevoy">David Revoy</a>, the main author of <a href="https://peppercarrot.com/">Pepper&amp;Carrot</a>.

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I only got about five hours of sleep last night.
		At first, I felt fantastic anyway! I went to work early, made a pizza with some vegan cheese that I brought, then stopped by First Tech Federal Credit Union.
		They had sent me an advertisement for a credit card a while ago, and I&apos;m looking for a non-Discover credit card because apparently, Bandcamp&apos;s setup doesn&apos;t allow me to subscribe to European artists using a Discover credit card.
		However, First Tech refuses to issue a second card attached to my account under a different name, so that card isn&apos;t an option.
		Oh well.
	</p>
	<p>
		I headed back to work, ate breakfast (not the pizza), then started helping my coworkers set up for the day.
		I wasn&apos;t clocked on, but I had nothing better to do while I waited for my shift to come.
		Eventually, they offered to allow me to clock in an hour early if I also clocked out an hour early, so I agreed to that and got on the clock.
		Later, they wanted to allow someone with food poisoning to clock off early, so I picked up an extra hour and was to clock off at my originally-scheduled time.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few hours of working, I started to get very cold, then a bit later, I started losing my energy.
		I felt worse and worse until I realized that i was quite ill.
		It didn&apos;t help either that I never got my second break (which normally, I would have been just fine without).
	</p>
	<p>
		My mother picked me up after work, then we headed out of town in a rented moving van to grab a washing machine.
		We then cleared a path through my mother&apos;s junk, which fills the hallways, and I squeezed the washing machine through and set it up.
		It seems that it&apos;s a bit damaged.
		The lid of the machine has a broken hinge, and my mother&apos;s convinced that I&apos;m the one that broke it.
		I don&apos;t think that that&apos;s the case.
		There&apos;s also a dent nead the back, and I think that that one&apos;s actually my fault.
		I probably hit it against the dolly too hard.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not testing the machine tonight, but it sounds like my mother will.
		I need to rest though, I feel awful, so I went to bed.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I was doing coursework on a classroom from an overhead projector.
		It wasn&apos;t the most exciting dream, but it sure was realistic! My old glass and graphics teacher was the professor, and I had just transferred into the course partway through.
		Only three students were in the course though: myself, someone that I once knew in high school, and some third student that I didn&apos;t recognize.
		We each had a manilla folder with notebook paper bound in it with {{{those brace things}}}, which we were using as notebooks for our work.
		It was the same system that my glass and graphics teacher used in their real life course on glass and graphics for our daily overhead projector work.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I proofread and submitted my <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/Three_types_of_organizational_structures.xhtml">essay</a>.
		I had planned to start this week&apos;s coursework today, but I was feeling much too ill, so I went to bed instead.
