	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve put up a skeletal &quot;about&quot; page finally.
		I need to flesh it out more, but often times, simply not having the page already has prevented me from adding to it when I&apos;m thinking about something that should go there.
		That won&apos;t be an issue any more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Google wrote to me again, with a message saying that my old telephone number has been removed from the list of devices that messages and calls are forwarded to, but that if I add a new number or have other numbers associated with the account, forwarding can still be made to work again or is already still working with those other numbers.
		That doesn&apos;t answer my question that I&apos;ve had all along though about the <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>-to-email and voice-message-to-email that I actually use.
		I don&apos;t <strong>*want*</strong> <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages, voice messages, or voice calls forwarded to another number.
		I want them deposited in the <strong>*email inbox*</strong> of the same account.
		I even had the feature that forwards to another number disabled! I did a quick test with <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>, and found that at least that is still working.
		Until I hear otherwise, I might assume that the voice message system still works as before.
		Maybe I should test that at some point, but not today.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was dealing with stupid telephone stuff, I also used my SafeLink device to call itself.
		It didn&apos;t actually come through though, instead hitting the voice message system.
		Hopefully if the incoming call from before wasn&apos;t enough to qualify for the requirement that I make at least one call per month, this short call to the voice mail system will count.
		I really, <strong>*really*</strong> do not to call actual people.
		I hate telephone calls, and only have these numbers in place for situations in which I can&apos;t avoid dealing with someone and that someone demands that i be reachable via a telephone number.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that I lived as part of a small community, trapped within a surrounding wall and ceiling.
		The wall and ceiling were huge; among other things, we had a whole beach in there.
		We were immortal, though one of us couldn&apos;t feel anything.
		One day, three of us escaped, and it turned out that we had been ants trapped within one of those frozen treat freezers in a store.
		Though how did we have a warm beach inside a freezer? Dreams are strange.
		Later, it turned out that we were only characters in a movie, so I guess that that sort of explains the strangeness.
	</p>

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		The university sent me another email saying that they&apos;ve given me a Microsoft account with an email inbox attached.
		Because this email was a bit malformed and the last one wasn&apos;t, I thought that they&apos;d messed up and given everyone <strong>*two*</strong> accounts, with the second one having a &quot;name:&quot; prefix as part of the email address.
		However, this account that they notified me of today is the same account that they gave me a while back.
		I don&apos;t know what the deal is, but no further action is required on my part.
	</p>
	<p>
		I really didn&apos;t want to work on coursework today because of a headache, but I really should have completed everything before if I wanted to be able to justify not working on coursework now.
		Just to say that I got something done, I graded the other students&apos; essays from last week.
		Completing the reading assignment isn&apos;t feasible with a headache and completing the discussion assignment isn&apos;t possible until one more student posts.
		I&apos;ll complete the reading assignment tomorrow, and like respond to two classmate on the discussion board as well.
		If a third student has posted by then, I can fully complete my coursework for the week and have most of the next day off.
		At 21:00, the next week&apos;s work will be posted though, so I should start in on that at that time.
