<h2 id="general">General news</h2>
<p>
	My shift at work yesterday was awful.
	It could have been worse, but it was awful.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;m still very much sick today, but I feel better than I did yesterday.
	I&apos;m not as much better as I thought that I was at first though.
	It seems that if I stay on my feet too long, my symptoms come back to an extent.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
</p>
<h2 id="dreams">Dream journal</h2>
<p>
	I dreamed that I was working the drive-through at work, and a customer came by asking if we&apos;d allow them to use our telephone if they placed their order in our lobby instead of in the drive-through.
	I replied that we would, and to come on in.
	They asked me to double-check, but I refused, saying that they weren&apos;t the first customer to make such a request, so I know what our policy is.
	After they pulled away, I saw that half of our drivethrough was taken up by cars that were just using the space for parking.
	The people in those cars were dressed pretty fancily, and I thought that they were headed to see a play or something.
	I ended up going into the office in the back for some reason, and noticed that it had been cleaned.
	There was almost no clutter in it any more.
