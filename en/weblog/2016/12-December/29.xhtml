	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		The insurance people came by to take a look at Vivian&apos;s car, and it seems that that one&apos;s totalled too.
		That&apos;s two totalled vehicles in two months.
		Fun.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the hoses leading to the washing machine doesn&apos;t have a tight enough connection, so water sprays everywhere.
		Lovely.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve got a closing shift at work today.
		This could go really well, as it&apos;ll be an easy shift, or it could go really poorly, because I&apos;m not feeling well at all.
		In any case, I&apos;m not going to want to write my journal entry when I get home, so I&apos;m writing it up before I head into work.
		I really want some orange juice, so I might pick some up as I head in.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure if this was a dream or if it was mild hallucinations, but I kept waking up in the middle of the night thinking that I&apos;d found proof that there are only three ways to do something or another and that things will always turn out the same because they&apos;re designed to always come out the same, whatever that means.
	</p>

<section id="university">
	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I read over the main assignments that I have this week, and I really should have stayed up and gotten started on my coursework last night, despite feeling very ill.
		It seems that part of the <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/#Unit8">learning journal</a> assignment this week involves tracking which days I&apos;ve completed which parts of the unit.
		Now I&apos;m going to have to admit to getting nothing done yesterday.
		I won&apos;t be writing any more about my coursework this week in my journal, as it&apos;ll all be in my learning journal instead, so pop on over to that if you&apos;re interested.

<section id="docmod">
	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
