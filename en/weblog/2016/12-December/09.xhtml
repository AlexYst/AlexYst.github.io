	<h2>Unsponsored advertisements</h2>
	<p>
		I found a great artist that produces electronic music on Bandcamp, <a href="http://kubbimusic.com./">Kubbi</a>.
		From the sound of their profile, they specialize in 8-bit music, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case at all after listening to some of their albums.
		I tried to <a href="https://kubbi.bandcamp.com/subscribe">subscribe</a> to their Bandcamp page, but Bandcamp is strangely declining my card.
		The one-dollar, temporary, test charges are coming through, so I know that the problem is on Bandcamp&apos;s end, not Discover&apos;s.
		If Discover was declining the purchase, the temporary test charges would be declined.

	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been getting a lot of <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> 403 errors on the Bandcamp website, and it has me worried.
		I figured that I&apos;d better speak up now before it gets bad, so I wrote this letter to Bandcamp:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Today, yesterday, and the day before, I&apos;ve been getting a lot of HTTP 403 (Forbidden) errors across the Bandcamp website.
			Sometimes I&apos;ll be trying to browse through albums, and I&apos;ll get blocked.
			Sometimes I&apos;ll be managing my profile in some way and get blocked.
		</p>
		<p>
			I&apos;ve had this happen in the past, but never more than once in a month.
			Now, it&apos;s happening several times each day.
			It seems that Tor exit nodes are being blocked more frequently.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the current rate of HTTP 403 errors, things are still very manageable, but the sudden increase in page blocks has me worried.
			Mainly, I&apos;d just like to express my concern.
			I greatly hope that you don&apos;t plan to completely block the Tor proxy network that I use to connect to the Web.
			I have sixty-nine albums in my collection and four individual tracks.
			I don&apos;t have any other way to reach Bandcamp, and I&apos;d really hate to lose my investment.
		</p>
	</blockquote>

		I worked a closing shift at work today, so they put me on a register.
		They put me on the drive-through window register, to be specific.
		For some reason, they never have me work the front counter ...
		In any case, everyone seems to complain about working the drive-through window, but I don&apos;t mind it.
		I admit that working at the drive-though window was nicer before the headsets were implemented, and the headsets are the main thing that my coworkers complain about, but even now, working at the drive-through window isn&apos;t bad.
		I&apos;d rather be on a till than be elsewhere in the store.
	</p>
	<p>
		There were a couple of issues with stupid people at work today though.
		First, a customer got angry that after seeing &quot;see ID&quot; written on the back of their credit card, I asked to see their <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		Why did they write that there if they didn&apos;t want people verifying that the real card holder was the one using the card? Later, as I was going on break, I asked one of my coworkers to leave the Parmesan off of one order of bread sticks.
		Normally, I prepare my own breads, but between dealing with customers and the fact that a coworker was already preparing all of the breads that had left the oven, I had to ask them to avoid finishing the one set of bread sticks all the way.
		After the customer that I was helping left, they brought me the breads, asking if I still wanted the cheese, just not the Parmesan.
		They had left off the soy butter, but added the Parmesan cheese! For some reason, they thought that Parmesan was the butter!
	</p>
	<p>
		On my breaks, I type little notes to myself to remind me later of what happened throughout the day.
		That way, I can make my journal entries as complete as possible.
		Replicant&apos;s default auto-correct settings have never hindered me before, but today, they did.
		In fact, I thought that Replicant&apos;s default setting was to have auto-correct turned off, but apparently, it&apos;s actually &quot;moderate&quot; automatic corrections.
		So I shut auto-correct off entirely.
		Otherwise, my notes to myself wouldn&apos;t have made sense today.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		I received a response from my program advisor, who seems somehow happy that I&apos;m struggling in my course.
		That&apos;s ...
		not very nice.
		They also commented on my email signature though (which contains my <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> key <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> and fingerprint), saying that they&apos;ve been in information security for a decade, so they understand symmetric and asymmetric encryption, including how to use <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> keys, but that the staff at the university don&apos;t use email encryption at the school.
		That&apos;s understandable.
		The school probably wants to be able to hold their staff accountable for what they say.
		Likewise, the staff wants to be able to debunk any false claims that they said anything wrong.
		It&apos;s all about auditing and logs.
		However, it&apos;s awesome that my program advisor at least knows about <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr>! Most people don&apos;t seem to.
	</p>
	<p>
		I completed the chapter reading for the week, though it seemed to drag on.
		I swear, I don&apos;t have the mindset for business.
		I was planning to take the ungraded quiz today, but there simply was no time.
