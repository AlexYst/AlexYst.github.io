		I managed to cut two pixels off the top of the font that I built <a href="https://y.st./en/weblog/2016/11-November/17.xhtml">the other day</a>.
		I&apos;m almost certain that I can&apos;t cut off any of the width because I need at least five pixels for wide characters such as em and double-u.
		The commercial at sign pretty much locks my hight requirements as well.
		That means that this font won&apos;t be getting any smaller!

		It seems that SafeLink Wireless takes back unused calling minutes, though not right away.
		The twenty-six minutes that I had left of the thirty that the device started with have disappeared.
		I still have the five hundred that were sent to the device when I activated the line, which is about five hundred more than I plan to use, but it&apos;s worth noting that you can&apos;t stockpile your minutes like you can of Tracfone proper.

		I had wholly intended to finish my reading assignment for the day, write my initial discussion post, and take the ungraded quiz, but I ended up only partially completing the reading assignment.
		Instead of completing my homework, I went looking at apartments.
		There was time for schoolwork when I got back, I just didn&apos;t have the energy.
		I don&apos;t think that I can make much progress on apartment hunting tomorrow, so I&apos;ll probably try to focus on schoolwork then instead.

	<h2>Apartment hunting</h2>
	<p>
		I lost track of how many apartment complexes I checked on R Street today after work, but it was at least fourteen.
		Unfortunately, not even one of them had a main office on the premises.
		I&apos;m starting to think that perhaps it&apos;s strange when they <strong>*do*</strong> have a main office on-site, but honestly, it seems really strange that they don&apos;t.
		I talked to a resident at one complex, and they said that it has no main office because it&apos;s privately owned.
		How do they find people to rent to then? Or does that mean that the residents themselves are the owners of the property? I have no idea.
		At another complex, I talked to a resident who told me that the main office is somewhere else in town, though they couldn&apos;t tell me where.
		They said that the property manager is Hacsa, so when time allows, I&apos;ll look them up and try to find contact information.
		Another complex had a sign saying that it was managed by Metco, so again, I&apos;ll look them up and try to get contact information when time allows.
		Lastly, one complex had a couple of signs advertising vacancies, but there was no main office on-site and no information about who the property manager is.
		I&apos;m not sure what to do about that.
