	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		The user that had trouble with Links on my website tested the website in the latest version now.
		As it turns out, the bug relating to treating <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> has already been fixed! There&apos;s nothing for me to try to figure out on my end.
		At some point though, when time allows, I need to compile the latest version of Links myself and see if its other major bugs have been fixed yet.
		If not, I need to report them so that hopefully they <strong>*will*</strong> get fixed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was thinking about how my shift today wouldn&apos;t be fun.
		I&apos;m would be spending my breaks reading from the boring textbook of the course that I&apos;m in.
		However, I quickly realized that I would have a closing shift today.
		Sure, my breaks wouldn&apos;t be fun, but my work for the day would be very easy and enjoyable.
		I&apos;d be wearing the crown of voices and washing dishes for most of the day, then I&apos;d be mopping up the back room just before leaving.
	</p>
	<p>
		As it turned out though, I spaced it and forgot to read the textbook on my breaks.
		I need to try to read the entire chapter tomorrow then, I suppose.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I was getting close to heading to work, I learned that my mother car wreck.
		This time, it was another driver, but like last time, it was because the other party jumped out in front of my mother.
		Strangely enough, this happened exactly thirty days after <a href="/en/weblog/2016/11-November/22.xhtml">their last wreck</a>.
		This time, the car (which my mother is borrowing from Vivian) still seems to be in full working order, as I understand it.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>University life</h2>
	<p>
		My program advisor responded letting me know that <span title="Ethics and Social Responsibility">PHIL 1404</span> is indeed a required course for all majors, and they&apos;ve let the Office of Student Services know so that they can fix the error.
		Sweet! In more ways than one, too.
		I prefer that bugs get fixed, I have a clear second course that I can take, and a course on ethics is required for all students at the university.
		Too few people seem to be concerned with ethics and ethical decisions.
		Now, the question is this: will the course actually teach good ethics, ethics that are good for the masses?
		Or will it instead teach bad ethics, ethics that involve screwing over the masses in the name of massive profit-making?
		The course description had this to say:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			This course explores Western and non-Western approaches to ethical reasoning, and the social implications of unethical behavior.
			Current professional ethics as well as cultural values will be analyzed, and students will be asked to reconcile these with personal beliefs in order to prepare them for taking responsibility for their actions in the world.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Huh.
		It doesn&apos;t tell me what I&apos;m wanting to know, but it does sound like it&apos;s more likely to be good.
		After all, it involves taking responsibility for one&apos;s own actions.
		Then again, that&apos;s sort of what ethics are about, even warped ethics.
		In any case, it should be very interesting learning about the views on ethics from very different places in the world.
		It might change the way that I view the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that I&apos;ve registered for <span title="Ethics and Social Responsibility">PHIL 1404</span> and am now in two courses next term, the school website is saying that I have two open course slots.
		That means that I can take a total of <strong>*four*</strong> courses if I choose to.
		I can&apos;t take on that heavy of a load though.
		I&apos;m sticking with just the two courses.
	</p>
	<p>
		I really wanted to finish my <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/index.xhtml#Unit6">learning journal entry</a> yesterday, but that didn&apos;t happen.
		As I was working on putting my thoughts from yesterday into words today, I realized one of the goals that I should have decided on: I need to get my <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> node back up! I was having a difficult time deciding which of my five existing goals to drop, so I ended up not dropping any.
		The assignment was to choose four or five goals, but I either can&apos;t count or can&apos;t follow directions.
		I went with six goals.
		I keep having to complete my learning journal entries at the last minute, but it&apos;s not from lack of effort.
		I pour a lot of thought into them, and I end up with very long learning journal entries much of the time, especially in this course.
		Today&apos;s entry was certainly no exception.
		Hopefully the long entries aren&apos;t a pain for my professor to grade.
		Personally though, when I&apos;m grading essays, I prefer the long ones over the short ones.
		The short essays are ...
		disappointing.
		The long ones show effort, and often times even make me think.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span> has had more essays and more learning journal entry assignments than either of the other courses that I&apos;ve taken here at the university.
		We&apos;ve had an essay every week without exception and a learning journal entry assignment every week except for one.
		That&apos;s not a bad thing, I&apos;d much rather have written work such as this than discussion assignments and tests.
		Discussion assignments are a pointless waste of time for me, as I don&apos;t really learn much from that format.
		Tests here at University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> don&apos;t provide any feedback as to what I got right and wrong, so while they measure what I know, they don&apos;t help me learn more and improve.
		That said, we&apos;ve had a discussion assignment every week too.
	</p>
	<p>
		Huh.
		I wonder if that&apos;s part of why this course has been a struggle for me.
		I mean, obviously, it&apos;s the wrong course for me.
		I&apos;m a computer science major and this is a business course.
		That means that I not only don&apos;t have the aptitude for this, this also isn&apos;t where my interests lie, making it harder to keep my mind on the work and harder to wrap my head around the concepts.
		But the workload is also heavier.
		I hadn&apos;t noticed that.
		Maybe I&apos;m not doing as poorly as I&apos;d thought, especially considering the unstable situation that I&apos;m living in right now.

	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2017/11-November/02.xhtml">2017-11-02</a>, this journal page was modified in order to redact the name of the university and a link to their website.
	</p>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
