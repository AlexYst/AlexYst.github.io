	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		My mother now insisted that I attempt to switch shifts with one of the employees opening the restaurant tomorrow.
		If I succeeded, I&apos;d have my closing shift tonight, then an opening shift in the morning.
		I&apos;d be tired through my whole shift, then tired through the whole day.
		Even if I managed to find time for a nap, I&apos;d likely still be exhausted, unproductive, and in a silently foul mood.
		I was going to walk in to do as my mother had requested, but they insisted that they drive me over, much to my dismay.
		They claimed that they did it for a speedy response as to if it worked out, but they waited about an hour before taking me.
		I could have been there and back on foot in that time.
		In any case, one of the openers tomorrow was there, but didn&apos;t want to switch shifts, two are shift leaders so I can&apos;t cover their shifts, and two were not responding via telephone.
		I love it when telephoning doesn&apos;t work out on the rare occasion that I even have to pick up a telephone.
		I don&apos;t mean that sarcastically, either.
		If I&apos;m required to use a telephone, then in most cases, I want it to fail.
		If I&apos;m desperate, as is the case with my apartment search, then I want it to work out well, but otherwise, any chance to say that telephones got me nowhere is a slight compensation for the fact that I even had to try using them.
		That said, I did honestly try to get my shift traded.
	</p>
	<p>
		With me unable to switch shifts, Vanessa and our mother took off for Gresham early.
		Instead of spending tomorrow fulfilling social obligations with relatives in my extended family that I barely know, I&apos;ll be here at home actually getting my coursework done.
	</p>
	<p>
		My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

		My plan for the day was to read my entire assigned chapter of the <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span> course textbook.
		I didn&apos;t do that though.
		Instead, I read the first two sections of the chapter, then noticed that the third section is the section that specifically deals with our <a href="/en/coursework/BUS1101/Three_types_of_organizational_structures.xhtml">essay assignment</a> for the week.
		What an awesome excuse to take a break from the textbook!
		I read the third section, then began my essay submission.
		It&apos;s mostly complete, but it does need a bit more information added.
		After adding that information tomorrow, I&apos;ll continue reading the textbook.
