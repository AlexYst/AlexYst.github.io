	<h2>General news</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t get as mush sleep last night as I&apos;d like to have, but I feel much more well-rested than yesterday.
		Today was an easier day.
		It also didn&apos;t hurt that today was a slow day at work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today at work, the shift leader that had breast implants was on duty.
		As <a href="/en/weblog/2016/12-December/03.xhtml#general">predicted</a>, I can&apos;t tell the difference.
		Our work uniforms aren&apos;t exactly the most form-fitting clothing, but I can&apos;t help but feel that my total obliviousness to all things sexual also plays a part.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was munching some cashews at work and managed to jam a fragment of one of the nuts really hard into a hole in one of my teeth.
		The light in the restroom doesn&apos;t function unless it&apos;s been warmed up, so I wasn&apos;t able to see well enough to use the mirror to dig the fragment out.
		I had to leave the fragment alone, which made for a highly-painful few hours.
		Eventually, I was able to jostle the nut piece out by sloshing liquid through my mouth, but it&apos;s not an experience that I want to repeat.
		Once I find my own apartment and some of my time frees up, I really need to update my Oregon Health Plan information and schedule a dental appointment.
		Speaking of my Oregon Health Plan coverage, I still haven&apos;t had time to send those people the copy of my tax returns that they requested ...
	</p>
	<p>
		The shift leader with the new implants asked one of the other employees to move some thirty-pound cheese boxes, complaining that they couldn&apos;t lift heavy objects themself because of their recent cosmetic surgery.
		I jokingly asked them whose fault that was, so they smiled and flipped me off! A bit later, they flipped me off again, I think just to make sure that I saw it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today was pay day, so I took the opportunity to take my paycheck down to the credit union.
		On the way, a coworker offered me a ride, but I&apos;ve learned my lesson about accepting rides.
		I turned them down, as I have no proof that they were actually headed where I needed to go and were not just going to take a detour to help me out.
		While in the area, I first stopped at the T-Mobile store, which is in the same small building as the credit union.
		I tried to pay my bill, but I didn&apos;t have the telephone number on the account.
		I had made sure to type the number into my mobile, but I had left my mobile at work!
		By the time I walked back to work and returned to the credit union, the credit union would be closed, so I finished my business there before heading back.
		There was quite a line, but it didn&apos;t take as long to get through as it looked like it would.
	</p>
	<p>
		I headed back to work, hoping that I had in fact left the mobile there, as opposed to having dropped it out of my pocket on the way or something, and that a coworker hadn&apos;t pocketed it.
		Honestly, most people would be disappointed by my device after finding that it has poor battery life, no bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, and no Google Play Store, but they wouldn&apos;t know that until after they stole it and my last Replicant device <strong>*did*</strong> get stolen.
		One can never bee too paranoid.
		On the way there, the cold really set in hard.
		I don&apos;t recall the cold being this bad two years ago.
		(Last year, I was in a different city with a different climate, but two years ago, I was here in this city.) I can&apos;t help but wonder whether climate change is involved, though it&apos;s possible that this year&apos;s winter is just not one of the warmer winters.
		Luckily, when I made it back to work, I was able to locate the device.
		It wasn&apos;t somewhere that I think that I&apos;d have put it, but it was there and is now back with me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Back at the T-Mobile store, while waiting in line, I noticed a sign saying that T-Mobile has a commitment to net neutrality.
		What a joke.
		Unlike Verizon and <abbr title="American Telephone and Telegraph">AT&amp;T</abbr>, T-mobile hasn&apos;t taken any legal actions attacking net neutrality, at least as far as I know.
		However, they have made statements that they don&apos;t think that the <abbr title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</abbr> should enforce the net neutrality rules and they <strong>*are*</strong> violating the spirit of net neutrality, even if not technically violating the rules laid out by the <abbr title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</abbr>.
		For one thing, they participate in something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Zero-rating">zero-rating</a>, which means that they treat data packets differently not by slowing some of them down, but by counting them against customers&apos; data connection plans while not counting other data packets against the same plans.
		Likewise, T-Mobile has a policy of lowering video quality on some plans, with no way to disable that antifeature.
		They are treating video data as different than other data by lossily shrinking the video size.
		Don&apos;t get me wrong, I think that T-Mobile is the best of the main carriers that we have here in the United States, but they still have many issues and should not claim to be supporting net neutrality.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got to the front of the line and was paying my mobile bill, the T-Mobile representative charged me for an extra fee: an E911 fee.
		Why are they charging me an E911 fee for a data-only plan? I can&apos;t even use <a href="tel:911;phone-context=+1">911</a>, as there&apos;s no calling features! The representative that was helping me claimed that that fee has always been there, despite my never having seen it before.
		However, another representative corrected them, saying that they added that fee to prepaid plans, including prepaid data-only plans, about a year ago.
		I haven&apos;t seen it because I was outside T-Mobile&apos;s coverage area this past year and had to use the only other <abbr title="Global System for Mobile Communications">GSM</abbr> carrier in the state.
		It looks like there&apos;s no avoiding this fee though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tired and cold, I stopped for dinner before heading home.
		Recently, the restaurant that I used to buy nachos at sometimes, Carl&apos;s Junior (Why is it not called &quot;Carl Junior&apos;s&quot;?), changed their menu a bit and shrank their nacho orders while keeping the price the same.
		Since then, both times that I ordered nachos without cheese and without sour cream, they have given me nachos with melted cheese.
		I&apos;ve sent these back and had them fix them, partially because I&apos;m allergic to dairy and partially because the thought of eating cow excretions is disgusting, but mostly hoping that they&apos;d get the message and stop adding cheese when I ask for it to be left off.
		Today though, I made sure to explain what has happened in the past before the nachos were made, to try to prevent the problem.
		After all, I&apos;m vegan because animal products are hard on the environment.
		If they waste the cheese, it doesn&apos;t matter whether I eat it or not; the damage is done either way.
		The cashier explained why they keep doing this.
		Apparently, they lack the option on their computer to leave the cheese off since they changed the menu.
		Unless I want to struggle with this situation every time, explaining again and again that I want <strong>*all*</strong> of the cheese left off, not just one type of cheese left off, my only real option is to stop eating there.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems that <a href="http://thedarkpiano.com/">Myuu</a> released their holiday album two days ago, but I didn&apos;t notice because I closed my email client.
		If you&apos;re looking for holiday music with an eerie piano twist, <a href="https://myuu.bandcamp.com/album/dark-christmas-music">Dark Christmas Music</a> might be the album for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve written up this website&apos;s first JavaScript code today, which makes navigating between pages in a series possible by using the left and right arrow keys.
		For now, it only has any effect on journal-related pages that aren&apos;t the main index, but if any future pages have a clear and specified order, it should work there as well.
		For those of you that hate nonfree JavaScript programs, the code is released under the same <abbr title="GNU&apos;s Not Unix">GNU</abbr> <abbr title="General Public License version Three or later">GPLv3+</abbr> that the rest of the text-based components of this website are.
		For those of you that don&apos;t want to use JavaScript at all and feel that navigation should be done using basic <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> code, the JavaScript actually pulls the required <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s for page transitions from <code>&lt;a/&gt;</code> tags in the source code of the page.
		With JavaScript disabled in your Web browser, navigation is still as easy as it was before this change.
		The JavaScript code used is extremely trivial and not at all necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://wowana.me./">Wowaname</a> has been on one of the same networks that I&apos;m on for a couple days, so I took the opportunity today to ask them about my website&apos;s <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate.
		Apparently, it&apos;s expired, which is the perfect opportunity to replace it with one that&apos;s signed by a &quot;trusted&quot; certificate &quot;authority&quot;.
		I don&apos;t buy into the certificate &quot;authority&quot; system, but further learning about how <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificates work has rendered continued resistance mostly pointless in my mind.
		I wouldn&apos;t use a certificate &quot;authority&quot; before because they charge a ridiculous price for wildcard certificates.
		I own the whole domain, including its subdomains.
		Why shouldn&apos;t I be able to secure the whole thing? Getting a wildcard certificate therefore requires that I use a self-signed certificate.
		However, it seems that wildcard <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificates don&apos;t work the same way that wildcard <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> does.
		A certificate good for <code>*.y.st.</code> would match <code>//example.y.st.</code>, but would <strong>*not*</strong> match <code>//example.example.y.st.</code>! To match my entire domain, I&apos;d need a long list of wildcard addresses, one for each potential domain level.
		That&apos;s one hundred twenty-six names, one of which has no wildcard components in it at all.
		Clearly, my desired solution isn&apos;t one that the <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> specification was built to handle.
		If I get a &quot;trusted&quot; certificate, at least idiots that can&apos;t figure out how <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> &quot;errors&quot; work will be able to reach my website.
		Seriously though, if Web browsers are going to complain about self-signed certificates, they should at the very least complain even more when no certificate is presented <strong>*at all*</strong>.
		Web browsers foolishly make unencrypted <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> look somehow safer than <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr> with self-signed certificates.
		Wowaname hasn&apos;t responded yet, but maybe later.
		I&apos;m hoping that I can make the certificate swap myself, though I don&apos;t know if the certificates that I can reach on wowaname&apos;s server are the ones used by the Web server or if they are just lingering copies.
		Once I know, I&apos;ll know if I can replace my website&apos;s certificate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, I&apos;m going to try to find the tree with the sidewalk through it.
		With any luck, the sidewalk passes right through the trunk as promised.
		A more likely situation though is that the sidewalk passes right <strong>*beside*</strong> the trunk, with the branches just trimmed away to allow passage.
		I&apos;m trying not to get my hopes up too high, but at the same time, it&apos;d be really cool if the tree is as advertised.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten my work uniforms soaking in the bathtub, but I&apos;m too tired to finish cleaning them tonight.
		After I go take a look at the tree, I&apos;ll probably finish washing my uniforms and perhaps get a load on non-uniform laundry started.
