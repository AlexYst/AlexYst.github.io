	I have run into another issue with the spider.
	This time, it is indexing <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s that are identical aside from session <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s as separate pages, then requesting each of these pages to search for hyperlinks on.
	Technically, this is the correct behavior, but in practice, this is both a waste of my disk space and the other server&apos;s resources.
	I kind of wonder if the logs will be read and the server administrator will think that it was some sort of attempted <abbr title="distributed denial-of-service">DDoS</abbr> attack.
	After all, the spider did just request the same page potentially hundreds of times.
	I need to add a feature that reads and parses the query string of <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s that it finds.
	I can then tell it to strip out certain variables, such as <code>sid</code>.
</p>
<p>
	I found a function that is impossible for me to map correctly to an object method: <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.fscanf.php"><code>\fscanf()</code></a>.
	The problem is that it takes an unlimited number of arguments that are passed be reference.
	I ended up having to include only the minimal functionality.
</p>
<p>
	Cyrus looked into another option for his Boy Scout project, this time, work at a cat shelter.
	However, it turns out that the work that they want done is illegal.
	They want a wall torn down so that a door can be installed, which is all well and good, but they want to do it on the down low so that they can avoid getting a permit for it.
	Even if Cyrus wanted to help them out, he would never get it approved as his project.
	The project needs to be completely legal.
