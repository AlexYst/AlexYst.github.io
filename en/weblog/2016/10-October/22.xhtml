	I couldn&apos;t get to sleep very well last night.
	By the time that I could drift off, I had to be up in four hours, so I spent the day in a very tired state.
</p>
<p>
	Most of today was spent on the road, so I wasn&apos;t able to get any schoolwork done.
	My mother and I stopped at Vivian and Cyrus&apos; apartment, where I expected that I&apos;d have time to get done a little of my reading assignment for the week, but that didn&apos;t go as planned.
	Cyrus, Vivian, and especially our mother were engaged in a very noisy conversation, so I couldn&apos;t actually focus on the sentences that I was trying to read.
	We washed our laundry while we were there, seeing as our own washing machine leaks.
	There wasn&apos;t time to dry all of our clothing though, so we ended up taking some of that home damp.
</p>
<p>
	We headed to a gasoline station, where my mother had me hop out of the car to pay the bill.
	They said that they&apos;d be on the pump up ahead, so I went on and paid for pump nine, the one up ahead.
	However, my mother instead ended up at pump eleven.
	My mother was furious, claiming that I should have used &quot;common sense&quot; to know that they didn&apos;t mean the pump up ahead like they&apos;d said, but that they instead meant some other pump.
	They explained why I &quot;should&quot; have known, and it wasn&apos;t an issue of &quot;common sense&quot; at all.
	Basically, my mother&apos;s been driving and filling at gasoline stations for decades.
	My mother knows the traffic patterns at that type of place.
	I don&apos;t drive though.
	I&apos;m against the burning of fossil fuels.
	My mother always expects everyone to have the same experiences as them, but we each experience different things.
	I think that next time that my mother can&apos;t figure out a basic computer concept that even an elementary school child would know, I&apos;m going to see how they like the &quot;common sense&quot; card, because quite frankly, I&apos;m tired of it.
	Every time my mother claims that anyone, myself included, lacks &quot;common sense&quot;, the actual situation is that either my mother&apos;s dead wrong, so my mother&apos;s &quot;common sense&quot; is dead wrong, or the situation calls for experience that the other person doesn&apos;t necessarily have.
	To complicate things at the gasoline station, the person at the pump that I&apos;d payed for got over-filled.
	They instructed the pump attendant to put ten dollars worth of gasoline in the tank, but they instead put twenty-two, which came out of the funds that I&apos;d handed over.
	They refused to pay for more than the ten dollars worth of fuel that they&apos;d asked for, but I had to get back the correct change for my mother.
	The other person ended up walking away with twelve dollars worth of fuel gratis.
	I tried to check over the receipt to make sure that we hadn&apos;t covered the extra twelve dollars, but my mother said that the change was correct without even seeming to look it over, and rushed us out.
	If my mother finds it to be incorrect later, it is no longer my fault or problem.
</p>
<p>
	Just as it was getting dark, we stopped by our grandparent&apos;s house.
	My mother&apos;s parent asked about why I grew a beard, so my mother piped up that I&apos;m just too lazy to shave.
	That&apos;s not at all the case though, as I do shave off my mustache.
	I of course defended myself, explaining the real situation.
	I prefer the beard.
	It draws attention away from my scalp hair, though I didn&apos;t mention that part.
	Furthermore, when I do shave my beard, it causes pimples to pop up like crazy under my chin.
	Cyrus brought up that they have the same problem, though they prefer the pimples over a beard on their own chin.
	My mother got ticked off about this though, saying that I had never told them that.
	We never talk though.
	The thing is, my mother gets strange whenever I talk about anything that I even remotely care about, so I don&apos;t talk much to them.
	After all, if I can&apos;t even ever talk about important things, what&apos;s the point of the conversation? Likewise, when I do talk, my mother likes to frequently interrupt so I almost never get to finish my story.
	What&apos;s the point in even starting? Furthermore, my mother doesn&apos;t like my beard.
	Why would I randomly start talking to them about it? Anyway, my mother&apos;s parent is odd, senile, and has many of the quirks that my mother has.
	However, my mother complains about these quirks in their own parent, denying that they have them themself.
	Their parent also doesn&apos;t seem to be able to answer simple questions, and jumps to random topics.
	This drives my mother batty, and though I&apos;m not affected by it much myself because I&apos;m not very emotionally invested, I can easily see why my mother is frustrated with them.
</p>
<p>
	My mother says that I should get my old pizza-making job back while they try to find a place for us to move.
	I&apos;ve been wanting to get back to work, to be honest, but I feel trapped; I can&apos;t stay for long.
	Once we move, I need to quit.
	With my mother having recommended it though, I can&apos;t really be blamed by the two-week delay needed before I can go after having put in a two-weeks notice.
	I&apos;ll probably try to get that job back after I finish this week&apos;s schoolwork.
	I&apos;m a bit further behind than I should be, so a few more days to sort that out would be nice.
	I&apos;m frustrated that I will be departing so soon after hire, as I&apos;ve been told that it looks bad to quit before six months of employment have elapsed, but I&apos;m also frustrated to be running very short on money and still having loans to pay off.
	Employment of nearly any kind is preferable to lack of employment right now.
</p>
<p>
	We arrived home past midnight.
	By this time, I think that I might have been slightly delirious.
	I really wish that sleep came a bit easier.

		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
