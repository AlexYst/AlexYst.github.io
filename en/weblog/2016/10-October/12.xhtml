	My GT-i9100M went back to refusing to shut off again.
	I thought that I was going to go out and get a screwdriver after all, but by the time it came to that, that problem had gone away again.
	Having formatted my <code>/data</code> partition while trying to fix things, <a href="file:///storage/sdcard0/"><code>/storage/sdcard0/</code></a> had become read-only and I couldn&apos;t seem to find a way to fix it.
	It seemed that <code>/storage/sdcard0/</code> was supposed to be a symbolic link to <a href="file:///data/media/0/"><code>/data/media/0/</code></a>, but for some reason, it had become a regular directory.
	Of course, the directory that that directory was in was on a read-only file system, so that had made <code>/storage/sdcard0/</code> read-only as well.
	I tried deleting that directory and replacing it with the symbolic link, but after rebooting, my changes would always be reverted.
	All the while, while dealing with both the file system issue and the inability to shut off the device, the GT-i9100M kept complaining that it didn&apos;t like the file system formatting on the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.
	Strangely, it was still reading the files on the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card, despite saying that the card was unreadable.
	I assumed that it was yet another problem that the device was having, but eventually, just to shut the thing up, I agreed to allow it to format the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.
	I figured that I&apos;d fix the formatting back to Ext4 later.
	However, upon agreeing to allow the device to format the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card, a miraculous thing occurred.
	The device fixed the file system issues with the internal storage! The device had no problem with the actual <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.
	It had been asking permission to fix itself! It was due to Google&apos;s confusing naming of the internal storage as the &quot;<abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card&quot; that had effectively created a language barrier between my device and me.
	Oddly, this cleared up the shut down issue as well, at least for now.
	I might still go out to get a screwdriver in case this sort of thing happens again, but the day to do that isn&apos;t today.
</p>
<p>
	By the way, I&apos;ve also located some physical damage on the device&apos;s battery.
	I&apos;m told that a malfunctioning battery could potentially somehow prevent the device from shutting off, and though the only damage that I can see is to the plastic case on the end of the battery, it&apos;s a sign that there&apos;s been some sort of impact on the battery.
	Something inside may be damaged as well.
</p>
<p>
	I went over the paragraphs accompanying my <a href="https://y.st./en/coursework/UNIV1001/Notes.xhtml">notes on nuclear energy</a> and made some corrections, but I didn&apos;t go over the notes themselves.
	I also reread my essay on <a href="https://y.st./en/coursework/POLS1503/The_Canadian_Magazine_Dispute_and_an_Exemption_for_Whaling.xhtml">the Canadian magazine dispute and the attempts to get an exception for the global whaling ban</a> and touched that up a bit.
	Both were due today, so after making these last-minute changes, I submitted them.
	I also found that the University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> submission form has an option to allow direct <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> input, so starting today, I&apos;m going to make heavy use of that.
	I already have to format my work in <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> before uploading it to my own website, so why format it a second time for the University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> website if I don&apos;t have to? Additionally, <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> is much easier to control than the main submission form&apos;s formatting capabilities.
	Until today, I&apos;ve been using LibreOffice Writer to format my essays, then copying them and pasting them into the submission form.
	The submission form, for the most part, takes the formatting from LibreOffice without issue.
	However, it seems that when pasting something that&apos;s been indented with spaces, most of the spaces are lost.
	This only happens when pasting something from LibreOffice Writer though; it doesn&apos;t happen when pasting something from <a href="apt:geany">Geany</a>.
	Also, as I already knew, pasting something containing tab characters causes <strong>*all*</strong> tab characters to be removed.
	Being able to write up my submissions in <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> will prevent a lot of formatting difficulties.

	Josh Woodward just released three more songs, though I didn&apos;t notice the email until it was about time to do homework again.
	I&apos;ll have to listen to them later.
	These new songs are <a href="https://www.joshwoodward.com/song/LetsSlashGrandmasTires">Let&apos;s Slash Grandma&apos;s Tires</a>, <a href="https://www.joshwoodward.com/song/VeganZombies">Vegan Zombies</a>, and <a href="https://www.joshwoodward.com/song/BeyondtheSky">Beyond the Sky</a>.
	I&apos;ve actually heard Vegan Zombies before, and it&apos;s kind of funny.
	I don&apos;t like that all the &quot;vegan&quot; zombies relapse and eat human brains though.
	It sounds like it&apos;s saying that vegans are bound to relapse, with few if any exceptions.
	Perhaps I&apos;m reading too much into that though.
</p>
<p>
	The course registration period at University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> started two days ago, but I didn&apos;t notice! I thought that they were going to send an email notification, so I wasn&apos;t watching.
	I should probably register for courses as soon as I have time, but not tonight.
	Tonight, I instead got started on the newly-available homework.
</p>
<p>
	I wondered if any other students had had the same idea as I did on the paper on our choice of the Canadian magazine dispute or the attempt to get an exception for the global ban on whaling, to I checked that out first.
	Our papers were supposed to be at least seven hundred words on <strong>*one*</strong> of the two topics.
	Instead, I wrote over seven hundred words on <strong>*each*</strong> topic, then merged the two essays, treating each of the former essays as a section of the larger essay, then added an introduction and conclusion to tie it all together.
	The result was a paper that was over three times the minimum word count and addressed both topics.
	Had anyone else done that as well? Two of the essays that I&apos;m supposed to grade only discussed one of the topics, which was fine.
	However, the third essay was disappointing; the student had had the inverse idea as I did.
	Instead of using the split topic as an excuse to put more effort in, they used it as an excuse to put <strong>*less*</strong> effort in.
	They wrote about both topics like I had, and their total word count was above the minimum, but their word count on each topic individually was lacking.
	By writing about both topics, they were able look like they&apos;d met the minimum word count without actually putting any effort or details into their assignment.
	I&apos;m not sure how that will effect the grade of the essay yet though, as the assessment form is strangely missing from the webpage.
	I&apos;m certainly going to mark them down if the word count is to be graded though, and I&apos;ll include in my note to them that that kind of attempt to get out of the effort isn&apos;t acceptable.
</p>
<p>
	I also took a look at the grading criteria for the notes on nuclear energy that we took.
	I tried to take good notes, but &quot;good&quot; is subjective.
	I find the facts about how things work more interesting, so that&apos;s what I took notes about.
	I threw in a few names and dates, but honestly, names and dates are useless, so I didn&apos;t include many of them.
	I worried that the grading criteria might ask that the notes be checked for certain criteria and that my notes wouldn&apos;t make the cut.
	I had been worried over nothing though! The rubric simply asks that the grader check to see that notes are present.
	I submitted plenty of notes, so I&apos;m good.
</p>
<p>
	My <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span> reading assignment for the week consisted of six webpages:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pickthebrain.com./blog/5-ways-to-develop-independent-thought/">How to Develop Independent ThoughtPick the Brain | Motivation and Self Improvement</a></li>
<li><a href="http://philosophy.hku.hk./think/critical/">[Module C] Critical thinking</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT_91.htm">Attention Required! | CloudFlare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm">Attention Required! | CloudFlare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_80.htm">Attention Required! | CloudFlare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_91.htm">Attention Required! | CloudFlare</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	The second page turned out to be just an index leading to several other pages though, beefing up the reading assignment.
	I started the reading assignment, but by midnight, I still hadn&apos;t finished it.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
