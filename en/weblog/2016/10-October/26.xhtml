</p>
<ul>
<li>How the <abbr title="GNU &quot;Free&quot; Documentation License">GFDL</abbr> isn&apos;t a free license, and is effectively nonfree even when invariant sections aren&apos;t used</li>
<li>How the telephone number system is screwy</li>
<li>How postpaid mobile plans are bad for customers</li>
<li>How connections using &quot;untrusted&quot; <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificates are more trustworthy than connections without any <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate at all</li>
<li>The importance of free software</li>
<li>The importance of free media</li>
</ul>

	I had a strange dream last night.
	While I could feel pain (as I almost always can in dreams), no one else could.
	However, this weakness came with a strength as well.
	Everyone else was immune to pain, but they otherwise were normal.
	On the other hand, I could manipulate my body to give myself new capabilities.
	I used this to give myself super jumping capabilities to flee a pursuer.
	At one point, some people tried to stop me from jumping from a high place thinking that I was going to hurt myself, but of course, jumping from there only provided me with more bounce so that I could travel further and continue fleeing.
</p>
<p>
	It&apos;s going to take some getting used to this <abbr title="Wide Video Graphics Array">WVGA</abbr> camera mode.
	It works great, but when previewing the photographs on my mobile right after taking them, they appear very blurry.
	I think that the problem is that the mobile has such a high screen resolution and the small images get stretched and blurred.
	I&apos;d much prefer pixilation, as I&apos;d see that the image wasn&apos;t blurry, just small.

	University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> seems to only take online payments via PayPal, so that&apos;s how I payed them for this term.
	They also take Western Union wire transfers, but while PayPal is highly shady, Western Union seems somehow even more shady.
	I could be misjudging them though.
	In any case, PayPal has no business knowing my legal name, so I of course gave them my real name instead.
	PayPal must have communicated the name that I paid under to University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>.
	There shouldn&apos;t be any issues, but with my luck, there could be major problems.
	The best case scenario is that University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>&apos;s system isn&apos;t programmed to notice or care.
	The most likely situation is that they do notice, but assume that I borrowed someone else&apos;s credit card with permission.
	The worst case scenario is that they&apos;ll refund the fee and demand that I pay another way.
</p>
<p>
	I made progress in both of my assignments that I should have completed today, but I didn&apos;t finish either one.
	I still have tomorrow though, as these assignments are due beyond the end of the school week.
	The final exams are now available, though before taking them, I should complete the assignments from last week, read through the reading material of this week, and take the ungraded quizzes offered.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
