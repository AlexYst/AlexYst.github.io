	I reworked my two <span title="Globalization">POLS 1503</span> essays, expanding them to provide more details, then merged the two into a two-part essay, adding an introduction and conclusion to tie the two together.
	I&apos;m only able to actually submit one essay, so merging the two allows me to submit both, but also, the two topics tie together very nicely.
	In both cases, a country is going about trying to preserve culture in the wrong way.
	In Canada&apos;s case, they claimed to be trying to preserve culture, but they were disrupting the international magazine culture that their citizens enjoyed to try to impose a domestic magazine culture that if their citizens had wanted, wouldn&apos;t have needed to have been imposed.
	In Japan and Norway&apos;s case, these countries are trying to preserve their old culture by getting exceptions to a global ban.
	These exceptions would apply to only these two countries, creating a double standard, as citizens outside those countries would still be affected by the ban.
	If this essay were graded by the professor, I think that I&apos;d score well for addressing both issues completely, though because this essay will be peer-graded using a rigid grading rubric that I won&apos;t be able to see until it&apos;s too late, I&apos;m not sure how the unexpected double-essay will will fare against a strict rubric that isn&apos;t designed for that.
	Once that essay was tuned up, I finished my writing to go along with my notes on nuclear energy.
	I was going to write up my replies to other students&apos; discussion posts, but not enough students have posted yet.
	I much prefer to write my replies in a given course in one sitting.
	That way, I can adapt my posts so that I&apos;m not saying the same thing several times and I can take into account all of what I&apos;m replying to, instead of contradicting myself between posts.

	Lately, I&apos;ve been trying to be more effective with my use of time.
	I&apos;ve attempted to rid myself of certain distractions, and I&apos;ve tried to get my homework done as early in the week as is feasible.
	I&apos;ve even kept my <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> client disconnected while I have any homework that needs to be done.
	It&apos;s really paying off.
	Today, I&apos;ve saved enough time to finish the last of my missing journal entries.
	Starting now, I can actually move forward on projects such as <a href="https://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/y.st./include.d">include.d</a> and my efforts to clean up this website.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;ve now added per-file copyright years to this website&apos;s source code that are used in the website&apos;s main template in the copyright messages.
	What this means is that each year, on the first of January, the entire website won&apos;t need to be rebuilt just because the a new copyright year was added.
	Instead, each page has it&apos;s own relevant copyright year or years.
	Mostly, this will help with my journal, which in a few years, will have over a thousand pages.
	As the number of pages builds up, it would have been an even bigger upload each and every January first.
	As I make other improvements to the template though, there will be times in which the entire website will be rebuilt, it&apos;s just no longer the guaranteed and ever-worsening time bomb that it once was.
	For journal pages, the copyright year flag is optional, and if unspecified, will default to the year of the day that the journal entry represents.
	On all other pages, the copyright year flag is mandatory.
	Speaking of ever-worsening time bombs, there are a couple of others that I need to fix as well.
	A secondary yearly time bomb is present in the yearly weblog index pages.
	They have a &quot;current year&quot; link that gets automatically updated on every year index each time that a new year is added.
	Likewise, there&apos;s a similar link to the current month in the weblog month index pages.
	I&apos;ve got some code that fixes that little issue for the latest daily entry links, so I just need to apply the same concept in these two other places by setting up dedicated <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s that always represent the current month and current year, whatever month and year that they might be at a given time.
	I&apos;ll probably work on that tomorrow.

	I went out to the woods to hunt mushrooms with my mother.
	Specifically, we were cutting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Chanterelle">chanterelles</a>.
	We got a couple medium-sized bowls of them by the time that we left.
	At first, I wasn&apos;t finding any, but I did manage to find one small patch of them.
	Hopefully they&apos;ll get eaten before they go bad.
	I don&apos;t particularly like mushrooms myself, but Vanessa and our mother eat them.
	Mushrooms don&apos;t last long though, so if not eaten quickly, they can&apos;t be salvaged.
