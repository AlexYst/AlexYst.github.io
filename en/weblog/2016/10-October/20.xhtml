	I&apos;ve got no essays to write this week, so I&apos;m in much less of a rush.
	Today, I took a much-needed break for schoolwork.
</p>
<p>
	This term has been on and off stressful for me, but in the coming term, I think that I can do better by rearranging my schoolwork priorities.
	I&apos;ve been finishing my initial discussion posts first, as that&apos;s the courteous thing to do.
	After all, that gives other students more time to post responses.
	However, the courses are too fast-paced for me to be courteous, especially once we begin our actual move and I have to put a lot of time into that.
	Instead, I need to focus on my essays first.
	The sooner that the essays are completed, the more days I&apos;ll be able to go over them again.
	Discussion posts are second in urgency though, and should be worked on as soon as the initial drafts of the essays are completed.
	I&apos;m not going to spend much time worrying about my grades though, as long as I seem to be staying above the 90% line.
	There are too many variables, seeing as I never know who will be grading my work, and some people mark me down incorrectly (usually when I&apos;m marked down though, I deserve it).
	Grades would be just one more thing to stress about and I don&apos;t have time for perfection.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;ve been taking daily photographs to add to my journal entries since the <a href="/en/weblog/2016/10-October/09.xhtml">ninth</a>.
	Most of these have just been photographs of neighborhood plants, but there&apos;s a few other things in there too.
	Today, on my way to photograph a red berry tree that I&apos;d seen before, I found a cedar with some cones and decided to photograph that instead.
	On a whim, I decided to look up online what cedar cones look like to be sure that I put the correct <code>alt</code> text on my image, and what I found shocked me.
	The cedars in my area that I know and love <a href="http://oregonstate.edu./trees/conifer_genera/false_cedars.html">aren&apos;t cedars</a>! They&apos;re not in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Cedrus">cedar (cedrus)</a>, and apart from being evergreen trees, look nothing like <a href="http://oregonstate.edu./trees/conifer_genera/true_cedar.html">true cedars</a>.
	These &quot;false cedars&quot; don&apos;t even all share a genera.
	Confusingly, these trees do have &quot;cedar&quot; in their common names despite the fact that they&apos;re not cedars at all.
	I think that the tree that I found today is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/Thuja_plicata">Pacific redcedar</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
