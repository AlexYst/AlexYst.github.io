	I figured out what my <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span> topic will be: my argument with T-Mobile about getting my tablet <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card activated.
	It&apos;s not a great topic, and given more time, I&apos;d be able to come up with something much more consequential, but at least this topic will allow me to get the assignment done by Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
	We went to visit the grave of the cat that was killed on the <a href="/en/weblog/2016/10-October/02.xhtml">second</a>.
	It was a short hike through the forest, then we stayed for a bit, hiking some more, looking for flowers to put on the grave.
	There aren&apos;t many wild flowers out at this time of year though, and we ended up instead mostly putting maple leaves, some sort of white berries, ferns, and moss on the grave.
	We did put some flowers that Vanessa had brought from elsewhere though, along with some thistle flowers that we found on the trail.
</p>
<p>
	A while after we had gotten home, I heard our mother yelling at Vanessa.
	It seems that our mother had become convinced that Vanessa wanted to go out to eat, though Vanessa wasn&apos;t actually interested in this.
	Furthermore, our mother had had several things that they wanted to get done today, but had put them off until the last minute.
	They then proceeded to yell at Vanessa for taking what little time that they had at the end of the day, despite the fact that Vanessa had wanted to stay home anyway.
	To top it off, after deciding that Vanessa must want to go out to dinner, our mother wasted an hour watching a movie on their computer before acting, either towards eating out or getting any of their tasks for the day completed.
	I really don&apos;t understand my mother at all.
	We all ended up going out, but it was very stressful for both Vanessa and our mother.
</p>
<p>
	At the end of the day, Vivian and Cyrus went home.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.

	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
