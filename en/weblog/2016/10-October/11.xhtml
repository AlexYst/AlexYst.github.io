	Since I first started using my GT-i9100M, there have been small problems.
	At first, the problems were too small and I was too busy, so I didn&apos;t complain about them.
	I was far behind in my journal entries, so rather than griping about every little thing when I&apos;d write about my day, I kept to the more important aspects of the day and ignore my mobile.
	I also rwote some of the issues off as simply being because I was on a different device than when I was on my old GT-i9300.
	For example, the battery life on my GT-i9100M has been much worse than on my GT-i9300.
	The GT-i9300 needed to be charged before I went to bed, then topped up a bit after I awoke, but the simple fact is that it could stay powered on through the night without major drawbacks.
	However, the GT-i9100M needs to be turned off before I go to bed.
	Otherwise, the battery either completely drains, or if I&apos;m lucky, only reaches critically-low levels.
	Either way, it&apos;s not good for the battery and would cut down on how many years the battery will last, so I try to avoid allowing that to happen.
	Likewise, the GT-i9300 could stay charged throughout the day, but I&apos;ve had to purchase a portable charging pack for the GT-i9100M because it drains its battery so quickly.
	There have also been interface quirks that I&apos;ve chalked up to worse hardware support.
	It&apos;s been hard to get certain parts of the interface to respond correctly when tapped.
	In fact, I found that the way to make one of the interface components function, specifically the one that allows the setting of a data connection usage warning and data connection usage limit, doesn&apos;t function in the intuitive way at all, so I&apos;d been using it wrong.
	In other words, it wasn&apos;t something huge to get upset over, it was just something that I needed to relearn how to use.
	I&apos;ve also had an issue with the battery level indicator.
	It&apos;s unreliable, often reporting a drastically different battery level after rebooting.
	Sometimes the device will seem to gain power, other times it will lose it.
	It even sometimes slowly seems to gain power when not charging, and I think that it&apos;s seemed to lose power sometimes when it is charging.
	The lock screen can also be a pain, not always accepting my taps.
	However, last night, I ran into my first major issue with the device.
</p>
<p>
	Yesterday when I awoke, I found that my GT-i9100M&apos;s battery was completely dead.
	I figured that I must have forgotten to power the device off before I went to bed.
	Now, I no longer think that.
	Last night, when I tried to power off the device, instead of fully powering off, it instead <strong>*rebooted*</strong>.
	It must have done that the night before too, but I hadn&apos;t noticed right away.
	Today, no matter how many times I instructed the device to power down, it immediately powered back up.
	I could find no way around this short of removing the battery so that it was physically incapable of remaining powered on.
	I even tried reinstalling the operating system and wiping the cache, but to no avail.
	After trying to get the device to function all day, the thing went into a stupid reboot loop.
	Even when I wasn&apos;t trying to shut the bloody thing off, it kept restarting.
	I tried formatting the <code>/data</code> partition and reinstalling Replicant again, but the device still refused to power off.
	That did fix the reboot issue that was happening without any attempt to power the device off though.
	It caused a new issue though.
	When the device was plugged in to charge, it would now shut off, though only sometimes.
</p>
<p>
	It&apos;s been recommended to me that I dismantle the device.
	Supposedly, cleaning the contacts on the &quot;lock switch&quot; would potentially fix the problem.
	I think that this &quot;lock switch&quot; is the power button, but I don&apos;t have the correct screwdriver to open up the device.
	I was going to try to get ahold of one tomorrow, but a strange thing happened before my plans were set in stone.
	I&apos;ve taken to adding daily photographs to my journal over the past couple days, so I planned to do that tomorrow as well.
	I couldn&apos;t very well be taking photographs using CyanogenMod instead of Replicant, so I reinstalled Replicant.
	Now my device actually powers off! What in the world is going on!? I&apos;d already tried reinstalling Replicant three or four times before that and it had never fixed the problem ....
	However, now the device won&apos;t show me the internal storage over <abbr title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</abbr>.
	It will, however, show me the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card&apos;s storage over <abbr title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</abbr> Something is seriously wrong with this device and I have no idea how to even begin debugging it.
