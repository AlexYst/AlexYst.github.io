	Today is beyond the time period in which my old domain registrar could counter my credit card charge dispute.
	I&apos;ve checked my Discover account, and they never countered it, so the dispute can now officially be considered resolved.

	It seems that the point that I quit misusing the <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> <code>&lt;q/&gt;</code> tag was about halfway through May, so having worked my way to that point, I was able to put an end to my <code>&lt;q/&gt;</code> tag hunt.
	I did do a quick once-over of the newer journal entries, but with <code>&lt;q/&gt;</code> tags being much less dense, it didn&apos;t take much time at all.
	I think that my next project will be to scan the website for missing <code>&lt;code/&gt;</code> tags around references to <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> tags, as well as around <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> function/class/constant names that include backslashes or parentheses.
	Aside from those two cases, I&apos;m not sure what I can <code>grep</code> for that is in need of fixing.
	I anticipate much less effort will be needed for this, so I am free to put it off instead of hacking at the problem a little each day.
	Additionally, with these two essays that I need to get done being due soon, I certainly plan to wait before getting started on further website cleanup.
	I really want to have these things done by the end of the year though, and will likely have them done by the end of next school week, assuming that the process is as quick as I think that it is.

	Both my program advisor and student services wrote back to me this morning about my course registration issues, both asking for my student <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> number.
	I don&apos;t think that I need both working on the same problem, and had only written to student services because my program advisor hadn&apos;t written back, so I responded only to my program advisor.
	My program advisor got back to me tonight, telling me to register for <span title="Principles of Business Management">BUS 1101</span>, the course that I&apos;m able to register for but don&apos;t need for my degree, telling me that it&apos;ll count as an elective.
	That is not a good way to handle the situation.
	It appears that I&apos;m enrolled in the school&apos;s associate degree program, which only allows for two elective courses.
	What if I want to choose something that actually interests me as my electives? Even more importantly, what if this keeps happening and I run out of electives to blow in this manner? In the bachelor degree program, I&apos;d have five electives to kill instead of only two, but I should still have some sort of choice in how I spend them.
	My program advisor also didn&apos;t address the issue of not being able to register for a second course in the coming term, nor did they address the fact that the university is still asking for proof of my high school completion when they have already received it.
	Below is a revised list of courses that I need, this time color-coding courses based on if I need them for both the bachelor degree and the associate degree or only the bachelor degree.
	I used it to figure out how many elective I have to spare, but it could come in handy later as well.
	I&apos;m finding this situation to be highly stressful, but there&apos;s not really anything that I can do about it.
	I&apos;ve written back to my program advisor again, this time expressing my concern with burning my elective credits so early on, asking why the website is trying to choose how I spend my elective credits, asking how I register for a second course, and asking again what to do about the fact that the university is still asking for proof of high school completion when they already have it.

	I thought that I&apos;d start the day working on my <span title="Globalization">POLS 1503</span> essay, but I finished up my <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span> essay first instead.
	I think that it probably still needs a little work, and if there&apos;s time tomorrow, I should try to touch it up a bit.
	I wasn&apos;t on top of my schoolwork this week, and as a result, I&apos;m as stressed as I was when I first started dealing with weekly schoolwork.
	I need to get back into the swing of things and complete my schoolwork as soon as possible each week.

	Professor Shyguy released <a href="https://professorshyguy.bandcamp.com/album/one-byte-lie-the-aeronauts">One Byte Lie (The Aeronauts)</a> today.
	I&apos;ll have to give it a listen at some point that I&apos;m not so stressed out.
