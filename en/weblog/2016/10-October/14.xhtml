	Current countdowns:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>3 days until my old domain registrar can no longer counter my charge dispute</li>
	<li>9 months worth of weblog entries to correct misuse of the <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> <code>&lt;q/&gt;</code> tag in</li>
	<li>249 scheme-specific <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-parsing classes to write and add to <a href="https://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/y.st./include.d/releases">include.d</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	I just realized something: now that I know that the University of <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> submission forms have an option to accept <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> input, I can make all the little formatting adjustments that I normally make here to my submissions! This includes things such as marking up acronyms and making emphasized text actually bold in addition to just delimited with asterisks! I can do that in essays, I can do that in discussion assignments, I can do that in learning journal entries ...
	I can even make the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s in the essay references section into actual hyperlinks! I can make the inline citations into hyperlinks pointing to the correct reference as well! It&apos;ll take a little bit more effort, but it&apos;ll also provide me with a better essay to archive.
</p>
<p>
	I was going to start today with my <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span> essay, but the assignment is to talk about a conflict that I recently encountered.
	I can&apos;t think of any conflict in my life that happened recently and that I&apos;d want to write a full essay on.
	There&apos;s an option to chose a conflict that I encountered recently in the news, and if I looked up a news story now, my encounter of it couldn&apos;t be more recent.
	What kind of conflict would I want to write about though? How can I spin this assignment so that I can make the resulting essay at least somewhat useful? It&apos;s going to take more thought, and I can&apos;t waste time while I still have another essay to write, so I&apos;ll think on the matter as I go.
	For now, I completed the <span title="Globalization">POLS 1503</span> readings, took the graded quiz, and began on that course&apos;s essay, one on <abbr title="genetically modified organism">GMO</abbr>s and the flow of goods.
	Unfortunately, the assigned reading material is behind a login wall again, so there would be no point in trying to include a link to it in this entry.
	The <a href="https://fod.infobase.com/p_ViewPlaylist.aspx?AssignmentID=U9SA5J">videos</a> for the week are malfunctioning again, so I wasn&apos;t able to watch them.
</p>
<p>
	I wrote to the company that Vanessa had me order from last month.
	The package still hadn&apos;t arrived.
	As it turned out, they never sent it.
	They tried to verify my email address and telephone number with my credit card provider.
	I&apos;ve never seen any company attempt to verify the email address before, and I don&apos;t even have a telephone number on file with Discover, so there&apos;s nothing to match the <a href="tel:+15555550101">provided telephone number</a> against.
	I wrote back explaining that I could try placing the order again using the email address on file with Discover, but that I don&apos;t have telephone service and don&apos;t have a telephone number on file with my card company, then asked how I could get the order to go through.
	This is strange though.
	I always use a different spam trap email address with each merchant (and with each website in general), and that&apos;s never been an issue before.
	Likewise, I always enter a bogus telephone number when purchases require one, as there&apos;s no valid telephone number to provide them.
	The real kicker here though is that the merchant just canceled my order on me and didn&apos;t even notify me of it.
	We&apos;ve been waiting a few weeks for it to arrive, but it never will.

	My <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> still sings the tune of freedom and transparency.
