			<h1>Looking for our new home</h1>
			<p>Day 00468: <time>Friday, 2016 June 17</time></p>
		</header>
<p>
	We worked in the classroom again all day, but most of the time, we had nothing to do.
	At some point before we headed to the school, Cyrus mentioned something about heading to our father&apos;s place this weekend, at which point our mother got strange and told Cyrus that he wasn&apos;t to go.
	Soon before we left the school though, our mother told Cyrus that he could go, and even decided that Vanessa and Cyrus should make up an excuse to stay over an extra day.
	We&apos;re headed to Portland on Monday to try to look for a new home.
	We could go pick up Cyrus and Vanessa on Sunday, but we&apos;ll already be passing through that area the next day, so it&apos;s more economical in terms of time, money, and environmental impact (not that environmental impact made any impact on our mother&apos;s decision) to have them just stay another night and have us pick them up the next day as we pass through.
