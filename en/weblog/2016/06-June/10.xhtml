			<p>Day 00461: Friday, 2016 June 10</p>

<p>
	I&apos;ve been a bit behind lately in everything, especially website maintenance, so I&apos;ve been utterly and completely ignoring my email inbox on most days.
	It seems that I missed a letter from Marc saying that they&apos;ve put <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/album/bubblegum-romance">Bubblegum Romance</a> back on vinyl.
	If you prefer digital music, this doesn&apos;t seem to have any particular relevance, but if you&apos;ve been yearning to get this album in analogue form, now&apos;s your chance before it sells out again.
</p>
<p>
	Cyrus, Vanessa, our mother, and I headed to the hills to pick up bullet shells for a short time while waiting for Vivian to arrive.
	When they reached our place and we met up with them, Vivian had bad news.
	Their elimination diet hasn&apos;t been helping and they now get daily migraines.
	I&apos;m not sure what needs to be done, but hopefully their doctor will have other things to try.

	<h2>Document modifications</h2>
	<p>
		On <a href="/en/weblog/2018/01-January/16.xhtml#Vivian">2018-01-16</a>, my sister, Vivian, requested that I replace all instances of her legal name in my journal with the name &quot;Vivian&quot;.
		She also asked that the name of the organisation she works for be redacted.
		This page was modified to fulfil that request.
