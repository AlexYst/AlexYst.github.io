	I spent most of the day finishing up my essay on the <abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr>.
	I wanted to also complete my essay on exam proctors, but I ran out of time.

<p>
	<a href="ircs://freenodeok2gncmy.onion:6697/">Freenode</a> has finally <a href="https://freenode.net./news/tor-online">re-opened its door to <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users</a>! Unfortunately, like last time, they don&apos;t allow us in the front door.
	We&apos;re required to use the onion address.
	Furthermore, they demand that <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users first connect to the network without <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> to register an account, and an account is required to get in the back door.
	Normally, I&apos;d be up in arms about this, but there is still a working solution due to how incompetently freenode is run.
	Specifically, freenode has both a blacklist and a whitelist, and the two overlap.
	If you try to connect to freenode over <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> for a few hours, you&apos;ll eventually get in.
	From there, you can set up your account, then use the back door to avoid the hours-long wait next time.
	Please be warned though that after setting up your freenode account, you must configure the account to recognize your client certificate.
	If you forget to do that, you&apos;ll have to go through the hours-long wait again.

	Vanessa and our mother arrived home today.
	As expected, there wasn&apos;t anything that I could have helped my mother&apos;s sibling with, so there would have been no point in my going.
