	My FreedomPop billing cycle restarted today, but I have a strange amount of data to start with.
	I don&apos;t think that my plan was upgraded to the 500 megabyte one mentioned in advertising, but I do think that my remaining unused data from last month carried over to this month.
	This might be a one-time thing though, caused by a gratis trial that had been attached to my account for part of the month.
	Next month, the same thing might not happen again.

	My mother has an interview in Sweet Home on Wednesday.
	Vanessa and our mother ended up not going to check out the apartment in Salem today, as that scheduled interview, as our mother put it, puts us on hold again.
	If they get the job, we&apos;re not going to want to have already moved to Salem.

	I finished up the journal assignments that I was supposed to have done by yesterday.
	I&apos;m not sure why the deadline was today instead of yesterday, but it sure did save me this time.

	I need to start planning out my school week in advance.
	Unfortunately, due to not knowing what the week will involve until it starts, I can&apos;t plan overly far in advance, but I can start my week out right.
	Today begins a new school week, and this week, I thought that I should:

	Strangely, the mock assignment that I was supposed to grade in <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span> last week, which was officially due tonight, is nearly identical to the written assignment that I have to <strong>*write*</strong> in <span title="Globalization">POLS 1503</span> this week! The only difference is that in the <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span>, the imaginary student was supposed ti include a word count (and did not).
	The new assignment for <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span> is an easy one with a topic of little consequence (exam proctoring), so I won&apos;t devote too much time to it.
	I&apos;ll save my time to work on my other schoolwork instead.
	If I come up with ways to improve my <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span> essay as the week continues though, I will take those opportunities.
	My plans to start out with the discussion questions were quickly disrupted, when the first discussion question that I answered directly referenced the discussion guide.
	I ended up needing to read <span title="Online Education Strategies">UNIV 1001</span>&apos;s discussion guide before responding, and upon second thought, I should probably do the same with <span title="Globalization">POLS 1503</span>&apos;s discussion guide and question.

	My reading assignment for today was these pages:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://cs.auckland.ac.nz./courses/compsci747s2c/lectures/paul/Student_peer_assessment_-_Stephen_Bostock.pdf">Microsoft Word - Bostock.doc - Student_peer_assessment_-_Stephen_Bostock.pdf</a></li>

<li><a href="http://jolt.merlot.org./vol5no1/al-shalchi_0309.htm">JOLT - Journal of Online Learning and Teaching</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nwlink.com./~donclark/hrd/bloom.html">Bloom&apos;s Taxonomy of Learning Domains: The Cognitive Domain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	I didn&apos;t finish reading two of those pages, and thus didn&apos;t work on the discussion assignment.
	It&apos;s already day zero and I&apos;m behind because I was catching up from last week!
</p>
<p>
	Tonight, we finished loading up the van, then took the load to the storage unit.
	On the way there and back, my mother and I were talking, and it seems that they want me to go go to Portland with them this weekend, despite the fact that they know that I have homework to work on.
	The chances of there being anything that I can help with are slim.
	Going to Portland will be a very poor use of my time, and though I won&apos;t tell them, it leaves me very frustrated.
