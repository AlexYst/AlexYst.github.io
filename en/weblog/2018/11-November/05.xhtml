	<h2>Eyewear</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t quite remember where the insurance office is, though I had a vague idea of where to find it.
		I looked up a map, which made the trek seem complicated.
		I figured the mapping website was using a different route than I&apos;d used before.
		Still, these were the only directions I had, so I did my best to remember and follow them.
		Getting there was actually a lot less complicated than the map made it seem.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sure enough, I&apos;d had it right all along: the insurance company doesn&apos;t cover any part of vision care, though as I&apos;d separated eye exams and glasses in my question because my workmate said one was covered and not the other, the representative made sure to point out that non-vision-related eye exams.
		For example, if I had an eye infection and got referred to an optometrist, my insurance would cover that.
		The representative did give me the street address and email address of a group that helps cover the cost of getting glasses though, so off I went to my next destination.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once there, I needed to find a particular office suite they supposedly inhabit.
		I never did find that suite, though someone in one of the neighbouring suites informed me that they&apos;d left the building and moved away.
		People don&apos;t always respond to emails, but that&apos;s my only shot, so I wrote to them once I got back home.

	<h2>Closed</h2>
	<p>
		I was already in Eugene, and I thought I&apos;d either stop by that café I enjoy or pay a visit to the recycling centre to see if they carry hard drive enclosures.
		I&apos;ve been considering adding that to the list of things I need to get done before next term starts, anyway.
		I decided to go with the more productive choice: looking for a hard drive enclosure.
		I forgot though - they&apos;re closed on Mondays!
		After dropping by their closed store, there wasn&apos;t time to hit up the café.
		Too bad.
