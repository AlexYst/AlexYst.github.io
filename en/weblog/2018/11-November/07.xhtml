<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed someone was trying to invent a way to hover using magnets.
		Meanwhile, I was using simple cardboard boxes to hover around the room.
		They pretty much acted like flotation devices, and I grabbed onto them tightly to stay afloat with the boxes.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="IRAs">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr>s</h2>
	<p>
		The company holding the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> set up by my employer seems like they&apos;re going to be a pain to get ahold of.
		They&apos;ve got a contact form, which I filled out, but I got the impression from the form that they don&apos;t tend to actually read messages sent to them.
		I don&apos;t know what it was exactly that gave me that impression, but I doubt that I&apos;m wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I needed to loon into my old <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company.
		I wasn&apos;t quite sure who they were though.
		My credit union set me up with an <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> account with a third party, and I&apos;ve gotten mail from two different <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> companies in the past.
		I guess the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> got transferred to another company at some point?
		In any case, I never remember which one&apos;s current.
		I set aside my most recent letter from the one when it came in, so I&apos;d know exactly which one currently holds my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> for when I need to contact them, but during my big organisation spree not too long ago, that letter ended up in the paperwork box along with every other piece of paperwork I need to deal with.
		My only option was to sort the box so I could find the letter.
		And of course, I had no way to know which letter was the correct one, so I needed to sort the entire box, and not just stop when I found a letter that looked right.
		From there, I could compare postmark dates to find the most-recent one.
	</p>
	<p>
		With renewed knowledge of who my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> is even held by, I looked up their website to figure out what to do.
		It didn&apos;t look like there was anything I could do without a user name and password, which my credit union had never given me when they set up the account.
		It was a dead end.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now having the most-recent letter from the investment company in hand, I figured I could get help from Oregon Community Credit Union.
		They&apos;d set up the account, they&apos;d know how to access and update it.
		However, I was wrong.
		Apparently, the credit union is irresponsible with other people&apos;s investments.
		At the time they set up the account, they had an affiliation with that investment company, which was why they talked me into transferring my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> savings there.
		They later cut ties with that company, and rather than alerting me to the fact they were going to do that and giving me a chance to transfer my savings to somewhere I&apos;d still have access to it, they just left me with no way to access the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> account at all.
		If I can&apos;t find a way to access this account without jumping through unreasonable hoops (such as making telephone calls even though I don&apos;t have telephone service), I&apos;ll likely cut ties with this credit union, and transfer my remaining funds to Selco until I have a chance to set up an <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> that can actually be managed in a reasonable manner.
	</p>
	<p>
		So anyway, Oregon Community told me I need to find a way to get in touch with the investment company directly.
		On their website, I found a contact form and wrote up a decently-lengthy description of my problem:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Several years ago, Oregon Community Credit Union set up a ROTH IRA for me using your company.
			However, they now say they&apos;re no longer affiliated with your company, so they can&apos;t help me manage the account.
			I can&apos;t manage the account through your website either, because the credit union never gave me the user name and password associated with the account.
			My best guess is that the credit union used some sort of partner interface or something, and that no user name or password was ever established.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have since had my legal name changed.
			I have the name change paperwork on hand, and need to get the name on the account updated.
			I still continue to receive updates through the mail about the IRA account, though they&apos;re still addressed to my old name.
			How do I get a user name and password set up for my account?
			How do I get my legal name updated in your system?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
			~ Alex Yst
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Having written all that up, as well as having filled in several other form fields, I submitted the form.
		And what do I find?
		The submission was declined due to some undisclosed error!
		I was convinced the website was maliciously discriminating against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users as a form of pseudo-security.
		That sort of thing often happens on the websites of lazy financial institutions that can&apos;t be bothered to implement real security measures.
		However, I tried submitting the form again (without modifying any of the content), and it worked this time.
		I&apos;m still not sure what the undisclosed error was caused by, but it seems getting in touch with the financial institution may be possible without unnecessary garbage.
		Potentially.
		I still haven&apos;t heard back from them (I wrote at a time near the end of or maybe even after business hours, so of course I wouldn&apos;t hear from them today), so I can&apos;t be sure things will work out like they should, but no signs yet have said that they&apos;ll give me trouble.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="paperwork">
	<h2>Sorting paperwork</h2>
	<p>
		While sorting, I stumbled across that voting ballot I mentioned being too busy to fill out and send in.
		Better to not vote than to make random choices because I didn&apos;t have time to study what the candidates were about, right?
		It turns out it was a primary election ballot though.
		That&apos;s why it didn&apos;t affect my general election voting streak that apparently, the government not only tracks but makes public record.
	</p>
	<p>
		Phase 0 of the paperwork sorting is complete.
		Namely, I&apos;ve sorted the paperwork into three main groups:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Things to recycle
		</li>
		<li>
			Things to securely recycle
		</li>
		<li>
			Things to file
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		All previously-unopened mail has been opened and dealt with.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="dental">
	<h2>Dental appointment</h2>
	<p>
		On the way home from the credit union, I took a detour and swung by my dentists&apos; office.
		Since having that last tooth pulled, the neighbouring tooth has been pressed rather hard up against the tooth next to it on the other side.
		I was told that things in my mouth would shift around a bit, so I held off on complaining too much, but it just keeps pressing harder against that other tooth.
		Now, it&apos;s come to the point where it hurts slightly if I push on that tooth with my tongue.
		Something needs to be done about this; the problem isn&apos;t going away on its own as was implied it would.
		It&apos;s not overly urgent, I would think, but I should deal with it while I have time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much to my surprise, there were two available appointments <strong>*tomorrow*</strong>.
		Had I waited even one more day to get an appointment, who knows how long I would need to have waited?
		Now though, I can get it looked at before the coming term starts and I get bogged down by my school&apos;s toxic atmosphere again.
		The problem probably won&apos;t be fixed by then, but perhaps whatever treatment will be administrated will be complete and I&apos;ll just need to wait for it to cause my tooth to shift back into a healthy position.
		(This is probably way off, but I&apos;m picturing that they&apos;ll put some sort of wedge between my teeth and leave it there to slowly force the teeth apart.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Interestingly, the dentist I&apos;ll be seeing tomorrow isn&apos;t the one that usually sees me.
		I mean, I get that my insurance company assigned me to this entire dentists&apos; office and not to a specific dentist, but this office always has me see the same dentist.
		I sort of assumed that the dentists&apos; office had assigned me a specific dentist.
		Not that I mind one way or the other, but it was certainly a surprise to me.
