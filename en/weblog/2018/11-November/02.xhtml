	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		Is I said recently, though in journal entries currently censored by the school as of the writing of this, my two main goals for this break period are trying out home hair-removal recipes that are supposed to be permanent and getting my life into a state of better organisation.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the permanent hair removal, I&apos;ve stumbled upon a few remedies.
		One says to use a paste of turmeric, one says to use a paste of chickpea flower, and one says to use a paste of turmeric and baking soda.
		I&apos;m hoping to find something cheaper and less time-consuming than medical procedures such as electrolysis.
		That said, I don&apos;t have high hopes.
		I think these remedies are likely to fail and I&apos;ll have to go with something more scientifically tested, even if more costly to both my time and my budget.
	</p>
	<p>
		So starting for the remedy attempts, I&apos;m going to be making a paste of all three ingredients and leaving it on my chest for a about half an hour each day (until the paste dries) for twelve days.
		Today is day zero of the treatment.
		If there&apos;s no improvement, I&apos;ll probably see reason and add actual electrolysis or laser treatment to my plans.
		Using it on my chest instead of my arms or legs will leave me mostly able to continue being productive at home, but on the off chance it works out, I can add it to my arms and legs as well.
		I&apos;m not expecting full results in that time, but I should at least see <strong>*some*</strong> change, right?
		If I have the energy, I may keep it up longer even if I haven&apos;t seen a change yet, but when this twelve-day period ends, school will be back in session, so it&apos;s likely I&apos;ll be pretty drained from school.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, day zero, it appears to have irritated my skin a bit, but no visible hair removal has occurred.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found a another recipe that takes longer, but is a thousand times more convenient.
		You leave it on your skin for about ten seconds at a time, so you don&apos;t have to worry about getting it on things as you go about other tasks.
		You use it twice a day for about six months, but with the shorter time intervals, I could deal with it while school is in session.
		The only catch is that I need gram flour.
		I couldn&apos;t find that in any of the stores I checked.
		I might check in a local health food store later and see if it&apos;s one of those obscure health food ingredients.
	</p>

<section id="organisation">
	<h2>Organisation</h2>
	<p>
		I finally got my toothpaste prescription refilled like I&apos;ve been meaning to for a while.
		Other than that, I spent most of my time organising things around my home.
		My bedroom in particular looks much better.
		My home is still not yet at the point in which I can maintain it even in times of high stress though, so more work will be required.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow&apos;s Saturday, so the businesses I need to contact about various things won&apos;t be open.
		Come Monday, I should probably get on contacting them.
		I&apos;ve been needing to vote in the current election as well, but haven&apos;t had time.
		I can do that on any day of the week, so maybe I&apos;ll do that tomorrow.
		I received a notice in my mailbox today about my voting record.
		Apparently, I&apos;ve voted in all three of the most recent general elections in the state.
		I was sure I&apos;d missed one not too long ago, being too busy to deal with it, but I guess not.
		Also, apparently, whether or not you vote in each election is on public record, though what your vote actually was is kept secret.
		Interesting.
		It is a little creepy though.
		People running campaigns can look up who has voted recently to see who is more likely to vote in the future, which is who they should target with their campaigns if they want to have the greatest chance of success.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="sales">
	<h2>Sales contest</h2>
	<p>
		It looks like I won the sales contest at work after all.
		I mean, during the last couple days of it, I thought I&apos;d win, but in the beginning, I was sure I&apos;d lose.
	</p>
	<p>
		I actually thought for some reason my winning would go unmentioned.
		I don&apos;t know why I thought that.
		The head manager is definitely unreliable, but they&apos;re not the type to hold a contest then try to weasel out of paying the promised prize money.
		As far as I&apos;ve seen.
		I guess it&apos;s just my paranoia at it again.
		Anyway, I planned to wait about a month before bringing it up and asking who&apos;d won.
		I didn&apos;t want to look too anxious and greedy, especially as I&apos;m not concerned about the money anyway.
		No need now though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I might put this toward an eye exam though.
		I&apos;ve needed glasses for a long time, but not been able to afford them, mostly due to debt.
		I&apos;ve been out of debt for a while though, and I&apos;ve got a slowly-growing savings.
		Now&apos;s a good time, too.
		I hope to get a new job soon.
		I&apos;ll be in a new crowd of people.
		Now&apos;s the time to change my image; glasses are certainly going to change the way my face looks.
		I need to talk to the insurance company first though.
		I don&apos;t think they cover anything vision-related, but a workmate claims they cover the physical glasses, but not the exams.
		If my workmate&apos;s right, I should find out and save what money I can.
