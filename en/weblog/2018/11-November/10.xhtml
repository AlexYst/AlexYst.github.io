<section id="shower">
	<h2>Shower curtain rod</h2>
	<p>
		My shower curtain rod fell down today.
		Due to a snapped plastic component on the inside, it no longer contracts like it should, so it&apos;s too long to put back in place.
		It extends really easily, and it even comes entirely apart, but it won&apos;t contract small enough to fit where it needs to.
		I guess I&apos;ll need to replace that when I get a chance.
		Again, this isn&apos;t as important as the other things on my to-do list, but it is much more urgent.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="religion">
	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		The missionaries were supposedly going to send me a reminder email about our appointment at some point.
		To me, that meant at least the day before, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured maybe they meant as late as the day of the meeting.
		No reminder email was sent though, so I still don&apos;t have their email address, and have no way to reach them.
		They&apos;d forgotten to send it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I waited until noon for them to arrive.
		I had things to do today, and couldn&apos;t wait around all day until work.
		They never showed though.
		It wasn&apos;t I that needed the reminder about our appointment, it was them.
		Again, I have no way to reach them though, so I can&apos;t give that reminder.
		I wasn&apos;t sure exactly what time they were planning to drop by, but we&apos;d discussed that I was available mornings, and when they asked for what time worked best, I said any time before noon.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="include.d">
	<h2><code>include.d</code></h2>
	<p>
		While waiting for the missionaries, I reworked my <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> cleanliness checker idea.
		I think a finite state machine would be too slow and clunky.
		I&apos;d originally thought it to be necessary because characters can be allowed in one context but not in another, but I think a better way of dealing with this situation is to iteratively remove each context from the data as it gets checked.
		For example, all characters are allowed within comments.
		The only thing disallowed in comments are the three-character string that ends comments.
		So comments need to be striped before the first check.
		Aside from in comments, apostrophes and <code>&lt;[CDATA[ ]]&gt;</code> sections are not allowed anywhere, so those can be checked for at this stage.
		Next, quotation marks are only allowed in the context of attribute-quoting.
		All tags can be stripped, and quotation marks checked for.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="repair">
	<h2>Bicycle repair</h2>
	<p>
		After the missionaries failed to show up by noon, I headed to the bike shop to see what they could do.
		They seemed unphased by the bike&apos;s limping wheel.
		I have no doubt they can do something about that back brake line; they probably just need to replace it.
		If I bought a brake line, I bet even I could replace it myself; it doesn&apos;t seem too difficult.
		The front brake might just need new brake pads.
		I don&apos;t know, but it seems plausible.
		That back wheel&apos;s limp though ... I can&apos;t fix that myself.
		I don&apos;t have the knowledge or skills required.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, they said they can&apos;t have someone look at it until Monday, but to leave the bike in their care until then.
		So I did.
		They say they&apos;ll email me with an estimate once they&apos;ve had a chance to look the thing over.
