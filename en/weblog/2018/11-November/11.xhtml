	<h2>Bicycle repair</h2>
	<p>
		Apparently, the bike shop sent that estimate about nine minutes after I left for work.
		Then, I stayed after work about an hour talking to a workmate, so I didn&apos;t even start heading home until midnight.
		Because of that, I didn&apos;t get the estimate until early this morning.
	</p>
	<p>
		They tell me it&apos;d cost $300 to $340 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> to repair the thing, and sent me a breakdown.
		It looks real shady though.
		For example, they want to replace both my tires.
		Like, what?
		My tires are very new and don&apos;t need replacing.
		They want to replace the pedals, too.
		I mean, they&apos;re scraped up a bit, but they still perform perfectly.
		It&apos;s just cosmetic damage.
	</p>
	<p>
		My workmate was convinced this&apos;d cost somewhere from fifteen to twenty-five dollars.
		So much for that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, they recommend purchasing a new bike ahead of performing the repairs.
		I&apos;ve written to them asking how much that would cost.
		I&apos;m not going to be able to afford it though.
		Buying a brand new bike is out of the question.
		I walked down to a second-hand store to see if they had a working bike, and maybe a shower curtain rod.
		They usually do have a bunch of bikes, but it&apos;s a long way by foot.
		Round trip, it took me about two and a half hours.
	</p>
	<p>
		They did indeed have many bikes as usual, several of which looked to be in working condition, though they deflate the tires, so I couldn&apos;t try them out and couldn&apos;t ride the one I bought home.
		I chose the one with the lowest price tag of the ones with the biggest wheels, a $40 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> bike.
		I think the smaller wheels on the purple glitter bike were slowing me down; not enough for me to really mind, but enough for every single cyclist to pass me with ease.
		With greater speed, I could get my longer errands completed faster.
		This new bike is a snazzy pink, with what I believe to be &quot;normal&quot;-sized wheels.
		My guess is that this bike was marked down so much because of the colour.
		I mean, many men wouldn&apos;t dare ride a girly bike, as they need to prove their manhood or whatever.
		Meanwhile, there are no really manly bikes.
		Non-feminine bikes are simply gender-neutral, so anyone might choose them.
		That makes the feminine bikes harder to sell, as there are less potential buyers.
	</p>
	<p>
		They had a curtain rod too.
		Several, actually, but most of them were ridiculously short, even when fully extended.
		Maybe they were designed for showers that don&apos;t have a bathtub attached?
	</p>
	<p>
		To be honest, I&apos;m never sure what to expect when I buy cheap, used bikes.
		Which, by the way, are the only bikes I buy.
		The thing was sold to me &quot;as is&quot;, so if it didn&apos;t function, I was out my money and out of luck.
		The tires inflated just fine, so I don&apos;t need to replace the inner tubes as I thought I might.
		The wheels roll without wobble, and the brakes work great.
		I&apos;ll keep the purple glitter bike around for now, as I&apos;m too attached to get rid of it for the time being, but this pink bike&apos;ll get me where I need to go.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m probably not going to update this entry after work though.
		As of writing this, I haven&apos;t actually ridden the bike.
		I&apos;ll learn how well it handles and such on my commute to work, but signs right now are good.

<section id="sting">
	<h2>Sting</h2>
	<p>
		On the way home, I felt a strange pain in my hand.
		It was sharp, but there was a hint of something else there as well.
		I checked out my hand, and found an insect stinger lodged in my glove!
		From the looks of it, something had tried to sting me, but had failed and gotten only my glove.
		I didn&apos;t even notice.
		Later, as I moved my hand around, I&apos;d worked the stinger into a position where it could actually prick me and insert its venom.
		It didn&apos;t hurt much, but I assumed as the venom spread, it&apos;d hurt more.
		It&apos;s a good thing I&apos;m not allergic to bees, wasps, or hornets, as far as I know.
		The pain subsided rather quickly though.
		I figured it&apos;d not poked me deep enough to actually be so much as a nuisance, but thinking back now, it&apos;s likely most of the venom was in the glove.
		The thing stung the glove, injected its venom, and lost the stinger in the glove.
		I was later pricked by the empty stinger, which still had a little venom residue on its tip.
		Not enough to really do much.
