	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I had trouble getting to sleep last night.
		I was just too worried about the final exam today that I was sure I was bound to fail.
		I ended up having to push back my alarm time before I actually did get to sleep so I&apos;d be able to get enough rest for the test.
		That didn&apos;t help though, as I kept waking up in the middle of the night.
		Pushing back my wake-up time also made sure I had no time for breakfast before the test.
		That was bound to make things worse.
		I had a nutrient shake and a protein bar, so I didn&apos;t exactly go on an empty stomach, but I did go into the test room still hungry.
	</p>
	<p>
		The testing centre insists that you pay through their website if you&apos;re going to pay by card.
		I don&apos;t recall this from last time, but it seems you are required to enter your telephone number to pay through the website.
		I&apos;ve been paying from their tablet in the lobby for convenience, but it seems I&apos;ll need to do that every time from now on, so I can talk to them in-person about the stupid telephone number requirement.
		This time, they had me use the testing centre&apos;s number.
		I expect in future cases, they&apos;ll either do the same or have me enter a bogus number.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tablet kept failing on me.
		It doesn&apos;t normally do that, but I guess it&apos;s to be expected.
		It&apos;s a piece of Apple trash.
		Even if it works somewhat at first, I hear they push forced updates that break things after you&apos;ve had your Apple device a couple years so as to encourage you to replace it.
		You think it broke because it&apos;s old, but it actually broke because Apple deliberately broke it to get you to spend more money with them.
	</p>
	<p>
		The test ... went well.
		I think I missed a couple questions due to my own failure to quite remember how to do things we did in fact cover.
		I also missed one question because it&apos;s was on that thing I mentioned before that I&apos;m certain we never covered at all.
		However, while I expected a huge chunk of the test to be on this, it really wasn&apos;t.
		There was only the one question.
		I&apos;m unsure how badly those last two tests hurt my grade though.
		There&apos;s still a chance I&apos;ll have to re-take the course, but I think I&apos;m in the clear.
		I think I&apos;ve done well enough to pass the course and continue on to apply to get my associate degree in the coming term.
		I&apos;m so relieved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before taking the final exam for my other course, I worked on several tasks relating to getting this website ready to update tonight, and nearly forgot to take the exam.
		Of course, I only worked on the website first because of its higher urgency, even with its lower importance.
		I&apos;ve got a couple more days to take the second exam, unlike the first which absolutely had to be completed this morning.
		When I did get back to the second exam, I found the following question:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Coronary heart disease refers to a disease of the liver. True or False?
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		... Seriously?
		I mean, let&apos;s say we hadn&apos;t studied what coronary heart disease is and had never before heard of it.
		The <strong>*name*</strong> of the disease is a pretty good indicator that it&apos;s not a liver-based disease!
		Come on, at least make the questions such that someone not having taken the course would actually have to guess at the answers.

	<h2><code>include.d</code></h2>
	<p>
		At the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting today, I finished the updating of the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>-processing code I mentioned as my final obstacle last week.
		The debug scripts no longer complain about <code>include.d</code>!
		I&apos;ve also set up some useful code for determining the next version number for a new release, based on changes made to the code.
		My version numbers appear to have no rhyme or reason - I admit that - but they&apos;re actually incremented based on the significance within the namespace hierarchy of the new items added in the release.
		Changes made in minor components, denoted by sub-sub-sub-et-cetera-namespaces don&apos;t increment the major version components.
		Changes made in major components in the main namespace do.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next week, the plan is to work on the finite state machine that&apos;ll check my pages for cleanliness errors that don&apos;t cause outright document invalidity.
		If you remember, that was the goal all along, but I ended up working on this code-cleaning project first to make sure all code in <code>include.d</code> going forward would be at least minimally tested.
		Now that the debug code is clean, I can maintain this minimal testing standard for future code (hopefully writing more than the minimal test cases in the process).
