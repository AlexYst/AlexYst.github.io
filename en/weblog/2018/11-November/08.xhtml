	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		The one <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company contacted me back, but they insisted I call them via telephone.
		Ugh.
		My response:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello Kris Clark,
		</p>
		<p>
			I don&apos;t have access to a telephone, so I&apos;m not able to call that number.
			I&apos;m more than happy to scan my documents and send them via email, copy them and send them via post, or anything else that will work, but telephones aren&apos;t an option.
		</p>
		<p>
			What do you want me to do?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>

	<p>
		Their letter just made me so angry.
		Everyone demands that everything be done via telephone, and there&apos;s no good reason for it.
		They&apos;re creating an artificial demand for the horribly-set-up telephone system.
		My guess was that this is going nowhere for the time being.
		They weren&apos;t likely to see reason.
		After all, almost no company demanding a telephone call sees reason upon hearing that that&apos;s not an option.
		The plan was to wait for their response, then go back to Oregon Community Credit Union and try to get help there again.
		That&apos;d fail.
		I just realised today that I can&apos;t actually close my account at that credit union either, as I need that account for my monthly rent cheques as well as my tuition cheques, but I&apos;ll withdraw all but the minimum balance amount (five dollars) and transfer it to Selco.
		They&apos;re not really going to gain much by having me as a member if I only keep five dollars in the account.
		I&apos;d then need to sit on my hands a while while I deal with school and save up for a lawyer.
		And finally, I&apos;ll need to take legal action to get access to my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> account.
		That&apos;s assuming I didn&apos;t cool down by then though.
		I mean, realistically, the legal fees would probably be higher than the value of the account.
		Still, someone needs to teach companies that they can&apos;t demand everything be done via telephone when not everyone has telephone service.
		I shouldn&apos;t need telephone service to access an account that I didn&apos;t need telephone service to set up.
	</p>
	<p>
		I received another response telling me that their company refuses to release account information via email, so they can&apos;t help me via email, but that I can mail my documents to them along with a letter of instruction and what postal address I want them to reply to.
		That I can do.
		They didn&apos;t tell me what documents I need though, nor if a regular copy of my name change court order will work, or if I need to go get a certified copy.
		I decided to go get another certified copy just to be safe, and send it along with a copy of my state-issued <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, both of which I&apos;d need to wait until after my dental appointment to pick up.
		I&apos;m not sure where to get a copy of my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> locally, but I know there&apos;s a place near the courthouse in Eugene, and the courthouse is the only place to get a certified copy of my name change order.
		I chose the certified copy, even though it&apos;s more expensive, because less reason I give them to reject my documents, the more likely it is that I can make this transition smooth.
		I&apos;ll fight you tooth and nail if you try to put artificial dependence on the telephone system that I can&apos;t stand, but if you want to be reasonable and allow multiple methods of communication, I&apos;ll do my best to make sure you don&apos;t regret it.

<section id="religion">
	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		Those missionaries from before returned.
		Apparently, the personal switch-up didn&apos;t affect which missionaries are assigned to my area, and they simply forgot their appointment.
		This time, they have my email address, and they&apos;re supposedly going to send me a reminder of our next appointment, which is this coming Saturday, at which point I&apos;ll have theirs.
	</p>
	<p>
		We discussed the holes in the logic of their pamphlet, but they didn&apos;t really have anything to plug those holes.
		They pretty much just insisted that holes or no holes, they believe their reasoning to be sound.
		They&apos;ve also left me with a book to read; not the main Christian bible, but the Book of Mormon, which is specific to their branch of Christianity.
		They want me to read a couple pages, then pray about them at some point before we next meet.
		I&apos;ll very likely read a little more than that, just because I&apos;m trying to learn what various people believe, even if I don&apos;t believe it myself.
		Otherwise, I would have turned them away the first time or something.
		I think it&apos;s important to understand the beliefs of others; otherwise, you can&apos;t empathise with them.
		As for the praying, as odd as it sounds, I guess I will pray - it the name of science.
		Will the praying do anything?
		No.
		But to just assume nothing will happen without actually trying it would be very unscientific.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="dental">
	<h2>Dental exam</h2>
	<p>
		It turns out my shifting teeth aren&apos;t the problem.
		I had a build-up of plaque and calculus on that tooth.
		They cleaned the area, and also scheduled me an appointment for a full cleaning on 2018-12-04 at 07:00.
		This time, I&apos;m going to be seeing the dentist they usually schedule me to see again.
		They also said I need to start flossing regularly.
		I guess I&apos;ll try to start doing that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Apparently, whatever receptionist or dental assistant (I forget which) told me their office no longer sends things by mail as they&apos;d promised to do before was wrong.
		I don&apos;t know why they thought sending things by post was no longer an option.
		One of the dental assistants today even said they&apos;d received their dental appointment prompt via mail recently.
		However, the address on file for me was missing the apartment number for whatever reason.
		Likely, they tried to send the appointment prompt lie they&apos;d promised, but left off the apartment number because it had for whatever reason not been entered into their system.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="sorting">
	<h2>More file-sorting</h2>
	<p>
		At the last minute, I decided to include a copy of my Social Security card along with my other documents that I was sending to the investment company.
		When I got home from the dental appointment though, I found I couldn&apos;t find my Social Security card!
		I panicked, and quickly looked through both my sorted files and my new to-sort box, but nothing turned up.
		I found a Social Security card with my birth name on it, but that wouldn&apos;t help.
		I was completely at a loss as to where it could be, so I did the only thing I could think to do: go through every file one by one, and sort them all.
		That way, I&apos;d be absolutely sure my Social Security card wasn&apos;t amongst them.
		In my newly-organised bedroom, there&apos;s nowhere else it could hide.
		And barring the possibility of having accidentally thrown it out, I couldn&apos;t figure out where outside the bedroom I could have put it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was in a hurry to rule my files out as where the card was, so I didn&apos;t set up new folders for most of the categories I should have, instead sorting things mostly into existing folders.
		I&apos;ll need to go back and more-thoroughly sort later.
		In any case, the Social Security card wasn&apos;t there.
		I was fairly certain I remembered it not being in my files when I saw it last, so I would&apos;ve been surprised to find it there, but I had to know for sure.
		I&apos;m at a loss as to where the card could be though.
		Where could I have put it?
		When I got the email from the investment company saying they were willing to be reasonable about communication, I honestly thought I&apos;d be able to make today a very productive day.
		That didn&apos;t work out so well though; I&apos;m stuck.
	</p>
	<p>
		My mind keeps wandering to the possibility that I threw the card out; that I simply put it in the wrong pile or something.
		I distinctly remember <strong>*not*</strong> seeing the card though.
		I saw an envelope that I thought at first was the one I keep my Social Security card in, but it turned out to be the wrong envelope.
		Additionally, the box of files was composed of files from very distinct piles in my home.
		I didn&apos;t put my Social Security card in any of these piles specifically because I didn&apos;t want to lose it.
		I always know there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;ll need it again for something soon.
		I know I took it to Selco to set up an account, and I know I left my state-issued <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> there.
		I&apos;m pretty sure I brought my Social Security card back home with me though, and I think I saw it some time a while after the account was opened.
		I think I saw it&apos;d fallen under a table, so I moved it <em>somewhere</em> so as not to lose track of it.
		I just can&apos;t remember where that is though.
		I need that card more than just to deal with this account too.
		I&apos;ll need it if I manage to find a new job soon.
		I think I&apos;ll try getting the Social Security Administration to send me a replacement tomorrow, just in case.
		This really sets back my plans though.
		I tried ordering the card online, but the Social Security website has started blocking me now.
		I tried resetting <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> until if gave me an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address in the United States (Seattle), but even that didn&apos;t work.
		They&apos;re not blocking based on country; I thought they were probably using the all-knowing <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> blacklist.
		This is particularly frustrating, because the Social Security Administration&apos;s website didn&apos;t used to block <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>.
		I have a Web account there and everything.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, I got through.
		Oddly enough, I got through using an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address in Paris, France, even though a <abbr title="United States of America">US</abbr>-based <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address was blocked, as were several other French <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses.
		However, the Social Security Administration only allows people with <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> from certain states order a card online, for whatever reason.
		Oregon, my state, isn&apos;t one of those states.
		My only choices are to go in person to request the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> or to send my request via post.
		Doing it via post will obviously take longer though.
		It&apos;d mean waiting for the the post twice; once to get the request to the Social Security Administration, and a second time to wait for the card to arrive on my end.
		Going in person, I&apos;ve only got to wait for the card to be sent via post.
		I&apos;ll have to do it in person, which means I can&apos;t do it tonight.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried biking down to Selco to see if they had my Social Security card.
		They didn&apos;t.
		I didn&apos;t think they would.
		Still, it was worth a shot.
		It&apos;d be faster to check there than wait for a new one in the mail.
		I wrote to the investment company asking what forms of identity poofs I need, and informed them of the delay should I need my Social Security card after all:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you very much!
			I&apos;ll write in with instructions for my account.
			What documents do I need to send in to prove my identity and change of legal name?
			I was going to send the change of name court order, a copy of my photo ID, and a copy of my Social Security card, but my Social Security card appears to be missing.
			If I need to send a copy of that, it might be a month or more before I can send it, as I may need to order a new copy of the card from the Social Security Administration.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
