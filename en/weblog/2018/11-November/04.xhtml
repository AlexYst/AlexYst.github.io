	<h2>Organisation</h2>
	<p>
		I got my bedroom into a much more maintainable state.
		It took a lot longer than I thought it would, but I&apos;ve pretty much rearranged everything, as well as cleared some things out entirely.
		I don&apos;t exactly have a bed frame; just a mattress and a pad to put under it.
		I&apos;d had tables of various sizes and styles around the walls, with the mattress up against them in one corner.
		I couldn&apos;t really reach things on the tables without getting into bed!
		Furthermore, the mattress tends to work its way slowly off the pad.
		I had drawers on one side next to the mattress, and the shifting mattress was always making it difficult to open them, as it&apos;s move right into their trajectory.
		They were also blocking access to part of the closet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, the mattress and pad are in the very corner of the room, directly up against the wall.
		Strategically-placed tables on the remaining two sides of the mattress prevent the mattress from moving much, but there&apos;s a gap on one side where I can easily get into bed.
		The tables can be accessed from their other sides while out of bed.
		This also lets me store things under the tables easily, which had previously been a difficult task, seeing as the wall was in the way on one side and the mattress was in the way on the other.
		The drawers are over on the other side of the room, where they aren&apos;t interfered with by the mattress and don&apos;t block the closet.
		Lastly, I&apos;ve got a large box for dumping paperwork I have no time to deal with at the moment into.
		It&apos;s currently half full of paperwork that&apos;d previously been scattered about on tables and shelves due to not having time to deal with it before.
		Later before school is back in session, I&apos;d like to get that paperwork sorted, dealt with, and filed away so I can start the new term fresh.
	</p>

		I purchased my replacement rings, but I didn&apos;t have time to put in the thought needed to decide for sure which mobile device to get.
		If I make the wrong choice on the rings, I can always get more rings and have a variety.
		Besides, I tend to order rings, then just take for granted my decision of what rings to get and just enjoy what I&apos;ve got.
		I&apos;m not going to do that with a big-ticket item such as a mobile device though.
		I think the Pira would be the better and more useful device due to it&apos;s full keyboard and <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> ports.
		However, the decision will have a lasting impact on the state of my journal entries.
		If I go with the Librem 5 instead, I&apos;ll have a better camera for taking my journal entry photos.

	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		I think I forgot to mention it, but those missionaries that never showed up for our appointment were from the same church that tracked me down under a name they should have never had.
		Today, another of their number stopped by looking for me under the name it would actually make sense for them to have.
		I played dumb and pretended not to know who that was.
		At the time, I figured that&apos;d get me removed from their list, but now that I think about it, they&apos;d had me on their list under that other name, so I&apos;m probably still on there somewhere.
		Darn.
		Anyway, I mentioned the missionaries from their church that never showed up, and apparently there&apos;s been some sort of personnel switch-up.
		(&quot;Personnel&quot; isn&apos;t quite the right word because missionaries are volunteers and not employees, but I use the word anyway out of lack of a better one.)
		So maybe they didn&apos;t pass along their previous appointments to the next missionaries covering the area like they should have.
		Anyway, this new church representative, who was not only not dressed like a missionary but also not part of a pair, said they&apos;d send some missionaries over on a later date.
		If it&apos;s before school is back in session, it should make for an interesting conversation.
		I&apos;ll need to re-read the material the first pair gave me though to make sure I remember all the holes I need to punch in this church&apos;s logic.
