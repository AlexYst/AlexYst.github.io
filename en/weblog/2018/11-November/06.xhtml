<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was inside a closet, with a bunch of those icky pantry moth larva walking all over the inside of the door.
		I was trying to catch them all in an old cracker back to get rid of them without touching them.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="infestation">
	<h2>Infestation</h2>
	<p>
		Later in the day, I found two actual moth larva in my home.
		I was sure my mother had brought me another infestation!
		There had to be a nest of these little buggers somewhere amongst the boxes she put in my living room.
		I couldn&apos;t find it at first though, or any mass outbreak that would give me some idea of where to look.
		I&apos;ve checked over what little I have by way of dry goods, and put them into the freezer to keep them safe.
		It looks like I caught the problem quickly enough to save all my food.
		I hate these things though, and I wanted them out of my home.
		My plan was to keep a vigilant eye out for them in the coming days, but I just couldn&apos;t help but try harder to find them.
		What&apos;s really strange though is that I had a dream about them, then find a couple.
		I&apos;d love to know what signs I subconsciously picked up on that get these things into my dream before actually seeing them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, I found the problem.
		A while back, I found a glass mug full of nuts on the laundry room table, where people put things they don&apos;t want so other people can take them.
		I wanted the mug, but had no real interest in the nuts.
		My mother gave me a colourful, woven basket, and I wasn&apos;t sure what to do with that.
		So I dumped the nuts, shell and all, into this basket and kept them decoratively.
		At least one of those nuts had been hollowed out by the moths by the time I found the nest, and the bottom of the basket was covered with their little webs.
		I don&apos;t thing the nest was there when I took the nuts.
		I mean, it feels like that was at least a year ago, and that&apos;s a long time for the nest to lie dormant and unhatched.
		My guess is that the nest was made more recently.
		It&apos;s still possible that my mother brought over a moth or two which started the nest, but more likely, I think a pregnant moth flew in my window at some point.
		I did find a pantry moth in here a while back, and I thought I&apos;d killed it quickly enough, but perhaps not.
		I was pretty sure it hadn&apos;t come her home.
		Oddly enough, the local pantry moths seem to have a different wing pattern than my mother&apos;s pantry moths always did.
		When I find a pantry moth here, I can be reasonably certain as to weather or not she had brought it.
		I can&apos;t tell from the larva though.
		To be honest, I hadn&apos;t found any larva I couldn&apos;t tie back to my mother until today, as I keep my place moth-free as best I can.
		These larva looked just like her larva though.
		They probably just don&apos;t have any distinctive features until they&apos;ve matured.

<section id="lock">
	<h2>Bike lock issue</h2>
	<p>
		I stopped by the bike shop as planned to ask about the corroding lock.
		I expected them to try to sell me special lubricant, which I&apos;d happily buy to keep my lock from jamming up entirely like the last two did.
		Instead, they told me to bring the lock in and they&apos;d lubricate it for me, free of charge.
		Wow!
		That was nice of them.
		I then asked if the sell that lubricant.
		It&apos;d be nice to have on hand for next time.
		However, they don&apos;t sell it as one of their offered products because it&apos;s &quot;too expensive&quot;.
		They said if the lock started sticking again to bring it by again and they&apos;d lubricate it once more.
		Not only did they not try to charge me for the maintenance, they&apos;re not trying to sell me anything.
		With everybody else trying to up-sell, up-sell, up-sell, it was a refreshing change.
		It really encourages me to shop at this store in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		I actually already shop there though though when I need the things they carry.
		They&apos;re they only place I know where to go to get bike locks and inner tubes that aren&apos;t Bell brand.
		In fact, they don&apos;t even carry Bell-brand merchandise.
		I prefer not to support the Bell company, due to their low-quality products.
		Everything I&apos;ve ever gotten from Bell was a piece of garbage.
