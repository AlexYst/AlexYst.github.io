			<h1>Updated degree plan</h1>
			<p>Day 01337: Saturday, 2018 November 03</p>
		</header>
<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_4.0/y.st./weblog/2018/11/03.jpg" alt="The official ballot drop box, right where it always sits" class="framed-centred-image" width="640" height="480"/>
<section id="organisation">
	<h2>Getting organised</h2>
	<p>
		I dropped off my ballot as planned.
		I also checked the local health food store for gram flour, but they don&apos;t seem to have it either.
		Who carries gram flour?
		Apparently, it&apos;s a rare item or something.
	</p>
	<p>
		I need to get a schedule worked out for when I plan to get all the tasks I want done completed.
		I started working that out in my head a bit, but then realised I have more important planning to do.
		I needed to read the new course catalogue, find out if the courses I&apos;ve been taking these past two years still cover what I need for the associate degree, then re-plan my bachelor degree, seeing as signs say my old plan may be bogus at this point due to changes in the school.
		Once that was complete, I got back to work on scheduling that which I need to get done outside the school.
	</p>
	<h3>Tomorrow (Sunday, 2018-11-04)</h3>
	<p>
		Everything&apos;s closed.
		Or at least, the businesses I need to speak with likely are.
		I&apos;ll use that day to work on organisation some more.
		In particular, I&apos;d like to finish with my bedroom at the very least.
		I also need to get a few things ordered, such as replacement rings and a replacement mobile.
		It&apos;s been about a year since my mobile device died, and it&apos;s about time I finalise what mobile device I want to get.
		I&apos;ve been eyeing two of them: the Pira and the Librem 5.
		In most ways, I prefer the Pira, but the Librem 5 has something I could really use: a camera.
		It&apos;d be nice not needing to carry the digital camera I have now, which takes up space and takes blurry photos.
		I&apos;ll probably need to go with the Librem 5 due to my daily photography habits.
	</p>
	<h3>Monday (2018-11-05)</h3>
	<p>
		I need to go speak with the insurance company in Eugene about eyewear.
		Do they cover it?
		Probably not.
		After that, I need to go to the eyeglass place near my workplace.
		If insurance won&apos;t cover any of this, I&apos;ll need to cover it entirely myself.
		If they take walk-ins, I need to get an eye exam, otherwise, I need to make an appointment.
	</p>
	<p>
		I do have work this day, and I&apos;m not sure how long all of this will take, so I might not get anything else done.
	</p>
	<h3>Tuesday (2018-11-06)</h3>
	<p>
		Tuesday is errand day, so I might not get much else done.
		<strong>*Maybe*</strong> I&apos;ll have time to talk with the bike shop that sold me my bike lock.
		The rainy weather lately is causing it to corrode like my last two.
		They might have tips as to how to fix it and prevent further damage.
		I&apos;m guessing some sort of oil or something is the key, but the people at the bike shop would have a better idea of what to do than I do.
	</p>
	<h3>Wednesday (2018-11-07)</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;ll have the day off from work.
		Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to get both my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> accounts in order.
		One account&apos;s been with me since before my legal name change, but I&apos;ve never dealt with the company directly.
		A representative of my credit union set it up for me.
		They still think my old legal name is valid, so I need to get proper access to the account so I can update that information.
		As for the other account, my employer set it up for me recently, and I&apos;ve been unable to set up my access to it because it&apos;s done through a Web form that demands a telephone number.
		I need to get in touch with support and get the account fully set up.
	</p>
	<h3>Thursday and beyond</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;ll no doubt still have some organisation to do around my home.
		In particular, it&apos;d be great to get as much of my stacked-up paperwork taken care of as is feasible before the coming term starts.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="hair">
	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		Being unable to find gram flour, I continued with my hair-removal mud.
		However, comments on that other recipe suggested that the salt in the recipe makes a huge difference, so I added salt to the mud.
		I had the same slight skin irritation as yesterday, and again, not a single hair came off on the wash cloth.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the courses I&apos;ve been counting on to count for my associate degree are indeed still the courses I need.
		I spotted a change in the bachelor program pretty quickly: I need a &quot;1 course from a discipline other than the one the student is majoring in&quot;.
		During my second term, the school royally messed up though, and their system would only allow me to register for the two courses I&apos;d taken during my first term as well as a business course that I never wanted to take.
		Obviously, I went with the business course and no second course, as retaking courses I&apos;d passed would be a waste of time and money.
		That course is only needed for the business degrees, so it should count now as a course from a discipline other than my major, being that my major is computer science and not business.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I ran through the list of courses required for the degree, one by one marking them off if they were in my plan and skipping them if I&apos;d already completed them.
		By the end, I&apos;d found every required course was already in my plan or already completed.
		Furthermore, no courses in my plan hadn&apos;t been marked off.
		The courses I need haven&apos;t changed, yet for some reason, which courses need to be proctored <strong>*has*</strong>.
		Whatever then.
		That doesn&apos;t derail my degree in the slightest, it just rearranges when I need to take the courses slightly.
		And speaking of rearranging, I checked the prerequisites to see if there were any changes there that might alter when I need to take courses.
		I found the prerequisites had really been mixed up.
		The dependency chains didn&apos;t run quite as deep, and many bachelor-level courses that had previously depended on other bachelor-level courses now depend on associate-level courses that I had to complete already.
		If you&apos;ve been following my progress, you know I&apos;ve been actively working to target trunks in the dependency tree, leaving the severed leaf nodes for later.
		With the changes they&apos;ve made, I&apos;m down to two trunks.
		One&apos;s the <span title="Data Structures">CS 3303</span> course that acted as my only targetable trunk in my old plan.
		The other can only be taken after <span title="Data Structures">CS 3303</span>: <span title="Data Mining and Machine Learning">CS 4407</span>.
		This means two main things for me.
		First, the courses I chose for the coming term, which I had to choose half-blind (as I had my plans based on the past dependency tree in front of me, but I hadn&apos;t worked out the current dependency tree) and in a rush, is just fine according to my new plan.
		I need to take <span title="Data Structures">CS 3303</span>, just as I thought.
		Next term, I&apos;ll need to take <span title="Data Mining and Machine Learning">CS 4407</span>.
		Second, after these next two terms, I won&apos;t have to think about dependency trees at all.
		All dependencies in my program will have been satisfied, and I can take the rest of the courses in whatever order they seem to be available in.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a side note, next term&apos;s required course in a proctored one; next term will be a proctored term.
		According to my old plan, I needed an unproctored course/term, so as my academic advisor had waited until the last minute to help me and <span title="Web Programming 2">CS 3305</span> had filled up, I&apos;d have to wait two terms to take it, despite it being something I&apos; wanted to take this term.
		Instead though, I can take it next term.
	</p>
	<p>
		With all that in mind, I need the following courses to complete my degree:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span title="Data Structures">CS 3303</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span title="Analysis of Algorithms">CS 3304</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span title="Information Retrieval">CS 3308</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span title="Data Mining and Machine Learning">CS 4407</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span title="Artificial Intelligence">CS 4408</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			All of these: <span title="Web Programming 2">CS 3305</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>, <span title="Databases 2">CS 3306</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>, <span title="Operating Systems 2">CS 3307</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>, <span title="Comparative Programming Languages">CS 4402</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>, <span title="Software Engineering 2">CS 4403</span>, <span title="Advanced Networking and Data Security">CS 4404</span>, <span title="Mobile Applications">CS 4405</span>, <span title="Computer Graphics">CS 4406</span>, <span title="Calculus">MATH 1211</span>, <span title="Discrete Mathematics">MATH 1302</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			four electives
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Next term is set in stone unless the school pulls something odd at the last minute.
		They haven&apos;t done anything like that in past terms though.
		I&apos;m also certain of what I want to take the term after.
		That&apos;ll leave me with two proctored courses remaining.
		I might as well get all the proctoring out of the way, so I think I&apos;ll take those remaining courses after that.
		My plan for the next three terms is as follows:
	</p>
	<ol start="0">
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span title="Data Structures">CS 3303</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span title="Comparative Programming Languages">CS 4402</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span title="Data Mining and Machine Learning">CS 4407</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span title="Web Programming 2">CS 3305</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span title="Databases 2">CS 3306</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span title="Operating Systems 2">CS 3307</span><em title="(proctored course)">*</em>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		I guess I wouldn&apos;t mind taking <span title="Advanced Networking and Data Security">CS 4404</span> and/or <span title="Mobile Applications">CS 4405</span> after that, but I want to keep my options open, so I won&apos;t plan beyond those next three terms yet.
