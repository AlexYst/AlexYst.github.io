	<h2>Early</h2>
	<p>
		I mentioned last night that I&apos;d head to Eugene to clock my travel time late that night, or more precisely, early this morning just after midnight.
		Once I was ready to head out though, I just couldn&apos;t bring myself to actually go.
		Doing this in the dark, where I can&apos;t even properly read street signs to navigate just isn&apos;t the best idea.
		I&apos;m going to have to do this tomorrow morning, meaning I&apos;ll have to make the trip twice that day.
		It&apos;s going to be tiring, but it&apos;s not like clocking the journey at night will even grant me accurate results.
		I&apos;d be much slower in the dark.

	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Work was stressful today.
		Yesterday we were busy, so morning crew had to replenish the depleted supply we keep in the refrigerator.
		In addition, they had to make a bunch of extra dough.
		I guess we&apos;re expecting to need more than usual tomorrow?
		I don&apos;t know.
		(We don&apos;t use it same-day; it&apos;s got to sit there long enough to rise.)
		Apparently, one of morning crew&apos;s members was messing around and getting in the way, slowing everyone down too.
		Long story short, the dough-making process extended long beyond the time frame it was supposed to, and as a result, nothing else really got done.
		Evening crew, those working my shift, therefore started out already behind for the day.
		Today was busy too, so while trying to catch up, we were bombarded with orders that kept us from actually making progress.
		In the end, we actually had to stay over an hour after work to finish closing the store; we left the building a while after midnight.
		I&apos;m glad I was there though; that I ended up assigned this shift when I was supposed to have the day off.
		It would&apos;ve gone worse without me.
