	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve thought about it more, and actually, I could construct seven of the hubs using only materials from the given plant they represent; no added mineral to block fires.
		I hadn&apos;t thought about it before, but <code>renew</code> adds a recipe for crafting dirt (or rather, compost that breaks down into dirt) from leaves.
		I just don&apos;t remember that recipe most of the time because I don&apos;t really like it.
		It&apos;s a perfectly valid recipe, I just don&apos;t like losing my valuable leaves to make dirt when I have an excess of dirt most of the time (read: after the initial period in which I have an extreme shortage of dirt if my real estate happens to be ocean surface and I need to grow trees).
		I prefer to convert the leaves into much-needed saplings for use in growing decorative trees along the tunnel walls.
		I&apos;m not sure I like building the outer layer out of dirt though, even if I do use dirt I&apos;ve dug up underground instead of wasting my leaves to create it.
		If someone digs right up to the tunnel&apos;s edge and it&apos;s made of dirt, they&apos;ll hit a strange dirt wall instead of something more obviously human-constructed.
		For that reason, I think I&apos;ll still use a mineral barrier instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, maybe not.
		I&apos;ve also been thinking about fixing up the incomplete protection <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> though a mod.
		First off, falling nodes ignore protection.
		Much of my construction planning revolves around building the right constructs to block damage in important parts of the build from damage caused by falling nodes and fire.
		Falling nodes are defined as entities in the core Lua code of the game.
		In other words, they should account for the possibility of protected areas like the rest of the core Lua code.
		<code>fire</code> is admittedly a mod, so the core scripts shouldn&apos;t account for it, but the fire mod itself should properly account for protected areas.
		Instead, it only sort of half accounts for them.
		It won&apos;t let you use the flint and steel tool to start fires in protected areas, but it lets hot nodes ignite fires.
		That means that if someone dumps lava just outside your protected region and it flows in, it can start a fire.
		You&apos;re not actually protected from fire.
		Likewise, if you build in a forest or near some other flammable thing, someone can start a forest fire outside your zone and it&apos;ll make its way to your build and destroy it.
		The only way to be safe is to build an ugly barrier around your build out of something that won&apos;t catch fire.
		Falling nodes can even be used to build ledges that allow spreading liquids such as lava into place you thought you liquid-proofed.
		You really do have to be thorough.
		It takes away from both the beauty and the fun of your build.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure I can protect against flowing liquids in a clean way, especially as flowing liquids may be used as a legitimate part of a build, such as the construction of a waterfall or stream.
		However, I think I&apos;ve figured out the premise behind how I want to protect against fire and falling nodes.
		The main issue I&apos;d had with figuring out good fire protection before was that I didn&apos;t want to enable strange builds that, for example, used lava containment vessels made from wood, but I think I&apos;ve got it figured out now.
		For falling nodes, the falling &quot;node&quot; entity will be converted into a dropped item instead of a node if it lands in a protected space.
		For igniters, they&apos;ll be checked to see if they&apos;re liquid when they try to start a fire in a protected area.
		If they&apos;re liquid, they&apos;ll be treated as lava and cooled into stone.
		This is made straightforward to code thanks to a bug fix in Minetest Game 0.4.17.
		By converting liquid igniters into stone instead of removing them, we avoid having new ignition liquid constantly flowing in and disappearing.
		If the igniter isn&apos;t a liquid, it simply vanishes.
		This takes care of stray fire nodes, for example, without creating a stone mess everywhere.
		The stone mess just changes the nature of the vandalism instead of completely preventing it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unless I&apos;m forgetting something, this&apos;ll prevent all vandalism in properly-protected areas except for that done by simply putting liquids where people don&apos;t want them and that of wrapping someone&apos;s flammable build in a stone encasing, but I don&apos;t see those as fixable at this time.
	</p>
	<p>
		With fire no longer a threat, my excuse for theming each hub on a mineral as well as a plant is lost.
		I can just construct wooden/cotton/straw tunnel shafts.
		The more I thought about this, the more I liked the idea.
		First off, it&apos;ll allow me to get the first hub constructed much more quickly; I won&apos;t have to dig enough of whatever material I end up using out of the ground.
		Most likely, I&apos;d end up using coal for the first hub just because it&apos;d be the mineral I&apos;d be able to gather the quickest.
		Second, last time I was working in a world alone, I was having trouble gathering enough diamonds.
		I couldn&apos;t even get enough to supply my pick use, let alone save up enough to coat a short tunnel segment with.
		My plan has been to build the diamond-based tower second to last to try to buy time to try to get my diamond supply up.
		I no longer have to worry about that.
		I&apos;ve also been wresting with trying to get a third theme into some of the hubs so all twenty-three mining statistics can be represented in one of the hubs each, and that has been a planning nightmare.
		I don&apos;t have to worry about that now any more either.
		Each hub can be purely plant-themed.
		Now I just need to finish deciding which giant plant will be used for which hub based on the surrounding environments.
		The hard part is that there are multiple good locations for some trees, while multiple locations seems perfect for only one tree and it&apos;s the same tree in multiple places.
		Some giant plants are just going to have to look a bit out of place and there&apos;s nothing I can do about that.

	<h2>Driving instruction</h2>

		I&apos;ve scheduled my next driving instruction session for Tuesday at 11:00.

<section id="EUGLUG">
	<h2>The <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		It seems that joining the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> hinges on a background check.
		To join, I&apos;d have to supply my Social Security number, and I&apos;m not comfortable with that.
		I&apos;m sorely disappointed.
		I very nearly cried.
		I was excited both to finally join a Linux user group and to have a group of any sort of like-minded people where I could potentially make some friends.
		Some people in <a href="ircs://freenodeok2gncmy.onion:6697/%23GayGeeks">#GayGeeks</a> confirmed my suspicion that requiring a Social Security number to join a Linux user group isn&apos;t standard practice, and in fact is very hokey.
		It looks like neither is likely to happen any time soon though.
		Additionally, I&apos;m now guaranteed Thursday evenings off, which will likely mean I get most if not all entire Thursdays off.
		When school is in session, having Thursday be one of my days off is highly inconvenient.
		I should be used to this by now.
		Nothing ever works out well.
