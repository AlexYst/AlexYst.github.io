	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was playing a video game on an old, legacy console.
		Vanessa was really young and got offended by something one of the bosses had said.
		I wasn&apos;t convinced the boss had actually said anything rude, but she went and got out mother to make me turn off the game.
		The boss killed me, so I went to try to re-fight it, and show our mother what the boss had actually said, but it turned out the boss was randomised and I ended up with a different one.
		I couldn&apos;t pause the game mid-fight, the game wasn&apos;t set up that way, but after losing again, I put down the controller to go look up a video of the boss so our mother could see.
		As I turned to leave the room and go get my laptop, Vanessa shut off my game, undoing the progress I&apos;d made.
		I&apos;d have to make my way to the boss all over again.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was actually this startling me that woke me up, and I think I said &quot;Hey!&quot; in the waking world instead of the dream world.

		I got my final final exam for the term taken.
		Yay.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		It seems Minetest 0.4.17 was released about a week ago.
		I was under the false impression that 0.4.* was done and we were moving to 0.5.0 next.
		However ... it seems the new features of Minetest Game are only going to be made available in 0.5.0, most likely.
		For example, the two new flowers (one black and one green) and the new <code>firefly</code> mod, despite being compatible with Minetest 0.4.17 (and 0.4.16, in fact), are not included in Minetest Game 0.4.17 for some reason.
		Many bug patches are included, but it doesn&apos;t look like anything else is.
		I really looks like work in Minetest Game is mostly being geared toward the 0.5.0 release, meaning it still might come soonish.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over the past several days, I&apos;ve been reformulating my nine-tower Minetest world plan.
		Last I mentioned, I was planning to build nine towers in the Minetest world, one after another, building tunnels to connect them as I went.
		Each tower would serve as a sort of tunnel hub for that ninth of the map.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few days ago, I decided to build each vertical tunnel segment connecting the hub tower to the tunnel network not out of the same cobble as the rest of the network, but out of two more interesting materials.
		The outer materiel would be some sort of minable mineral, compressed into blocks.
		This layer would serve to protect against fires, as the <code>fire</code> mod doesn&apos;t respect the presence of protected areas.
		The inner layer would be flammable, but more interesting to look at.
		It&apos;d be constructed from nodes of some crop, tree, or bush.
		In the case of the pine-based hub, the outer layer wouldn&apos;t be composed of a mineral, but of snow grown on the pine trees the inner layer would be built from.
		The hub towers would likely be constructed from the plant material as well, though not necessarily.
		They&apos;d be exposed and flammable, but a sort of fire-proof lock chamber at the ends of the tunnels would prevent sand, fire, and liquid from reaching the actual tunnel.
		As players request tunnels to their builds, the tunnels they requested would be topped in the normal cobble material instead of the fancier material unless they wanted to supply building materials, as I just won&apos;t have the time to gather plant matter for everyone, and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll have enough minerals either, depending on how many tunnel requests I get.
		The further out the requests, the more minerals I&apos;ll get along the way, but for closer tunnel entrances, it wouldn&apos;t at all be feasible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I came up with a better idea for the hub towers themselves: I&apos;ll build larger versions of the tree/bush/crop used in the tunnel!
		It&apos;s always been the intent that these hubs become sort of city centres.
		Assuming the world last long enough to even see the construction of the second hub, the spawn area will have become crowded; developed into a likely-cobbled-together city of sorts.
		Moving the spawn point to a new area would give new players a chance to build near the spawn area where their creations will be seen, and will allow the clearing out of things built by departed players without actually having to delete them; those builds will still be available to visit.
		One of the features of the original iteration of the tunnel project, or at least the original tunnel-based (as opposed to bridge-based) version of the project, was that it was intended that the spawn point would be moved upon completion of a tunnel segment in order to start with a fresh slate again.
		Most of my later tunnel project plans have kept this feature.
		Having a giant tree in the middle of the spawn area seems like a pretty cool idea to me!
		That said, wheat and cotton also get hubs; there aren&apos;t enough trees and bushes in the game to simply skip over them.
		The giant cotton plant will be ... okay, I guess.
		I&apos;ll dye cotton blocks and build a cotton-plant-shaped structure out of them.
		The wheat hub though ... I doubt many people will recognise the giant wheat plant built out of straw blocks as being a wheat plant.

	<h2>Dental appointment</h2>
	<p>
		I really needed to get out today, so I looked for something, <strong>*anything*</strong> that could give me an excuse to bike somewhere and back.
		Then I remembered the dental appointment I need to set up.
		Last time I had work done, the dentists&apos; office said they&apos;d mail me some sort of prompt to get an appointment that would arrive about mid-April, so I would get my post-filling teeth looked at.
		They never sent it.
		Between the fact that they refused to let me make the appointment that day before I left, the fact that the prompt never arrived, and the fact that I wasn&apos;t eager to return after the dentist ground away the tooth ridge I&apos;d specifically told them twice not to, I haven&apos;t gone in to make said appointment yet.
		I still haven&apos;t heard back from the insurance people though ...
		They&apos;ll probably do something hokey like always, and I&apos;ll likely lose my coverage.
		I need to get this done as soon as possible.
		Plus, I have that one tooth that became infected as predicted, and a couple of my other teeth hurt again sometimes.
		The infected tooth was probably inevitable, but I&apos;m not convinced the patch job on the other teeth was well-done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, so I biked in to make the appointment.
		They told me they&apos;d stopped mailing the post card prompts, so I guess they didn&apos;t even think to send them to the people they&apos;d already arranged to send them to.
		Also, it seems they deleted my email address on file, so I gave them that again.
		It seems they don&apos;t issue appointment prompts via email though, they refuse to issue them via any method besides telephony.
		That&apos;s pretty bogus.
		Not everyone has or wants telephone service, so if you&apos;re going to tell your patients they can&apos;t make their distant appointments right away and have to wait for a prompt, make your prompt available via multiple channels!
		I&apos;m less than amused.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, my appointment will be on June 15 at 09:20.
