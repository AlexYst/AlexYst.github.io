			<h1><code>iptables</code></h1>

<section id="iptables">
	<h2><code>iptables</code></h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been struggling with trying to figure out <code>iptables</code> on and off for <strong>*months*</strong>.
		It&apos;s probably been about a year now.
		Thunderbird has that Torbirdy plugin, but it keeps disabling it, which causes traffic to be sent out over a clearnet connection without warning and without a way to prevent it.
		If Thunderbird would just <strong>*disable all traffic*</strong> when it disables the plugin, everything would be fine.
		But it doesn&apos;t.
		In general, my machine should never be sending data over the clearnet, so I thought <code>iptables</code> could help me.
		No one would help me figure out how to use it though (not that it was their job to do so), and the guides I found confused me at the time.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few days ago, finally, I managed to piece enough of it together to get what I thought to be a working set of rules.
		The first thing to know is that <code>iptables</code> isn&apos;t configured by editing a configuration file as I thought it was; each <code>iptables</code> line is actually a command line command.
		With my rule set, I was finally able to get some help, and they confirmed that you do indeed enter the lines as commands.
		They also recommended I add a line at the end.
		I haven&apos;t had time to have my computer potentially be out of commission if I messed something up, so I couldn&apos;t actually test out the rules right away.
		At the time, I forgot to add a rule to allow connections to <code>lo</code>, so I added that in today, then once I tested everything, I duplicated the commands and added a <code>6</code> to the second set, using <code>ip6tables</code> instead of <code>iptables</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Everything seems to be in order, I think.
		I do wonder what services will get cut off though.
		For example, the date- and time-updating code doesn&apos;t know a proxy has to be used, so they system won&apos;t be updating the clock to match network time any more.
		Is there a way to get it to update over <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>?
		Not sure.
		Anything over <abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr> is no longer going to work either.
		I did test an installation after the rules were put in place too, so I know the package manager is set up properly to work over <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>.
		It&apos;s been set up that way since I first set up the machine, but I wasn&apos;t sure id there were any <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> leaks there, which would now result in failed <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> queries.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, for now, here is my ruleset.
		It seems to block all non-<abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> traffic while allowing all <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> traffic, which is exactly what I&apos;m after:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
<pre>sudo iptables --policy OUTPUT DROP
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --match owner --uid-owner debian-tor --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --out-interface lo --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --jump REJECT
sudo ip6tables --policy OUTPUT DROP
sudo ip6tables --append OUTPUT --match owner --uid-owner debian-tor --jump ACCEPT
sudo ip6tables --append OUTPUT --out-interface lo --jump ACCEPT
sudo ip6tables --append OUTPUT --jump REJECT</pre>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I mentioned an installation I used to test the package manager with.
		That installation was for the <a href="apt:iptables-persistent"><code>iptables-persistent</code></a> package, which saves <code>iptables</code> rules.
		Upon first installing it, it&apos;ll let you save the current rules.
		Updating the rules later isn&apos;t automatic, and requires some command to be run.
		I don&apos;t remember the command, but I did see it online, so I can look it up when I need to.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next step is to get the Librem set up.
		I waited to set up <a href="/en/domains/taylor.local.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a> for use, knowing I wanted these <code>iptables</code> rules in place from the very beginning.
		I&apos;m going to need to figure out what to do about captive portals though.
		I guess I need a way to temporarily disable the non-<abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> traffic block, but I&apos;m not sure how to do that just yet.
		I might wait to get <code>taylor</code> set up until I have a working solution on that front.
		Then again, maybe what I need isn&apos;t a way to use captive portals.
		Maybe what I need is to actually set up a home Internet connection, so I don&apos;t have to deal with the local captive portals at my complex.
		It&apos;s long overdue, and would allow me to finally have my own Minetest server again.
		Of course, then I need to find a way to allow connections to the local network without allowing connections to the full Internet, as Minetest runs over <abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr> and cannot be reached via <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>.

<section id="job_hunt">
	<h2>Job hunt</h2>
	<p>
		I can&apos;t explain the details here, but it looks like there are some complications preventing me from job hunting for now.
		I&apos;m hoping to have these issues resolved in a few days, but progress seems to be stupidly slow.
		I could expedite the process and be done today, but it&apos;d cost a bunch of money.
		As I&apos;m trying to make money, not lose money, it seems like a better idea to wait and see how things play out first.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="EUGLUG">
	<h2><abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		Being unable to progress on the job front, I instead looked into meeting up with the local Unix/Linux user group, <a href="https://euglug.org/"><abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr></a>.
		They don&apos;t distribute their meet-up location on the Web though, so you have to inquire via email about it.
		Hopefully they&apos;ll respond by the next meeting I don&apos;t have to work through.
		Meetings are on Thursdays, and I really need to get out of the apartment more and meet like-minded people, so I&apos;m going to tell my boss I&apos;m no longer available to work on Thursday evenings.
		Honestly, I debated back and forth about this.
		I feel bad limiting when the boss can schedule me for, but I do deserve to have a life outside of work and school.
		Even if I didn&apos;t though, my boss doesn&apos;t deserve me at their beck and call.
		They won&apos;t even do their own job and stand up for their employees, myself included, so why should I go out of my way to make myself available for them?
		Honestly, if they were a decent boss, I probably wouldn&apos;t have the heart to set limits on my work schedule.
		I still do have to work this coming Thursday though, and due to not having given the boss enough warning, it&apos;s possible I&apos;ll need to work the Thursday after that.
