	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I finally wrote the fire protection and falling &quot;node&quot; protection into the <code>blockprotectnodes</code> mod.
		In theory, this protection should be provided in the <code>fire</code> mod and built-in scripts, respectively, but it isn&apos;t.
		If I&apos;m going to make running an anarchy-based server work, such protection is vital.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve also looked up the necessary functionality in Minetest for converting schematic files into a somewhat human-readable form.
		I&apos;ve known for a while now that the best way to make the giant trees at the tunnel hubs turn out right would be to better understand the contents of the schematic files.
		The only other way is through growing hundreds of trees and looking for the tree that meets its fullest potential of the group.
		There&apos;s no guarantee the best tree I find though would actually be the best tree possible.
		For that, analysing the schematic contents is just the only way.
		It&apos;d be best if, for example, I used the tallest possible version of the tree as my model for constructing the giant version, for an even more giant tree.
		More importantly though, some trees have a very tall maximum hight, such as jungle trees, and finding the right elevation to plant them at hinges on my being able to correctly identify (or guess) the maximum hight they&apos;ll grow as to keep them within the boundaries of the tunnel.

	<h2>Ranch dressing recipe</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve tried adding ten grams of flour and five grams of vinegar to my <a href="/en/recipe/ranch_dressing.xhtml">ranch dressing recipe</a>.
		I let it sit for several hours without it separating, but I won&apos;t consider the results conclusive until I&apos;ve let it sit overnight.
