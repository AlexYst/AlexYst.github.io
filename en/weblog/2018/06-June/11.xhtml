<section id="EUGLUG">
	<h2>The <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		It seems the demand for a Social Security number was just one of the members messing with the new person.
		It&apos;s not actually needed.
		I was basically getting hazed.
		I don&apos;t even think a background check is even being run at all, with or without a Social Security number.
		Come to think of it, the <a href="ircs://freenodeok2gncmy.onion:6697/%23EUGLUG"><code>#EUGLUG</code></a> channel is on Freenode, a network that discriminates against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users.
		To connect via <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>, you must first create an account without using <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>; or so is their intent.
		Their actual configuration is buggy though, so their whitelist overlaps with the list of <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> exit nodes.
		If you try enough exit nodes, you&apos;ll find one that allows you to get through, which is what I did.
		Once you have that account, every time you connect through the back door entrance they require <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users to use (<abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users aren&apos;t allowed in the front door), they flag you as a <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> user via your host mask.
		I&apos;d just connected, so my host mask was still highly visible in the channel, to anyone actually paying attention to that sort of thing.
		The person messing with me likely predicted I was sensitive about that sort of thing and used the opportunity to prank me.
		Well played.

<section id="repair">
	<h2>Repair</h2>
	<p>
		My faucet has had a leak for a several weeks.
		I told the on-site manager about it a few weeks ago and asked if I could replace it if I could find one that fit.
		They instead said they&apos;d send maintenance to fix it.
		Previously, the leak was spraying pretty far, and it&apos;d been doing that for a few weeks, but a few days after I was told maintenance would drop by, the leak changed from a spray to a dribble.
		I assumed maintenance had dropped by while I wasn&apos;t home and had attempted to fix the leak, but hadn&apos;t actually put any real effort in and as a result, hadn&apos;t actually fixed it fully.
		But a few days ago, a repair company contacted me to arrange an appointment.
		They hadn&apos;t been by and the leak has somehow gotten weaker.
		Maybe it&apos;s rusted shut a bit?
		Anyway, their appointment was for today, but they never showed.
		I wrote to them about it, but there was no reply.
		This is ... really unprofessional.
		I had errands I wanted to run today and couldn&apos;t because I was stuck waiting at home.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="busy">
	<h2>Busy</h2>
	<p>
		I just realised at work today that this is sort of a busy week for me.
		It&apos;s a good sort of busy though.
		Waiting for the repair person was a bust, but I also have a driving lesson and two trips to Eugene on the agenda.
		(The first trip is to try to find a certain doughnut shop and make my way to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> location so I know where I&apos;m going the next day,  can time it and know how early to leave home, and can bring introductory doughnuts.)
		I also have some grocery shopping I need to get done, as well as my Tuesday errands; I won&apos;t be able to complete both in one trip due to lack of time on Tuesday (tomorrow), with the driving lesson scheduled for that day.
		This is close to what I think life should be like: busy enough to prevent boredom and prevent me from sitting around home all day, but not so busy that I can hardly breathe.
		And no (or almost no) drudgery such as my university has devolved the learning process into.
		(I&apos;m between terms at the moment.)
