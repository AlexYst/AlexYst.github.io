<section id="repair">
	<h2>Repair</h2>
	<p>
		I finally made time to patch up my rainbow heart tee-shirt that I ripped last year.
		With that sewing machine being much lower quality than I&apos;d anticipated, I didn&apos;t trust it with that shirt, so I made the repair by hand.
		I didn&apos;t go over the new seam two to three times I like I usually do though.
		Normally, I guess I&apos;m more worried about the seam giving way.
		This time though ...
		This shirt&apos;s fabric is incredibly thin.
		It&apos;s one of my favourite shirts, but it was constructed from low-quality fabric.
		I mean, it was being used as a promotional item given out to get people to take gratis <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> tests.
		The sponsor was losing money in this endeavour, so of course they chose to pay less for the building of the promotional tee-shirts and chose thinner fabric.
		Anyway, I think the fabric is more likely to rip again than the seam come undone, so I only went over the seam once.
		It didn&apos;t show as badly as I thought considering the prominent location of the rip, even if the rip was very close to one of the original seams.
		To help hide it, I did stitch through in a spot that leaves only a thin hold, making this an even weaker patch job.
		Still, I think it should hold well enough.

<section id="instruction">
	<h2>Driving instruction</h2>
	<p>
		There seems to be some regression in my driving skills.
		When I was working with my volunteer driving instructor, I think I got parking in parking spaces down pretty well.
		Today, when working with my paid driving instructor, I didn&apos;t do so well.
		I&apos;m starting to doubt the four lessons will be enough, too.
		I think their package deal assumes that the student will be practising at home, which is something I can&apos;t do, as I have no one to take me driving besides the paid instructor.
		Everyone abandoned me aside from the person literally paid <strong>*not*</strong> to abandon me.
		Honestly, I&apos;m over people crapping out on me as far as driving lessons, and I don&apos;t mean this as a complaint in that context.
		You can see though how I have no support network though, and that&apos;s where my complain lies.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="setback">
	<h2>Setback</h2>
	<p>
		I resolved my technical difficulties only to find that another layer of technical difficulties lies just under the first layer.
		It&apos;s probably going to take just as long to resolve this layer&apos;s problems as well.
		That means I still can&apos;t job hunt just yet.
		I&apos;m getting very restless about this.
		I want out of my current, terrible job!
	</p>
</section>
<section id="shift">
	<h2>A shift tomorrow</h2>
	<p>
		One of the bosses needed me to take on a shift another boss was scheduled for tomorrow.
		I&apos;d planned to use tomorrow to scope out the route to the doughnut shop and the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting location, but now that can&apos;t happen.
		At least not when I wanted it to.
		I don&apos;t know how long it&apos;ll take.
		I mean, the main point in scoping out the route early was to time it and get a sense of when I&apos;ll need to leave home on Thursday.
		As my new shift is a closing shift, I have the morning off still, but I can&apos;t leave for Eugene in the morning because I can&apos;t be sure I&apos;ll make it back in time for work.
		I can&apos;t just <strong>*not*</strong> make sure I can find the place or <strong>*not*</strong> make sure of how long it&apos;ll take to get there.
		That means I&apos;ll have to go tonight, after I finish writing this entry, just after midnight.
		Joy.
		Trying to find my way in the dark&apos;ll be just lovely, plus the shop won&apos;t be open so I can&apos;t inquire about how many vegan doughnuts they tend to keep on hand or even order ahead to make sure they have a couple dozen ready.
		I&apos;ll pretty much just be going in blind and hoping they have a bunch.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="K-strategy">
	<h2>K-strategy</h2>
	<p>
		I was thinking a lot today about humans as K-strategists and came to what I think are interesting conclusions.
		I don&apos;t have the time to explain tonight, but I do hope to write a short opinion piece about it at some point.
