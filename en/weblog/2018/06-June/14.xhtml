	<h2>Test run</h2>
	<p>
		The test run for my trip went about as well as my test runs for trips usually do, which is to say I got lost several times on the way there.
		I made it to my destination, but ended up taking a way-out-of-the-way route near the end.
		I used the trip back home to figure out the route I was supposed to have used the first time, and again got lost several times.
		I used up all my strength on that trip, and it really would have been nice to have gotten a chance to do this yesterday instead, so I&apos;d have a full day of rest before having to make the trip again.
		Instead, I got home about an hour before I needed to leave again.
		I&apos;d planned to take a relaxing bath to recharge my muscles, then have dinner, but there was no time for that.
		Instead, I had a quick shower and a small snack; a can of beans.
		There wasn&apos;t time to rest much.
	</p>

<section id="trip">
	<h2>The real trip</h2>
	<p>
		As planned, my fist stop was the doughnut shop.
		They asked what kind of doughnuts I wanted, saying they could make whatever kind I wanted fresh for me if they didn&apos;t have them.
		I explained that I didn&apos;t have time to wait, and said I&apos;d take two dozen of whatever vegan doughnuts they had, if they had them.
		The proceeded to look around, give me a strange discount for an unexplained reason, then headed out of sight.
		Of course, I assumed they were going to go put the doughnuts in boxes.
		What else could they be doing?
		I waited about half an hour, wondering how long it could possibly take to box doughnuts.
		Maybe a lot of customers were ahead of me; there were certainly a lot in the store.
		When they got back, they explained that I needed to be careful with one of the boxes, as they&apos;d just made them fresh for me and they were more easily damaged than the ones in the other box, as the other ones had set more.
		In other words, they hadn&apos;t listened to what I said, and instead of even telling me that they were going to have me wait, as they should have even if I hadn&apos;t explained that I didn&apos;t have time to wait, they just popped a batch in without even asking me if I was okay waiting.
		It turned out they&apos;d had one dozen ready, but not two dozen.
		No doubt, the discount was an attempt at an apology for making me wait without giving me the choice as to whether to wait or not; after all, they wouldn&apos;t want me opting out of the sale, would they?
		I ended up paying for both dozen, but had I had more time to think, I would have rejected the fresh ones, railed on them for having me wait even though I&apos;d explained I couldn&apos;t wait, and taken only the old doughnuts that I&apos;d&apos;ve bought if they&apos;d been upfront with me.
		They&apos;d made me severely late to my meeting and they shouldn&apos;t be rewarded with the sale of another dozen doughnuts for that, but at the same time, I needed that one dozen to explain my tardiness.
		Anyway, if I ever go to that shop again, it won&apos;t be for a great while.
		They&apos;ve cost themselves more business in the future than they gained tonight.
		It&apos;s too bad, too; they&apos;re the only doughnut shop I know that makes vegan doughnuts, so I won&apos;t be having any more doughnuts for quite a while.
		This was a terrible first impression though; today is the first time I&apos;ve ever visited the place.
	</p>
	<p>
		I expected lots of people at the meeting, though I wasn&apos;t sure exactly how many.
		Online, it appears the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> has over two hundred members, but as the meetings are at someone&apos;s house, that many people wouldn&apos;t fit very well.
		If they were all to attend, they&apos;d likely need to rent a space for the meeting, and perhaps have some sort of dues to cover the cost.
		My guess was that there&apos;d be over two dozen people though and I wouldn&apos;t be bringing enough doughnuts, but I can&apos;t afford many more than that, nor could I transport them on my bike.
		As it turned out though, there were only half a dozen attendees, including myself.
		It seems this is how the meetings usually turn out, too.
		What is even the point of being in a location-based Linux user group if you&apos;re not going to show up for the in-person meetings?
		If you&apos;re not attending in-person meetings, there&apos;s no reason to not instead join an online group with a more-diversely-located member list.
		You can get ideas from more places that way, or even choose a group that specialises more on something you&apos;re interested in.
		I was told beforehand the meetings are informal, but they were even less formal than I&apos;d imagined.
		No two of us shared a common activity, and there were often two separate conversations going at any given time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Doughnuts came up in conversation because I&apos;d brought some, and I mentioned how the people at the doughnut shop didn&apos;t know how to listen.
		The other members informed me that this is standard practice for that doughnut shop.
		It wasn&apos;t just a fluke, or me hitting one dumb employee.
		This is what they do.
		Again, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going back.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having had to make both trips in one day, I was exhausted by the time it came time for me to head home the second time.
		I couldn&apos;t bike the full way, and had to walk for long stretches.
		I ended up arriving home past midnight.
		It won&apos;t go that way next week though.
		Next week, I&apos;ll be able to take only the one round trip.
