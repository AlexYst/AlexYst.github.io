	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was trying to kill the pests I kept finding in my home.
		I&apos;m pretty sure I managed to off the two rats by hitting them with a large baking pan.
		Twice, I thought I&apos;d managed to take out the opossum in the same way, but both times, it was only playing dead.
		I didn&apos;t manage to catch it a third time before waking up.

		I&apos;ve made the next appointment for driving instruction; it&apos;ll be this Friday at 12:30.

	<h2>Ranch dressing recipe</h2>
	<p>
		I checked in on the results of last night&apos;s ranch dressing experiment, to find the separation has been significantly reduced.
		It still separates slightly though.
		I thought I needed to add more flour.
		The flour lessens the flavour though, so I was going to need to adjust other ingredients as well.
		For starters, I thought I needed less soy milk so I could add more vinegar without messing with the consistency as much.
		Plus more vinegar than soy milk I remove to restore the consistency when I add the flour.
		I thought garlic and onion levels may need to be increased as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later in the day though, I found separation had increased quite a bit.
		Flour might not work for this like I though it would.
		Oh, well.
		It was worth a try.
		I was told lecithin or cornstarch might work, so maybe I&apos;ll try those next.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I did some experimenting with the jungle tree schematic and found the maximum growth height to be seventeen metres.
		The tunnel height is only twelve metres, with a two-metre ceiling and two-metre floor, for a total of sixteen metres within my protected area.
		Jungle tree saplings will necessarily need to be planted such that their &quot;roots&quot;, exclusive to jungle trees, are visible from below the tunnel.
		They&apos;ll often grow up through the ceiling, and sometimes even past the ceiling.
		This isn&apos;t quite what I was wanting, but it was something I suspected might happen.
		I think all other tree varieties are shorter though, so it&apos;s only the jungle trees that I&apos;ve got to worry about in this regard.
	</p>
	<p>
		The terrain in the game world isn&apos;t quite what I was hoping for.
		For smaller projects, I could simply relocate, as great terrain for my hubs does exist.
		However, with the scale of the project being what it is, precisely-places hubs is key.
		I&apos;m not sure what to do about the wheat- and cotton-based hubs.
		Three of the four available locations for them are at sea level, and only one of the two crops could potentially take the remaining spot.
		I can either build the giant plants right there, wish means the lower two nodes of them will be underwater, or I can build a dirt cube to raise them up sixteen nodes, fourteen above sea level.
		Of course, a third option is to raise them only two nods, but then I have a strange, unused, fourteen-node high, empty space above the crop.
		It&apos;s doable, but I don&apos;t like it.
		I&apos;ll need to consider my options further.
		And until I know what my course of action is, I can&apos;t know where to put the crops on the map, and therefore can&apos;t find placements for the rest of the non-pine hubs.
		I can&apos;t even begin the project until this is decided.
