	<h2>Dental work</h2>
	<p>
		I really didn&apos;t want to go in to see the dentist today.
		I was still worn out from yesterday, and just wanted to stay home and rest.
		It was too late to reschedule though, and rescheduling would require a trip to the office anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I mentioned the several issues I&apos;ve been having.
		First, the fact that I&apos;m still frustrated the dentist ground away the tooth matter they&apos;d specifically asked me on two different occasions whether I&apos;d wanted it ground away and I&apos;d specifically stated that I didn&apos;t.
		They claimed the part ground away wasn&apos;t tooth matter as I&apos;d thought it was, and it was actually a badly-shaped filling.
		I ... have no way to know whether this is true or not.
		I mean, I would just trust the dentist not to lie to me, but then again, they lost my trust when they asked if I wanted something then did it anyway when I declined.
		Besides, the biggest issue isn&apos;t that they took away that tooth matter or filling matter, but that they first asked me if I wanted it gone, then removed it anyway without even talking to me about it.
		That&apos;s not okay.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, a couple painful spots.
		Most of the time, they don&apos;t hurt, but sometimes they do.
	</p>
	<p>
		Third, the new gap between two teeth.
		I&apos;m not overly worried, but since getting some teeth extracted, a gap has opened up between two of my teeth near the front of my mouth.
		I guessed I might need braces to fix it, and that&apos;s exactly what the dentist suggested.
		First they want to see if the issue goes away on its own though.
		I doubt it will, but I&apos;m also not really in a hurry to deal with the gap.
		It&apos;s an odd quirk in my mouth, but doesn&apos;t overly bother me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, since getting this last dental work done, but bite has been off, and when I chew, I occasionally hit my teeth together in a way that causes them to slip, grinding my top teeth against my bottom teeth.
		I can already feel the damage.
		The dentist confirmed the damage, so hopefully something will be done soon to prevent it from continuing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lastly, I talked about my previous ear infections and how they went away after the extraction of my infected teeth.
		I explained that I thought the infection had travelled from my teeth to my ear, and that removing the source of the infection had fixed the problem.
		However, I&apos;m now getting that same problem with the other ear, so that tooth they said would become infected very likely finally had.
		They seemed to agree this was likely the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve got an appointment scheduled now to deal with one of the temporary fillings removed and replaced with a more-permanent counterpart.
		It&apos;s going to take until July 14 for them to get to me though, and my appointment is at 10:10.
		After that, I can schedule the next dental work, which will very likely be the extraction.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I was tinkering with my tunnel flora plans, and decided on a decent configuration as to which hubs to put where.
		I still don&apos;t have the complete layout figured out, but I do have a set of conditions I want met:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The pine tree should be in the centre of the map.
		</li>
		<li>
			The other trees should be in the corners.
		</li>
		<li>
			The bushes should be on adjacent sides, and the jungle tree should be in the corner opposite of the corner where the bush sides meet.
		</li>
		<li>
			The above three rules combined implies that the jungle tree is next to both the cotton and wheat.
		</li>
		<li>
			The apple tree should be next to the &quot;apple&quot; bush.
		</li>
		<li>
			The acacia tree should be next to the acacia bush.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Once I get a chance to sit down with the map again, I can begin planning with these requirements in mind.
		I think once I have the layout worked out, I want to start the spawn area in the apple tree corner.
		An apple tree hollow seems like a good starting place, and the apple tree has been in Minetest Game for so long that it&apos;s pretty iconic.
