<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was an underage, African-American boy, and I&apos;d gotten my African-American girlfriend pregnant.
		She wasn&apos;t ready for a child, and I didn&apos;t want to have one ever.
		We were both pretty shaken up about it and jokingly decided to kill ourselves rather than just get an abortion.
		For some reason, her stomach changed to look just like my face, complete with a working mouth.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the first dream I can remember in which I wasn&apos;t in my own body.
		Strange.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="instruction">
	<h2>Driving instruction</h2>
	<p>
		I did much better this time than last time.
		I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;ve gotten used to the strange sensitivity threshold of the peddles, or if the peddles in this instructor&apos;s vehicle are in better repair than those in the last instructor&apos;s.
		Either one wouldn&apos;t surprise me too much.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="work">
	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		This is the third time I&apos;ve seen the person-in-charge since I last wrote about how they claimed they&apos;d do their job and straighten out the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> mess.
		However, they still admit having done nothing at all about it.
		And of course, they caused part of the problem to begin with by ignoring my initial change-of-address paperwork.
		I swear, no one is reliable.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was tired when I wrote yesterday&apos;s entry.
		I said I had to work this coming Thursday and I might have to work this next Thursday as well, as I hadn&apos;t given the boss enough time to take my availability change into account.
		The boss likes to have about a week&apos;s notice, but ignoring that, they post the schedule on Fridays, which would be today, the day I planned to put in the availability change notice.
		The plan was to give notice after the new schedule had been posted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I was looking at <strong>*last*</strong> week&apos;s schedule on my bulletin board.
		I didn&apos;t even have <strong>*next*</strong> week&apos;s schedule until today; that was the one being posted.
		I didn&apos;t end up scheduled to work on Thursdays this coming week, so I&apos;m in the clear.
		No more Thursday evenings.
		The <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> still hasn&apos;t written back though, so ...
		I might not have the information needed to make the next meeding.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;d planned to take the final exams yesterday, and in fact, I had time to do so.
		However, I got distracted and forgot to actually do it.
		I took both practice exams today, but only had time for one of the actual final exams.
		I&apos;d better remember to actually take the other one tomorrow.
		If I forget, I&apos;ll only have one more day before it becomes too late.
		There shouldn&apos;t be any problem though.
