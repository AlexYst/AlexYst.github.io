	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		School starts back up tomorrow, and I&apos;ve already begun feeling the lethargia setting in again these past few days.
		I&apos;m not looking forward to this.
		To be honest, I don&apos;t remember what I&apos;m studying this term, but I remember it wasn&apos;t what I&apos;d planned to study, due to the university&apos;s wonky setup.

		I realised two things about my current tunnel project plans today.
		First, with the jungle trees being as tall as they are, I already knew the light-emitting node they needed in order to grow from a sapling would need to be set into the floor instead of set on top of the floor.
		However, I hadn&apos;t thought about the implications of this until today.
		The issue is that it means the wheat or cotton plants I was planning to grow around those same lights would <strong>*also*</strong> need to be set into the ground.
		They won&apos;t provide much decorative function that way unless I make the floor thinner, which would bring the lights, cotton, and wheat back out of the floor.
		I don&apos;t like the idea of the thin floors though.
		It&apos;s inconsistent unless I also make the floors in the rest of the tunnel network thinner, as well as probably the ceilings and walls.
		I like the thick walls because they (except in the case of the jungle tree areas) provide an inner layer that can be adjusted to be whatever I need, such as dirt to grow plants on and gravel for decoration, and an outer layer that can remain both uniform and support falling nodes such as said gravel.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been trying to figure out which hub to put where, but I&apos;ve failed to take into account when I&apos;ll actually come across each plant starter I&apos;ll need to build the hubs.
		It doesn&apos;t help to plan for the first hub to be the apple tree hub if there aren&apos;t any apple trees around to sample a sapling from.
		Whatever the second hub is, I&apos;ll need to find its starter at the first hub&apos;s location too, as the tunnel between the two hubs will feature both plants and I&apos;ll be building the tunnel to reach the next hub as soon as the first hub is built.
		From then on, I&apos;ll need to make sure I can get each new plant starter at some point before the hub that&apos;s themed around it.
		I&apos;ll need to make a list of what I can get by what point and use that in making my decisions.
		It helps too that I know the order in which I want to build the hubs, by location.
		The final hub will be in the centre.
		The centre is just the best ending location for so many reasons.
		As for the outer hubs though, the southern one is different from the others in that it rests on a tallish mountain, and the second-to-last hub will be the one it takes the longest to move away from, so I think it&apos;d be poetic to have it be the one at a different elevation than the others.
		I&apos;d also like to move clockwise around the map, not counter-clockwise, which sets the order of the remaining hubs.
		When I have time, I&apos;ll look into what starters can be found where.
	</p>
	<p>
		I might make the tunnel a bit deeper in the jungle tree area.
		I don&apos;t like the lack of consistency that would be involved, but it&apos;d solve the farm crop issue and the jungle trees themselves would look nicer, not being burrowed into both the floor and ceiling.
		I also need to look into the maximum hight of pine trees.
		I don&apos;t think pine trees are higher than twelve meters including the snow on top, but if they are, it&apos;s something I should be aware of early on. If they&apos;re going to give me problems like the jungle trees, I should account for that before planning any further.
