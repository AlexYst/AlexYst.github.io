<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed my parents thought I was sleeping around and were discussion what to do about it.
		Being an adult though, there was nothing they <strong>*could*</strong> do.
		But also, I was innocent, so there was that.
		I briefly considered showing them I have toys to take care of my urges to try to prove my virginity, but then realised that really wouldn&apos;t prove anything.
	</p>

<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		I started looking through job offers online, and decided I&apos;d only try for full-time positions.
		If I take a part-time job, there&apos;s a chance I&apos;ll end up getting less hours than I am now, which I can&apos;t afford to risk.
		I quickly found a data-entry job in which I&apos;d directly take information from medical patients, but they have a specific tying speed they want me to meet.
		I can probably hit that speed, but if they try clocking me, I&apos;ll have to reveal my poor typing form.
		I&apos;ve been meaning to fix that for years now.
		I guess now&apos;s as good a time as any to start working on that.
		Once more, I&apos;ve painted my keyboard as a reminder of what fingers to use for each key, this time with some fingernail polish I had lying around.
		I don&apos;t remember why I quit last time, but hopefully this time, I see it through.
		For now, I don&apos;t want to apply for that job though.
		The next several journal entries may be shorter than usual, as typing this way is currently slow and laborious.
		My fingers can&apos;t keep up with my thoughts, so I&apos;ll forget things before getting them down on virtual paper.
		Then again, my entries when school is in session and I&apos;m suffering from despair are pretty short, so maybe you won&apos;t notice.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of the better-looking jobs asked for typing skills.
		I was temped to postpone the job hunt and just focus on typing practice.
		I mean, people have wasted so much of my time at this point that I&apos;m only one term away from having my associate degree.
		This job hunt isn&apos;t as practical as the one in January would have been.
		Would it be better to wait?
		I wasn&apos;t entirely sure I wasn&apos;t just making excuses though, so I applied for a job I am qualified for.
		I&apos;d&apos;ve applied for more, but this typing thing is really slowing me down for now.

<section id="IRA">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		The person in charge at work has been leaving me in the dark about the whole <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> situation, and has of course given me no way to contact them.
		They don&apos;t contact me about the situation, seeing as they don&apos;t care that I&apos;m having to deal with the mess they left me in without my consent.
		So I have to continually remind them to fix the situation under the thin guise of asking for a status update on the situation.
		I&apos;ve had little doubt for months though that they plan to blow me off forever.
		To make matters worse, I have no way to know when they&apos;ll be by the store, and every time they&apos;ve been by in the past while, I&apos;ve been running the drive-through and had a long line of customers.
		I haven&apos;t been able to talk to them, and after several minutes, they leave and I lose my chance.
		The windows of opportunity are miniscule, and I can&apos;t usually do anything about them.
		But today, I barely managed to get a word in with them, even though the head manager took up most of the available time with them when I didn&apos;t have customers.
		(To be clear, I&apos;m not blaming the head manager; they had business matters to discuss.)
		It seems my timing couldn&apos;t have been worse.
		The matter has, for completely unknown and unrelated reasons, been resolved.
		They&apos;ve switched to an entirely different <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company!
		It couldn&apos;t have been because of me though.
		All they had to do for me was take the time to contact support and have support correct the issue.
		They must&apos;ve run into other problems with that provider.
		I guess companies that suck tend to suck through and through.
		In any case, unless the new company has issues like the first one, my problem is resolved.
