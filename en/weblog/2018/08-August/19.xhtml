	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		The job hunt continues, but there&apos;s nothing to say about that.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I haven&apos;t touched a line of code today (aside from the code that builds this page, which is a hybrid of <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> and <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>), but I can&apos;t help but let my mind wander to Palette Game when I&apos;m stuck performing mindless, repetitive tasks.
		I made a breakthrough today.
		I realised that I&apos;ve been letting <code>minestats</code> hold back development already, and development has hardly begun!
		I&apos;ve been ruling out ideas I otherwise liked because they&apos;d necessarily me incompatible with <code>minestats</code>.
		Instead of <code>minestats</code> being a roadblock to overcome, it needs to be the engine that drives and inspires development!
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a pull request for Minetest I need to write that will allow paletted nodes to drop different items depending on their palette index.
		If and when accepted, the infrastructure will have exactly the feature I need <code>minestats</code> to be able to rely upon without holding back Palette Game development.
		An equivalent feature could be added on a per-node basis by the mods that use it, but in that case, <code>minestats</code> wouldn&apos;t be able to read and account for it.
		Before sending the pull request, I need to code <code>minestats</code> to handle it properly, as well as add a quickly-erasable section that causes <code>minestats</code> to <strong>*add*</strong> the feature for now, so it can rely on the presence of said feature.
		Best case scenario: the pull request is accepted, so I remove the then-redundant feature from <code>minestats</code>.
		Worst case scenario: The pull request is either rejected or sits in limbo, never getting accepted nor technically declined, so I have to label some of my mods as not operating correctly unless <code>minestats</code> is installed.
		<code>minestats</code> practically becomes a dependency for some of what will hopefully be some pretty cool stuff.
		People may be encouraged to either support the pull request or install <code>minestats</code>.
		And from my perspective, would either be a bad thing?
		Even if people end up just not installing the cool mods, it&apos;ll allow the development of my subgame to continue unhindered.
		I can&apos;t help but win with this strategy, no matter how cooperative others are or aren&apos;t.
		I&apos;ve already got the new Minetest <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> details worked out in my head too, just not the code that will implement them.
		It&apos;ll be seamless and definitely serve more than just my current use case.
