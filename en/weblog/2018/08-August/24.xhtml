	<h2>New credit union account</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve had all my apples in one basket ever since First Tech Federal pulled out of Springfield.
		Far too long.
		I finally decided on what new credit union I should set up a savings account at several days ago though: Selco.
		I had no way to know if an account there would have the usual problems I deal with in financial institutions, but signs were good.
		In particular, their website didn&apos;t appear to maliciously discriminate against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users, though neither does the website of that one noxious bank I dealt with recently until you try to log in.
		So today, I set about setting up an account there.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t get off to a great start.
		I forgot to bring the money and pay cheque I&apos;d need to deposit to start the account, even after I&apos;d deliberately avoided depositing those at Oregon Community last Tuesday.
		I had to run back home to grab them.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second visit appeared to go well.
		The credit union representative had the usual issue where the system won&apos;t let them leave the telephone number field blank.
		They kind of pressured me a little to use the number of someone I know, but when I cited distrust in those people, the issue was dropped and they entered ten zeroes as my number.
		Some institutions would have kept pushing until they found a number somewhere, such as by asking for a work number, not seeing that the problem is the number requirement, not the lack of a number.
		The representative also talked me into two more accounts: a checking account and a credit card account.
		I doubt I&apos;ll actually make use of the former for quite a while, but I guess it doesn&apos;t hurt to have it just in case.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much to my dismay, I found I was unable to register for online banking from home.
		The website sent me temporary passwords to the email address I had on file, but when I&apos;d enter those passwords, I was always redirected back to a page that looked like the homepage and had no visible confirmation or error message, but with a long, garbled-looking <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> that included the word &quot;error&quot;.
		I had no doubt that the site was maliciously discriminating against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users and not having the decency to give any solid indication of such, just like the bank from before, but additionally not having the decency to admit that there was an error occurring at all.
		I figured I&apos;d go in-branch to complain on Monday and have my suspicions confirmed.
		But then, within minutes of running into the problem, the representative that set up my account emailed me saying they&apos;d forgotten to give me back my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> after they&apos;d copied it.
		I can&apos;t believe I forgot they hadn&apos;t given it back myself!
		It was as much my own fault for not requesting it back as it was their own.
		In any case, I&apos;d need to make a third trip there today before work.
		I only had an hour and a half, but it&apos;s Friday, and I couldn&apos;t have my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> out of reach all weekend.
		There&apos;s a slim chance I might need it.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, I headed back.
		And while I was there, I complained that the website wasn&apos;t letting me set up online banking.
		Their solution was to set it up using the in-branch computer they had set up for members.
		That was a terrible idea.
		As I explained to them, it necessarily meant using an insecure password that I could remember long enough to get home and change, seeing as I was cut off from my password manager.
		And if the website continued acting up, I&apos;d be unable to change it at all, leaving me with an insecure password that any simple program could guess.
		My account would pretty much be just open, with the only real safeguard being the fact that most likely, no one would suspect the account of being open and attempt to get in.
		Still, until I tried this solution, I had no valid way to show that it wouldn&apos;t work and get them to look for a real solution.
		So I went with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once home, I quickly used what remaining time I had left before work to try to log in and change the password.
		The site prompted me for &quot;security&quot; questions and answers, but unlike common systems, the answers had to be chosen from drop down menus.
		Choosing actually-secure answers wasn&apos;t possible.
		Thankfully, setting these questions and answers was skippable.
		I figured after setting or skipping the questions, the lockout would occur.
		But ... that never happened.
		I can access the online banking interface normally, with the exception that I can&apos;t access the main profile settings, meaning that I can&apos;t change my password.
		So I&apos;m stuck with this insecure password for now.
		But I&apos;ve got to wonder: if the site&apos;s not actually discriminating against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users, why couldn&apos;t I set up the account from home?
		Anyway, I&apos;ll need to wait until Monday to get help with the password.
