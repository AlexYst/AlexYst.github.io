	<h2>Drudgery</h2>

		I finished the final exams as planned.
		I think I did decently on them, but I won&apos;t know my grades for sure until later.
		Tomorrow then, I&apos;ll begin the job hunt again.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

		I didn&apos;t want to think about Palette Game, seeing as I won&apos;t actually have time to work on it for a while, but my job is so mindless that I couldn&apos;t help coming up with new ideas on the job, especially while washing the dishes.
		First of all, I&apos;ve already known that the next step in Palette Game is to get the mod that defines freshwater, seawater, lava, stone, and cobble finished.
		Without that, I have no base to build off of.
		However, instead of thinking about that, I thought about the first of the tree-defining mods.
		I may have only one, but there&apos;s potential for more as well.
		Anyway, I&apos;ve decided to define eight types of naturally-occurring tree and bush.
		Each will offer players a different shade of wood.
		However, there will be mutagens, probably in the form of some radioactive mineral that can be dug up.
		If a sapling grows into a full tree within range of a mutagen, some of its leaves will mutate, causing different saplings to drop from them.
		These saplings will grow into trees that yield the same shade of wood, but have a different trunk look.
		They&apos;ll either take on the trunk texture of one of the other seven trees or they&apos;ll take on one of twenty-four trunk textures that can only be acquired through mutation, at leas one of which will come with an entirely different node shape.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;d planned to work on either the mineral-defining mod or the sapling-defining mod, then focus on the other, but it might be more beneficial to work on them in conjunction.
		That way, when a new idea for one arises, it can influence the other.
		For example, without the sapling idea, there&apos;s no need for a mutagenic mineral, while at the same time, without the mutagenic mineral, the sapling idea doesn&apos;t work out.
