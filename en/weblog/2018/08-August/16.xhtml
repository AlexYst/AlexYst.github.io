	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I was planning to take the final exams today, but I had to catch up on journal editing for the week instead.
		I&apos;d planned to get all the editing done yesterday.
		I thought it was <strong>*due*</strong> yesterday.
		But I didn&apos;t really have any energy, and didn&apos;t get my stuff done.
		Then today, I freaked out for a bit because I didn&apos;t even sign my warrant canary yesterday.
		Typically, if I fail to get an update completed right away, I at least get the canary signed by the deadline.
		After a bit, I remembered though that I&apos;m at term close.
		That means my update schedule is actually postponed a day, and is due today.
		So I&apos;m in the clear as far as the canary goes.
		However, after getting my update completed, there wasn&apos;t time to both take final exams <strong>*and*</strong> make it to the meeting tonight.
		And on top of that, I had to go talk to someone at a business that was hassling me yesterday about not having telephone service.
		That errand took about an hour and still has no resolution.
		I&apos;m scheduled to deal with them again on the seventh of next month.
	</p>
	<p>
		So yeah.
		I was supposed to be finished with the term today and start job-hunting tomorrow.
		Instead, I&apos;ll finish with the term tomorrow and start job-hunting the next day.
		Palette Game development will, of course, mostly be put on hold until I either get a new job or school starts back up.
		Of course, I&apos;ll still have time to work on Palette Game during my Thursday meetings.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		At the meeting, I finished up the <code>minestats</code> update, but didn&apos;t have time to test it.
		Likely, there are a few simple typos that&apos;d cause  the game to fail to start.
		Testing and typo-correction won&apos;t likely take long though, so I might do that during spare moments even as soon as tomorrow.
