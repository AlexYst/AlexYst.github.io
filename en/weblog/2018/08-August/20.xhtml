		I was dealing with warrantee claims all day before work and didn&apos;t have time to job hunt.
		I&apos;m not done either, and hope to finish tomorrow.

	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		The head manager gave me paperwork for the new <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> plan, given to them by the person in charge.
		I&apos;ll need to look through that and fill it out when I have time.
		Hopefully this company will actually make things reasonable.

		It occurred to me that because the engine handles liquid mechanics instead of this being done in Lua, the palette data from a palette-using liquid source probably can&apos;t be transferred to the flowing liquid node.
		A palette-based source node with a paletteless flowing node would look strange, effectively meaning liquids can&apos;t be coloured like other nodes.
		After further thinking, I thought I remembered that <code>param2</code>, used for storing a node&apos;s palette index, is also used for storing the liquid level of flowing liquids.
		When I got off work, I looked it up, and sure enough, that&apos;s exactly where liquid level is stored.
		Flowing liquids cannot be coloured, even through clever trickery, due to conflicting usage of <code>param2</code>.
		I&apos;ll need to cross coloured liquids off the plans for Palette Game.

	<h2>Goals</h2>

		The past couple days, I&apos;ve been a bit scatterbrained.
		Without school weighing me down, I have so many things I think I need to get dine before it starts again, but can&apos;t accomplish them all.
		I&apos;ve been trying to focus on the job hunt and typing practice, but other tasks have been threatening to take my attention from those projects.
		And of course, if I lose focus, I&apos;ll keep hopping between tasks and end up getting nothing dine before my time ends.
		Already, I keep remembering and forgetting why I can&apos;t or shouldn&apos;t tackle certain projects just yet.
		I figured out what I need to work on most now though: a goal list/timeline hybrid.
		The times won&apos;t be specific, but&apos;ll account for the order in which I&apos;ve got to do things.
		I&apos;ve got some time-sensitive stuff I&apos;ve got to deal with, such as the warentee claims I need to finish making, but after that, the first thing I&apos;ve got to do is build an itemised list of goals so I stay focussed.
