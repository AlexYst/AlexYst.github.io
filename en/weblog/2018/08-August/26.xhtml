	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>
		I picked up some protein powder, vitamin C tablets, carrots, and spinach today.
		I forgot to look into fibre though, which is also supposed to help with weight loss.
		<del>I think for now, my plan is to bring carrots, pickles, and spinach with me when I go to work as my dinners there.
		If I get desperate, I&apos;ll also allow myself a couple breadsticks.
		I&apos;ll probably mix things up a bit when I run out of carrots, and instead get something else such as celery.</del>
		I might bring in veggie patties to work sometimes as a treat, too.
		At home, I&apos;ll try to avoid particularly fattening foods, but will allow myself more variety and more-filling foods.
		<ins>Actually, scratch the part of the plan that involves scanty dinners at work.
		I tried that today, and I spent the whole work day not feeling great.
		I&apos;ll need to bring protein bars or veggie patties every day, probably.</ins>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>
		I finished up setting up my personal <a href="/en/a/goals.xhtml">goals</a> page.
		I planned to talk more about my plan of action today, but I guess I covered all the important stuff yesterday, aside from my dietary changes (covered above) and the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> stuff.
		All that needs to be said about the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> stuff is that I should get it taken care of tomorrow if I can.
