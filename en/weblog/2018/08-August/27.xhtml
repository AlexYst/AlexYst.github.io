			<h1>Sneaky credit union</h1>

<section id="credit">
	<h2>Credit card application</h2>
	<p>
		Sleco sent over the forms to sign to accept the credit card offer in the form of a link to a virtual signing webpage.
		However, they sent two forms to sign, not one: a life insurance sign-up form and the actual credit card sign-up form.
		Many people stupidly don&apos;t read, so they would have signed up for the life insurance accidentally, and started receiving bills for it whether they wanted it or not.
		Those sneaky bastards.
		Then, I found that when I signed <strong>*only*</strong> the appropriate form, the page wouldn&apos;t submit.
		I was <strong>*required*</strong> to sign up for live insurance to complete the sent version of the credit card application!
		To top it off, no options on the form were modifiable.
		I couldn&apos;t simply move the check over to the &quot;no insurance&quot; option.
		I had to write back to the credit union and ask what to do.
		Wow.
		They never even asked me if I wanted life insurance, they just tried to trick me into buying it.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the credit union wrote back, they sent a link to a new version of the forms.
		I still had to sign the life insurance form, but this time, the box meaning that no one was signing up for insurance was checked.
		Though I have to wonder: why did I need to fill out that form at all if I&apos;m not signing up for the life insurance?
		It feels really hokey, and I&apos;m hoping I understood the form well enough and I actually succeeded in not signing up for anything.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="IRA">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		It looks like just as before, this <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> is opt-out, not opt in.
		I <strong>*want*</strong> the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr>, and I <strong>*still*</strong> think making them opt-out is a load of garbage.
		People shouldn&apos;t have their pay cheques siphoned away from unless they specifically agree to it by opting in.
		Last week, I thought I saw something about my employer matching contributions too, but that was wrong.
		Predictably, they opted not to do that.
	</p>
	<p>
		There&apos;s a huge amount of paperwork I need to read for this <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> plan.
		It might take me a few days.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="modem">
	<h2>Internet modem</h2>
	<p>
		While thinking of ways to fit exercise into my schedule, I briefly considered finding some excuse each week to bike to Eugene on Wednesdays.
		My excuse for this week would be looking for a modem at the recycling centre.
		This plan won&apos;t actually work out though, so I won&apos;t actually be biking to Eugene every Wednesday.
		I could make it work when school is out, but when school&apos;s in session, I don&apos;t often have that time to spare, especially now that I&apos;m trying to socialise a bit more by biking to Eugene for <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meetings.
		Two trips to Eugene each week on top of school is just too much.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think I will make the trip this week though.
		I do need that modem if I&apos;m going to get a home Internet connection set up.
