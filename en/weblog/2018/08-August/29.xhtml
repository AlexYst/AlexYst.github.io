	<h2>Internet modem</h2>
	<p>
		I checked at the recycling centre, and much to my disappointment, they don&apos;t sell modems there.
		Perhaps there&apos;s not enough demand for them with the local <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> trying to get customers to rent modems instead.
		Or perhaps it&apos;s too difficult to refurbish them.
		What ever the case, that trip was a bust.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I tried at a big box store.
		I didn&apos;t plan to buy there, but I figured I&apos;d be able to find the low-end price there, then shop around until I found something close.
		The cheapest modem there was $90 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>!
		At this point, I figured I&apos;d have to suck it up at some point and pay this high price, or something higher after seeing what my other options were.
		I wasn&apos;t sure if I&apos;d set up an Internet connection any time soon though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried one more place today, not expecting a good price.
		Their price was only $50 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> though.
		This might be the modem I go with.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;d like to check around Gateway Street tomorrow though first.
		If I recall, there&apos;s an electronics store on that road, so I might get an even better deal.
		I&apos;m too tired to go look for it today though after three other bike trips, one being to the next city over.
		I could try shopping online of course, but shopping in person is an excuse to bike around, attempting to get in shape.
		I&apos;ll wait to purchase the modem until I&apos;ve spoken with the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> though.
		Depending on their policies and attitude, I might not get an Internet connection at all.
		Still, they&apos;ve got a policy I want to experiment with and I can only do that after I&apos;ve used their service for a while, so I might be mire forgiving than I realistically should be.
	</p>

<section id="health">
	<h2>health</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t eat much today, compared to how much I normally eat.
		The beat part is that I was legitimately not hungry, which is why I wasn&apos;t eating.
		I wasn&apos;t trying to deprive myself of food to help with my weight loss or something.
		Since I&apos;m not hungry, I can only assume I&apos;m doing just fine and the smaller diet shouldn&apos;t have negative repercussions.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess the real question is: why am I not hungry?
		Is the added protein in my diet keeping me from wanting food as quickly?
		It could be that I was craving food because I was short on protein.
		Maybe I was just taking in everything but protein so quickly that by the time I had enough protein, I had too much of everything else and gained a bunch of weight.
		Or maybe exercise is making me less hungry.
		That&apos;d be ironic.
		I&apos;m burning off more calories, so it would seem like my body would feel like replacing those calories.
		But maybe not.
		Or maybe I&apos;m just having an odd day.
		I don&apos;t really feel much like eating today, but maybe I&apos;ll be a glutton again tomorrow and actually have to put in some effort to avoid overeating by too much.
