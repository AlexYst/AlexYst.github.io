<section id="health">
	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>
		I seem to have slept about nine hours last night.
		All the biking around yesterday probably left me more tired than I&apos;d realised.
		That&apos;s probably a good thing.
		My legs and lungs are having to work more than usual, which should help me burn off calories.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of calories, I wasn&apos;t hungry this morning either.
		I ended up eating breakfast anyway, but only because eating breakfast supposedly raises one&apos;s metabolism for the rest of the day.
		Not eating right after waking, on the other hand, supposedly causes one&apos;s body to try to conserve fuel, as it thinks there might not be fuel available to expend.
	</p>

<section id="modem">
	<h2>Internet modem</h2>
	<p>
		One the way to the electronics store, I stopped at another department store I happened to pass by.
		Their modems cost over a hundred dollars though.
		And when I got to the electronics store, that place was selling their lowest-cost modems for sixty dollars.
		I&apos;m probably not going to find a more cost-effective one that the fifty-dollar modem from yesterday.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="exploration">
	<h2>Exploratory expedition</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve got an exploratory expedition I&apos;d like to go out on tomorrow.
		I would have gone out today, but I was worried about wearing myself out before the meeting tonight.
		I know I need to push myself if I&apos;m really going to shed some kilograms, but I already have to make the trip home from the meeting after dark.
		I don&apos;t want to be slowed down by fatigue.
		It&apos;s already makes me a bit nervous being unable to see much around me, so I like to make the return commute as quickly as possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s a good thing I didn&apos;t make the trip today, too.
		The trip to the electronics store was a bit far, and it wore me down enough that I was slower on my way to the meeting, and I ended up late.
		Next time I make a long trip before the meeting, I&apos;ll head to the meeting early.
