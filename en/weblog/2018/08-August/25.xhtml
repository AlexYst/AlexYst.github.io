	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>
		I got most of my major goal outlined, but ended up launching into an impromptu debugging session to deal with errors in the goal-formatting code I wrote last Thursday, so I didn&apos;t quite finish.
		I think I know the general direction I need to go now though.
		Tomorrow, I need to add the lesser goals, then I&apos;ll probably go over my plan in more detail.
		For now, I think it&apos;ll suffice to say that I think I should aim for only two or three goals at a time to not overload myself, and my current priorities should probably be weight loss, typing improvement, and coursework.
		Other tasks such as the job hunt should mostly be put on hold, though I might work on some lesser goals such as Palette Game development both in the process of working on the main goals (development requires typing, so it&apos;s a way to practice) and while taking a break from working on the main goals.

	<h2>Dental work</h2>
	<p>
		The main period of concern as far as a popped clot goes was the first for days.
		Tomorrow morning will mark the ninety-six hour mark and I don&apos;t plan to be doing any strenuous exercise in my sleep tonight, so it looks like I&apos;m in the clear.
		Complications at this point are unlikely.
		My gums feel like they&apos;re healing over alright too.
		I can still feel the hole with my tongue, but it&apos;s partly covered now.
