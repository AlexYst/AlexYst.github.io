	<h2>Prize</h2>
	<p>
		I received a flier in the mail telling me I&apos;d won a $250 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> shopping spree, but that I needed to visit a car dealership in downtown Eugene to claim it.
		Not sure what I&apos;d be allowed to buy, I couldn&apos;t ignore the offer.
		I mean, if I could buy groceries, for example, that&apos;d be money saved, even if the groceries were overpriced at the location the spree would be available for.
		So much for getting nearly a day and a half of rest.
		A single day will have to due.
		At least the pain in my jaw has gone down to the point of mere mild annoyance.
		It doesn&apos;t even feel like pain any more unless I touch it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once at the location, a dealer immediately started trying to sell me a car, before I could even open the door.
		I expected them to try to sell, but I also thought I&apos;d be the one starting the conversation.
		Anyway, when they asked what kind of car I currently drive, I dumbfounded them with my answer.
		I explained how the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> refuses to so much as issue people without telephone service a drive test, so as a result, even though I know how to drive, they won&apos;t issue me a license, leaving me unable to own or operate a car.
		They asked what kind of car I was thinking my next car would be, and I replied that since the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> was refusing to issue me a drive test and license, I had no chance of getting a car.
		Again, they didn&apos;t really understand how to deal with the situation.
		They needed to sell me a car, but as they understood I had no way to legally operate one, they knew they stood no chance of pulling off the sale.
	</p>
	<p>
		So they gave me the promised shopping spree voucher.
		I mean, first they went through the motions of pretending I might have won a better prize as I&apos;m sure they&apos;re trained to do, but then they handed over the voucher.
		It turns out it&apos;s for some strange online mall, so I made three assumptions.
		First, I&apos;d be unable to pay shipping from the voucher.
		This wasn&apos;t really a gratis shopping spree, but just a highly discounted one.
		Second, groceries wouldn&apos;t be an option.
		And third, the website would maliciously discriminate against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users, so I actually had won an unusable prize.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first two assumptions were spot on.
		The third doesn&apos;t appear to be.
		The selection available is terrible, and several of the supposed merchandise categories are empty.
		Much of the available junk is just racecar fan collectables, United States flag gear, and Christmas garbage.
		Needless to say, there&apos;s not much here I&apos;d want even if the items <strong>*were*</strong> truly gratis.
		Had the winning flier had more information, I wouldn&apos;t have wasted my time on this.
	</p>

<section id="goals">
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>
		I spent my time today at the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting building the code that&apos;ll keep my goal list organised and easily navigable.
		I didn&apos;t have time to write up the goals themselves, but now when I do, the goals will be formatted correctly to begin with.
		I won&apos;t need to reformat them to be compatible with the display code.
		I probably won&apos;t write up the goals tomorrow either, as I have and errand I want to run.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		It occurred to me on the way home that the pull request I wanted to draft might not even apply to the most basic of the instances I planned to use it: minerals.
		I&apos;d forgotten that I&apos;d wanted to use a separate texture for lump-type minerals and gem-type minerals.
		With the dropper nodes being too different between mineral types, I can&apos;t merge the nodes.
		Without a place in Pallete Game, I might keep things simple and try not to use the feature at all.
		And without a real use case, there&apos;s not much point in writing the code.
