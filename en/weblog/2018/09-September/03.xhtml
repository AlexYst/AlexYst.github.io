	<h2>Replacing mother&apos;s computer</h2>
	<p>
		I headed over to my mother&apos;s place so we could go look for her a computer as planned, but she decided that because it was a holiday today, they were probably closed.
		I wasn&apos;t able to leave to go deal with other business though.
		She kept me there, standing for several hours until my feet hurt.
		It wasn&apos;t that there weren&apos;t any chairs, though there certainly weren&apos;t any accessible.
		It was that her house is so full of junk that it&apos;s not even possible to sit on the floors.
		A little over half the space in every hallway is taken up by stuff.
		Several of the rooms are so full you can&apos;t even enter them.
		I think my own place is a mess much of the time, but it simply doesn&apos;t compare to her mess.
		My bedroom and entryway could use some more organisation, but without exception, I can easily walk through any part of my home meant to be walked through (as in, not a linen closet or something).
		At her place, I can&apos;t help but bump into things on both sides at the same time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every time it looked like I&apos;d be able to leave, something else would come up.
		Finally, it looked like she wasn&apos;t going to keep me longer, but we said our goodbyes <strong>*three times*</strong> before she stopped yammering and let me go.
		Even then, she only let me go after she&apos;d said to have fun on my bike ride for the day, and I said it wouldn&apos;t be such a fun trip if I didn&apos;t have time to do it before work and ended up having to bike in the dark tonight instead.
		At that point, she rushed me out of there.
		In other words, she wasn&apos;t much concerned with dallying and taking all my time for the day if it resulted in my not having tome to bike, but if it instead resulted in my going out late at night, she cared.
		She&apos;s concerned with safety, but not with my being able to meet my goals, such as sexercise goals.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t have time though for the ride before work, which was really frustrating.
		I got nothing done over at her place, but wasn&apos;t free to get stuff done elsewhere.
		I didn&apos;t actually go biking after dark though.
		I hadn&apos;t meant that I was going out today be it dark or light, I just meant that for there to be any ride at all, it&apos;d have to be after dark if she&apos;d taken too much if my time for the day.
		And she had.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since she didn&apos;t even want to try the recycling centre today, I agreed to give up part of Wednesday to go, even though I really don&apos;t want to give up any of my final day before school starts back up.
		(School will start at 22:00 that day, so it&apos;s not a full day off.)
		I&apos;ve been working hard, and I really wanted that day as a day of rest.
		I don&apos;t blame her though.
		And not wanting to drive over there just in case seems out of character for her.
		If they are honestly closed though, it&apos;s better for the environment that she not waste her fossil fuels going over there.
		So I&apos;ll give up the beginning of my Wednesday.
		I&apos;ll get up early, potentially not getting enough rest, then we&apos;ll head over there.
		She wants us to leave her place at 08:45, but seeing as I work the night shift and frequently have things that need to be done after work, there&apos;s a good chance I won&apos;t be in bed as soon as I&apos;d like.
		I&apos;m not staying after we get the job done though.
		I want to take a nice, long, relaxing, scented bath before I have to get back into coursework.

	<h2>Beer and smokes</h2>
	<p>
		I had an odd group come through the drive-through today.
		First, they offered me a beer.
		They pushed until I explained that I don&apos;t drink, then they offered me smokes.
		After telling them I don&apos;t smoke either, they asked if it was because of my religion.
		When I told them I&apos;m atheist, they said that since I&apos;m going to hell anyway, I might as well live it up.
		They were kind of mixing up logic there.
		Being atheist, they might think I&apos;m going to hell, but I don&apos;t believe in hell, so living it up because I&apos;m &quot;going there anyway&quot; wouldn&apos;t be a logical choice for me.
		Now if they&apos;d said that I might as well live it up because I&apos;m not worried about hell or not worried about making it to heaven ... that would have made a lot more sense.
		Then again, those people were smokers.
		I don&apos;t expect people whose idea of a good time is inhaling noxious fumes to be the type prone to making sense or having bouts of intelligence.
		Likewise, alcohol is a way to partly shut your brain off.
		People of even moderate intelligence don&apos;t drive around with a bunch of cans of the stuff in their car.
		If they use the stuff at all, they use it in moderation.

	<h2>Long way home</h2>
	<p>
		One of my coworkers had planned to telephone their parents for a ride home after work.
		Their mobile battery died though, and we&apos;d just closed the store for the night.
		They couldn&apos;t get in and use the company telephone.
		They berated themself for not charging their device while they were working, and headed to the bus stop.
		Honestly, I don&apos;t know why, but I followed them.
		I planned to leave them once they reached the bus stop; they could wait for the bus alone.
		Once there though, they saw the digital display, and saw no buses were coming.
		They blamed the holiday, but after checking the bus schedule, it turned out the holiday wasn&apos;t to blame.
		The late night buses don&apos;t come on Sunday.
		We weren&apos;t sure whether the earlier buses had come today, but either way, the bus was out of the question.
	</p>
	<p>
		They didn&apos;t want to walk home, but had no way to summon a ride.
		They didn&apos;t want to walk home.
		They explained about where their home is for sympathy, but that was well within walking range.
		The trip would be a bit long, but easily doable.
		Pansy.
		They tried to figure out what stores might be open at which an electrical outlet might be found, but all open businesses were further than they wanted to walk.
		Eventually, I came up with a plan: we&apos;d go to my place.
		It would be a half-hour walk, but that was quicker and easier than their other options.
		Once there, we&apos;d have an electrical outlet, they&apos;d use it to charge the device, and they could summon their ride.
		They agreed to the plan, and we headed off.
	</p>
	<p>
		We were about a block from my place, and they decided they&apos;d rather go to their friend&apos;s place instead.
		No explanation was given, but it was supposedly &quot;just around the corner&quot;.
		Their friend apparently also works a night shift and wouldn&apos;t be home until soon, so they certain;y wouldn&apos;t be asleep yet.
		I came with because they felt safer with someone accompanying them.
		Two people in a pair are less likely to get attacked, and if attacked, able to put up more of a fight.
		So we changed our course.
		It wasn&apos;t just around the corner though.
		It was around several corners, and down many blocks.
		Why were we taking such a long route when we had access to an electrical outlet at a closer destination?
		Finally, when we had nearly arrived, they explained their logic: they didn&apos;t want to wake their parents.
		It took too long to get to my place on foot, so their parents might be asleep by now.
	</p>
	<p>
		After making sure their friend was indeed home, I high-tailed it out of there on my bike.
		I found that with all the twists and turns we&apos;d made, we were actually much closer to our workplace than my apartment.
		I started making my way back to the main road, but found a familiar street name along the way and followed that street back to somewhere in my neighbourhood.
		By the time I got home, it was 00:12.
