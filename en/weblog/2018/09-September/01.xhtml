	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m tired today.
		The hours-long bike rides are wearing me down.
		So I really didn&apos;t want to go out on the exploratory trip planned for today.
		I forced myself to go though.
		I know if I don&apos;t force myself to exercise even when it&apos;s tough, I&apos;m going to stay fat.
	</p>
	<p>
		The path I planned to explore turned out not to be nearly as long as I expected.
		It took not much longer than five minutes to go down the path and back, I&apos;m sure, though even getting to the path in the first place added to my biking time.
		I was probably out only about forty-five minutes though.
		That was a relief.
		I got to rest more than planned today, but I didn&apos;t need to back out of taking the trip to do it.

	<h2>Mother&apos;s virus issue</h2>
	<p>
		My mother thinks her Windows computer has a virus.
		She also seems to think I would have a way to remove it.
		Without installing Linux, thereby eliminating both Windows and the virus together.
		I told her I&apos;d take a look, but also that it was unlikely I could fix any sort of Windows-related issue such as a virus without eliminating Windows.
		I mean, it goes without saying that the only correct solution to any and all Windows problems is to erase all Microsoft software from the machine.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m honestly not sure what to even do or where to start.
		Obviously, if I&apos;m going to stoop to trying to fix issues on a proprietary operating system, I at the very least need to use free tools to do it.
		Sources on the Web seem to recommend <a href="https://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a>, so I guess I&apos;ll start by attempting to install and run that.
		Maybe something will turn up the easy way.
		If not, I&apos;m not sure where to go from there.
