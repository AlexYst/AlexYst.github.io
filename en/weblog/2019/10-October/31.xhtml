	<h2>Pronouns</h2>
	<p>
		One of my workmates actually called me a &quot;they&quot; today.
		That&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve heard any of them be considerate enough to do that!
		There was another, who soon after corrected themself to call me a &quot;they&quot;, and one who corrected themself to call me an &quot;it&quot;, which showed they were trying on some level, but that one just popped out with it right off the bat.
		I bet they have no idea how much that meant to me, but it really brightened my day.
	</p>

	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Someone asked me to take on their shift for tomorrow.
		I was hoping to have tomorrow off, but I guess I don&apos;t really need that day, so I took the shift.
		I&apos;m out of work clothing though, as I was going to do laundry tomorrow.
		I jacked another work shirt, but I&apos;ll have to come in in jeans, as I&apos;m out of clean black pants.

	<h2>Honorifics</h2>
	<p>
		On my break at work, I formatted the letter to American Express that I&apos;d written yesterday, and prepared it for printing.
		After work, I headed home, found a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive, and copied over the letter to print at the library.
		I rushed to the library, but their printer was having technical difficulties, and it took time to resolve them.
		Once the letter had finally been printed, I rushed it to the post office, but I got there just after they closed and just as the final customer was leaving.
		Joy.
		So now I get to try again after work.

	<p>
		I wasn&apos;t sure if there&apos;d be a meeting today, but I was glad not to know.
		That way, I&apos;d get the exercise either way.
		There wasn&apos;t a meeting though, so I just headed right home after arriving.

<section id="Freya">
	<h2>Freya</h2>
	<p>
		Freya wrote to me tonight and gave me her girlfriend&apos;s email address, and also offering again to read the letter to Summer.
		She also said that her girlfriend might be getting her name changed this coming year to her preferred one she&apos;s already been using.
		She doesn&apos;t know that that got cancelled, as I just sort of dropped it and didn&apos;t tell anyone, aside from telling Vanessa yesterday because she brought that up as well.
		No doubt she was passing along the contact info because of my workmate that didn&apos;t listen to me.
		I replied, politely explaining about the mix-up, telling her the letter got cancelled and why, and offering my sympathies as to her girlfriend&apos;s hospitalisation.
		I do hope she&apos;s okay.
		And of course, I offered my congratulations about the name change.
		I know what it&apos;s like to be stuck with a name you hate.
