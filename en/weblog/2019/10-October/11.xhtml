	<h2>Productivity</h2>
	<p>
		I spend most of my free time today on household chores, including laundry (which I&apos;d normally do on Tuesday night, but instead worked on getting ready for swimming lessons in th emorning, which didn&apos;t pan out) and preparing Aztec salad.
		That salad takes hours to make, but lasts for a while, and seems to be something healthy to eat.
		I didn&apos;t actually make much progress toward anything today though.
		I did take a Minetest break though, and also worked on my memories project for a bit.
		I kind of got stuck once I reached a part I wasn&apos;t sure how to talk about.
		It&apos;s an important part of my history, but it&apos;s not the sort of thing you typically bring up in polite conversation.
		Eventually, I decided to just cut that part out of the page.
		It would give me value to get it off my chest, but it doesn&apos;t provide any value to readers.
		By the end of the day, I&apos;d finished that first page.
		Tomorrow, I&apos;ll probably begin the next.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/11.png" alt="A view of my pine farm, the bridge, and World&apos;s Navel from the untamed part of my isle" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I finished up the main bridge segment&apos;s trim, as well as the main tunnel at World&apos;s Navel.
		I still need to finish up the end cap bridges at World&apos;s Navel; small bridge segments allowing you to step out of the tunnel without falling, but not yet ready to lead anywhere.
		I also need to get the second World&apos;s Navel tunnel dug out and lined, and the small bridge segment connecting the two built.
		After that, I suppose I&apos;ll craft more torches and head back down into the cobble mine.
		I&apos;m not short on cobble or anything, but I could use some mese, if I can find any.
		Either that, or I could continue bridge-building without the mese and try to find new materials to work with.
		transport of what I find would certainly be quicker if I got the mese first though.

<section id="weight">
	<h2>Weight loss</h2>
	<p>
		One of our regular customers noticed today that I&apos;ve been losing weight.
		Nice.
		I need to press forward.
		Clearly, what I&apos;m doing is working, and I need to keep it up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Honestly, I wouldn&apos;t expect customers to care enough to pay attention to what I look like enough to notice when it changes.
		This customer was a physician though, judging by the uniform they were still wearing, so maybe they have a tendency to notice heath concerns even in people that aren&apos;t their patients, so they&apos;re seeing that health issue, my obesity, going away.
		I&apos;m probably not even technically obese any more.
		I&apos;m just fat, at this point.
		Im doing better.
