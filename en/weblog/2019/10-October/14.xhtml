<section id="Internet">
	<h2>Getting Internet service</h2>
	<p>
		I checked my email this morning to find a letter from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> claiming that my application is incomplete.
		The letter said if I didn&apos;t want to give them my Social Security number, or didn&apos;t even have one, I needed to upload a copy of my photo <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		I already gave them my Social Security number though.
		I didn&apos;t think that was optional for this tier of service.
		Had I know, I actually <strong>*would*</strong> have withheld it!
		The link the email contained brought me back to the page for uploading an eligibility-verification document, which I also already uploaded, and the page showed as still being on file.
		The page would not allow me to submit, but also had nothing left there for me to do.
		There was absolutely no option to do as the email had requested, and upload my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		Turning back to the email, it said not to reply to it, and to use a contact form on another site if I needed help.
		Following that other link, I found I&apos;m maliciously blocked from the other site.
		I&apos;m simply not allowed to get help except in person, which is about a half-hour bike ride away, and an additional half-hour back.
		This is just asinine.
		The email did say I could show my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> in person though, so off I went, frustrated that I might not have time after that for the one errand I&apos;d actually planned to complete today.
	</p>
	<p>
		I expected trouble at the in-person store.
		Last time, they refused to help me register for this service, saying I absolutely <strong>*had*</strong> to do it through the website.
		But the website&apos;s now not letting me.
		So in addition to my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, I brought the initial offer letter, my laptop with the email; broken registration page; and broken contact page loaded, and my eligibility document that I&apos;d already photographed and uploaded.
		When it was my turn to speak with a representative, I showed them both the email and the broken registration form, bouncing back and forth between the two while explaining the issue, as well as the broken support form.
		I still expected resistance, but as I had absolutely no one else I could contact with that contact form blocking me, they would have to - at the very least - put me in touch with <strong>*someone*</strong> that could deal with the problem.
		Especially considering that the email claimed that they, the in-person representatives, could deal with this.
		Much to my surprise, they admitted that they could take <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> on their end.
		That probably had nothing to do with my bringing everything in to cover my bases, but that certainly didn&apos;t hurt.
	</p>
	<p>
		They couldn&apos;t help me on their terminal, so we waited for the other representative to finish helping their customer so we could use their terminal instead.
		Then, the representative asked me for my telephone number so they could look up the account.
		My heart fell.
		Things had gone unexpectedly smoothly up to this point, but this was where we were going to start having issues.
		Sure, I could give them the bogus number I&apos;d put on the account.
		But that&apos;d be the incorrect way to handle the situation.
		The correct way would be to admit I have no telephone service, continuing to expose people to the idea that not everyone has telephone service ans that to assume everyone does is incorrect.
		So that&apos;s what I did: I simply said that I don&apos;t have telephone service.
		I expected the representative to say they couldn&apos;t help me.
		Instead, they asked me for my home address, and they looked the account up that way.
		It seems that often, there&apos;s multiple ways companies provide for their employees to look you up, but employees seem to always default to using the telephone number option.
		This is by far not the only time I&apos;ve seen this.
		Perhaps companies make the telephone number option way the easiest for employees to enter, or perhaps they instruct employees to default to telephone number.
		Who even knows.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, the representative says my account has been verified.
		Somehow, I&apos;m still expecting trouble.
		If there&apos;s no further issue though, I&apos;m still guessing that this little hiccup has reset my wait time.
		I probably have to wait three more days for approval.
		And honestly, I&apos;m hoping for just that.
		I haven&apos;t had hardly any time today to work on organisation, and I could use more time to get things straightened out before the tech arrives to install the modem.
	</p>

<section id="Summer">
	<h2>Summer</h2>
	<p>
		On the way out, I noticed that I couldn&apos;t see what the note I&apos;d left Summer said from across the room.
		I thought the sheen of the plastic page protector I&apos;d put it in was completely obscuring the text.
		How bizarre.
		Would my note even be noticed by Summer on her way out?
		I took a closer look to see if it&apos;d at least be reasonably visible up close, but found the note missing entirely.
		I&apos;d put it up, right?
		I checked my weblog photo, and sure enough, the note was in the photo, and the photo clearly showed part of my door.
		I&apos;d put it up before taking the photo; I hadn&apos;t messed up and hung an empty page protector without noticing somehow.
		She took the note.
		She saw the note, and took it.
		By doing so, she was acknowledging the note.
		Last time I left a note for her, she left the note in place until I finally took it down, a month or so later, even after talking to me in-person about the note&apos;s contents.
		She didn&apos;t like this note; I addressed her by name, and that didn&apos;t sit well with her.
		Either she didn&apos;t want to have to keep looking at it or she wanted to show someone else to complain.
		Either way, I&apos;ve struck a blow on some level, which was specifically a part of my goal.
		The other part, of course, was getting her to stop leaving my door unlocked and my home exposed to the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		How long has that note been gone?
		It had to have been gone when I got home from work yesterday.
		Was it there when I left for work though?
		Or had it disappeared the night before?
		I guess it doesn&apos;t matter much though.
		I only put it up a couple days ago, so there are only two nights she could have come and seen it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Knowing she&apos;d seen and had been bothered by the note lightened my spirits a bit.
		Despite the other stressors in my life at the moment, I&apos;ve made two recent signs to her that we&apos;re not on good terms.
		The other being that I missed her birthday, which is something I never do.
		I could tell her directly, but she&apos;s avoiding me, and I don&apos;t feel like initiating contact with someone I don&apos;t even want to see.
		I don&apos;t particularly need to rub it in her face or anything, but I don&apos;t want her somehow thinking things are getting better with time while she continues to avoid me.
		She&apos;s the type to think that problems she causes magically clear up on their own, even though she doesn&apos;t consider problems other people cause to clear up until they actively clear them up.
		She&apos;s always thought she&apos;s an exception to a lot of rules that she really isn&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		Overall, having known Summer had gotten my note, I felt better.
		I think this will really help me move on.
		But I found myself preparing in my head for a confrontation with her.
		There was a small chance she&apos;d drop by my workplace tonight to try to talk to me.
		The chances were slim, but I found myself growing angrier and angrier with her.
		As long as I had some to talk to - that is, to distract me - I was fine.
		But I&apos;m a good worker, so I tend to be stationed alone, because I can handle whatever I&apos;m doing without help.
		I actually prefer it that way, aside form the lack of discussion.
		That&apos;s the one downside.
		When I have a partner on landing, which is where I was stationed today, it&apos;s because someone has underestimated me and sent over help or because business is so slow that there&apos;s nothing else for them to do.
		Much of the time today, I worked alone.
		So on my breaks, I played some Minetest to take my mind off things.

<section id="honorifics">
	<h2>Honorifics</h2>
	<p>
		The errand I mentioned above that I&apos;d intended to take care of today was the letter to American Express.
		However, the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> issue didn&apos;t take as long to sort out as I&apos;d feared.
		Honestly, I thought the commute there would be nearly an hour alone, then that would be repeated on the way back.
		But it only took about half an hour each way, so I had time.
		I brought everything I needed, or so I thought, to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s place, so on my way back, if there was time, I could deal with the letter.
		I printed the letter (which included a colour scan of my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> at the local library off a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive I&apos;d brought, but when I went to address the envelope, I found I&apos;d failed to bring the envelope American Express had sent me.
		That meant I didn&apos;t have the return address, and had to head home for it, even though the post office is just a block or two from the library.
		Returning home, then heading back to the post office, I found the post office was closed.
		It seems it&apos;s a holiday.
		I didn&apos;t realise, as I pretty much ignore most holidays because I don&apos;t celebrate a single one of them.
		I&apos;m lucky the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s place and the local library were open, I suppose.
		The utility board&apos;s office wa open too, as I got my power bill paid along the way to the library.
		I&apos;ll have to try again tomorrow.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="photographs">
	<h2>Photographs</h2>
	<p>
		I checked my photograph I&apos;d taken on the way to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s place to get a good description of it for the <code>alt</code> text in my journal, once I&apos;d written up all of the above section.
		Much to my shock and frustration, I found the photo was the wrong size.
		It was huge.
		Not at all Web-ready.
		I&apos;d set my camera to take more-detailed photos yesterday so I could photograph my proof of eligibility with enough detail for it to be accepted, but I&apos;d forgotten to set it back.
		How sad.
		Today&apos;s photograph was beautiful; better than most of the garbage In include in my journal.
		It was a view looking down the bike path, under the colourful autumn trees, with the river beside it.
		I just can&apos;t include it though.
		It&apos;s too big.
		Yesterday&apos;s journal photo had to be removed as well, as it was taken after I&apos;d changed the resolution settings to use the larger size.
	</p>
	<p>
		I could, of course, edit the photos in the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr> to resize them.
		It&apos;s be a trivial matter.
		But I also archive the originals in this website&apos;s source code repository, and I don&apos;t want to archive the huge photographs.
		Instead, I just removed the <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> tag from yesterday&apos;s entry, and took a less-interesting photo on my way to work to replace the bike path photo.
		At first, I thought it a shame; most of my photos tend to be taken on the way to work, so it&apos;s gotten to be a rather boring set of views by now.
		I later photographed a nice wristwatch given to me by my doctor though, so today&apos;s photo turned out alright in the end.
		I was too excited to notice that the watch was upside-down as I photographed it, so that&apos;s that that&apos;s about.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="femininity">
	<h2>Femininity</h2>
	<p>
		One of my female workmates came up to me after some of morning crew had gone home, and said &quot;You and I are the only girls here.&quot;.
		Out loud, I replied that I&apos;m only half girl.
		In my head though, I was happy to be considered anything besides the man most of the world sees me as.
		They still refer to me as a &quot;he&quot;, so they don&apos;t actually think of me as a girl, but for a brief moment, they sort of acknowledge the fact that I&apos;m not a boy.
		That made me happy.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/14.png" alt="The ceiling of my current cave, with a few minables" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I got to work a bit early, so I played some Minetest; like yesterday, mostly just to say I had for the day.
		I&apos;m still in that cave, so I placed a few torches, mined a few ores, and shut the game off so I could get to work.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought that&apos;d be the end of my Minetest adventures for the day, but to take my mind off of Summer, I also played on my breaks, continuing to light up and clean out the cave.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="wristwatch">
	<h2>Wristwatch</h2>
	<p>
		On my second break, the person working the front counter came to the back room and told me I had a visitor.
		I immediately became apprehensive.
		That was likely either my doctor - the one who offered me a wristwatch - or Summer.
		I said that was likely one of two people, and asked what their hair colour was.
		I&apos;m sure they could tell by my face and my voice that I was apprehensive.
		Blonde.
		Sweet.
		That&apos;d be my doctor.
		They offered me a watch at my last appointment with them, and said they&apos;d drop it off at my workplace some time when I was in.
		They&apos;d emailed a few times asking what hours I worked on different days, though they hadn&apos;t showed before, and I&apos;d offered to swing by their workplace, though they didn&apos;t respond to that offer.
		They hadn&apos;t asked about today&apos;s hours, but I still had hope that it was them, and not Summer.
		And it was.
		Hearing it was my doctor brought me such relief.
		For the rest of the day, I was in considerably better spirits.
		It was like some part of me thought that I could only get one visitor today at most, so because my doctor had dropped by, I wouldn&apos;t possibly have to deal with Summer.
	</p>
	<p>
		The watch is a bit large, and a bit masculine, but it still looks rather nice.
		I wore it the rest of the work day, and I debated whether I wanted to wear it as an everyday thing or just when I&apos;m out and need to keep time.
		And during appointments with them, of course.
		I tried to wear it higher up on my arm that you&apos;d normally wear a watch, just because of the large wrist size it was built for, but it kept sliding down and the face would slip around to stupid-looking angles.
		By the end of the night though, I noticed four holes on either side of the band&apos;s clasp.
		One of which, the pin of the clasp was in.
		Adjustment holes?
		Probably.
		Sweet!
		I wrestled with the thing, trying to get the clasp to release the pin, but to no avail.
		I wondered if I needed to see a jeweller and have then resize it for me.
		I figured I&apos;d look up instructions if I could when I got home.
		There might be some trick to it, that if I knew, I could resize it myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I got the thing home, I started fiddling with it more, without even giving myself a chance to look up instructions.
		I had a flash of inspiration.
		What if the metal clasp wasn&apos;t supposed to move?
		I mean, it was clearly one solid piece.
		But I couldn&apos;t see the entire pin.
		What if the pin wasn&apos;t a tight in there as it looked, and I could slip it out one side?
		I took a thin wire that I honestly didn&apos;t think had the strength to move the pin, and tried applying pressure.
		I figured when the wire didn&apos;t work, I&apos;d go look for one of my pins.
		To my surprise though, the pin moved inward on the end I pressed, but didn&apos;t move outward on the other end.
		The thing&apos;s spring-loaded!
		That probably comes as no surprise to anyone that&apos;s owned a watch of any decent level of quality, but I&apos;ve never owned such a watch.
		My only real watch had been one with a band made of a thick, lanyard-type material.
		Before that, I might have owned one of those children&apos;s watches with the plastic bands.
		Never anything with an actual metal band though.
		This was new to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the band adjusted, I&apos;m definitely going to be wearing this thing everywhere.
		It looks nice.
		But also, I like what it represents.
		My doctor was incredibly generous to give this thing to me.
		And also, the type of person that carries a mobile doesn&apos;t need a wristwatch, because they&apos;ve always got the time on their device.
		Watches sort of fell mostly out of style as mobiles came into popularity, and wearing one, in a way, symbolises that I&apos;m not bound at the hip to such a device.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="management">
	<h2>Management</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager said that just once, I should close the store by myself.
		Y&apos;know, for the experience.
		Then they went home and left me to do just that.
		They left me with one last employee to help with the non-management parts of closing the store, and also to work one of the registers, as it&apos;d really suck if both the drive-through and the front counter were struck with customers simultaneously.
		I wasn&apos;t as fast at closing as I wanted to be.
		And that&apos;s entirely on me.
		I didn&apos;t utilise my greatest tool: delegation.
		I ran around and tried to do nearly everything.
		That&apos;s something I need to work on.
		Still, everything got done, and nothing went wrong.
		I didn&apos;t think it would though.
		Honestly, it was nice having the other new shift leader with me the first time we closed the store without the experienced managers.
		But I was confident today that I knew what I was doing.
