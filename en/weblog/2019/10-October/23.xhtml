<section id="ISP">
	<h2>The <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		The <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> continues to seem to think I&apos;m still trying to use their service.
		They sent me another email, this time about parental controls, and providing me yet another link to the login page that they refuse to actually let me use.
		I&apos;m too tired to follow up today, but I&apos;ll need to keep an eye on this to make sure it does actually go away properly.
		If it doesn&apos;t, I&apos;m going to need to head back to their store again.
	</p>

<section id="brownies">
	<h2>Brownies</h2>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I planned to make the new batch of brownies after work, and deliver then this morning.
		I&apos;d love to blame needing to clean the baking dish for this happening.
		The last batch burned onto the pan so badly that I needed to soak them off.
		But I&apos;m certain they didn&apos;t need to be soaked overnight.
		Just fifteen minutes might&apos;ve done the trick, and if not, an hour surely would have.
		But I was just so tired, so I didn&apos;t do it, and just got the brownies scraped out of the dish and got the dish started soaking.
		With the brownies not ready this morning, I couldn&apos;t deliver them, and there wasn&apos;t time to get them baked <strong>*and*</strong> delivered.
		I&apos;ve got tomorrow off, so I figured if I couldn&apos;t deliver them today anyway, there wasn&apos;t any point in baking them today.
		I might as well bake and deliver them tomorrow.
		Though not honestly my goal, this will also make them slightly fresher.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t at all use today productively though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="past">
	<h2>Someone from my past</h2>
	<p>
		While I was on break today, a customer came in and recognised me.
		They called me by my birth name.
		When that happens, I pretend I&apos;m not who they think I am.
		I prefer a fresh start, not to mention that with my poor memory, I don&apos;t usually recognise these people anyway, and it spares me the embarrassment of admitting I&apos;ve forgotten them.
		I mean, if they know me by my birth name, it means it&apos;s been years since I&apos;ve even seen them, not to mention that back then, I was in such deep depression that everything was a blur.
		So I did what I usually do, and told them I&apos;m actually Alex, not <span title="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>.
		They immediately and without hesitation said &quot;Oh, so you got a name change.&quot;.
		Most people don&apos;t catch on like that, especially because my appearance has changed these past few years.
		This past year alone, my face has gotten significantly thinner, and I&apos;ve worn my hair differently than how <span title="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> did for years now.
		It seems they may have had a leg up on other people though.
		They&apos;d changed their name too, meaning that they&apos;re more aware that names don&apos;t have to be permanent.
		Most people seem to take name permanence for granted.
		It seems they&apos;ve also had a child now, a child that shares my name.
	</p>

<section id="transitioning">
	<h2>Transitioning</h2>
	<p>
		The duct tape solution is becoming more and more comfortable as I get used to it.
		I&apos;m incredibly surprised, actually.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was thinking a lot about the facial hair-removal I&apos;m having done today too.
		I saw a couple black hairs, and my face is a bit fuzzy still, but it&apos;s not like I need to look like a girl.
		I just need to stop looking like a guy.
		I don&apos;t need every last hair gone, right?
		Maybe it&apos;s time to quit on the face, and start focusing on my back.
		Once I got home, I took a better look in the mirror though, and I have more black hairs left than I&apos;d realised.
		I&apos;m also not sure how long the lighter hairs are going to grow, but even just as they are, they don&apos;t look good.
		From across the room, you can&apos;t see them.
		Or at least, I can&apos;t in the mirror.
		But get fairly close, and I look pretty shaggy.
		I should keep going on the facial <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> work.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="sink">
	<h2>Leaky sink</h2>
	<p>
		It occurred to me at work today that I forgot to talk to the on-site apartment manager about the leaky sink when I payed my rent for next month!
		Drats.
		They entire point of putting that off was to get both done in one visit.
		Oh, well.
		I&apos;ll need to go bother the manager again then.
