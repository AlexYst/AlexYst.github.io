<section id="IRA">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t know why I thought the paperwork was supposed to be filled out by the new <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> custodian.
		That&apos;s not what the email the investment company sent me says, now that I reread it.
		I&apos;m supposed to fill it out myself, just like I planned to do anyway.
		The paperwork&apos;s a bit confusing though, so I think I&apos;m going to try to get help on it from the credit union&apos;s financial consultant after all.
		Anyway, I emailed the financial consultant explaining the situation and asking to set up an appointment.
		It shouldn&apos;t be too much longer before I can check this off my to-do list.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		It&apos;s Saturday, so it was time for another home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment.
		I swear I turned it up to the high setting, but when I finished, it was somehow on the low setting.
		I&apos;m not sure when during the treatment I bumped the spot on the touchscreen that changes the intensity.
		Hopefully, it wasn&apos;t early on.
		That was rather frustrating.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I made a mistake in some test code, and it erased most of my remaining pine needles.
		I was testing some code to allow items to be stacked above their normal limits, and found that if you shift-click them into another inventory, said stacks split into two stacks, with at most, the maximum stack size.
		That means that if the stack is over double the maximum, items get deleted.
		Furthermore, I didn&apos;t have a proper backup of my world.
		I had one from a couple days ago, but I got quite a bit done yesterday and today.
		I got rather frustrated about it.
		I don&apos;t want to reset that progress, but having the needles just missing would bother me as well.
		There&apos;s already needles missing because of the poorly-thought-out leaf decay code I only later discovered and fixed.
		I decided to make a break and start over.
		Again.
		This time, I need to make sure I make daily backups.
		No exceptions.
		Before I get started though, I want to mess with some more mod code.
		I want to find some use for <code>liblevelup</code>&apos;s levels, for starters.
		I&apos;m trying to raise my stats as high as I can, but for what?
		For now, it&apos;s all been pointless.
	</p>
	<p>
		I looked into mod channels as a method of conveying stats to players in <code>liblevelup</code>.
		It&apos;s something I&apos;ve really been meaning to do, but the feature seems under-documented and confusing.
		In particular, it looks like a diagram is supposed to convey the bulk of the information with on actual explanatory text for what the image even means.
		I figured out enough from the two documentation text files though (client <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> and server <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>), I think.
		In particular, it seems there&apos;s a method used to send a message to all clients subscribed to the channel, as well as the server, f that&apos;s subscribed.
		However, there&apos;s no option to send to one machine.
		That makes the feature useless for my purposes.
		What I need is a way for a single client to have a conversation with the server.
		This isn&apos;t what I&apos;m looking for, so I can stop worrying about the feature for the foreseeable future.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started toying with my potion idea again, but it has too many holes in it to actually be viable.
		I also thought about having plantable elements (seeds, saplings, and spores) make plants you&apos;ve planted of the respective types grow faster and tool material elements help you craft more-durable tools of their respective elements, but that leaves elements such as coral, which neither grows nor gets used as a tool material, without any level-up benefits, and that&apos;s no good.
	</p>

<section id="ISP">
	<h2>A letter form the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I received a letter from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> today, again telling me I need to verify my identity.
		This is the fourth time they&apos;ve asked me for that.
		My guess is that they sent this letter around the time of the first email, it just took that long to get here, but I verified my identity before the first email, when I was first trying to register, so there&apos;s no reason this letter should have been sent.
		More-interestingly though, this letter says I could send my documents via post or email, which the email never told me.
		I&apos;d be much less aggravated if I hadn&apos;t had to repeatedly take an hour out of my day to visit the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s in-person store.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that I have a contact email address, I might try setting up the devices.
		The people on the other end of that email address won&apos;t help though, so I might not even bother.
		Actually, y&apos;know what?
		On second thought, I still wouldn&apos;t be able to access my account because the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> is blocking me from their website.
		It&apos;d be more hassle to have the service than not have it, which is sad.
