	<h2>Lying <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I was told yesterday that if I didn&apos;t telephone in after my application was approved, my account would be automatically cancelled on me.
		No.
		That didn&apos;t happen.
		Instead, I checked my email as I was getting ready to head to the credit union, and found a letter telling me that not only had my application been approved, but they were sending me the self-install kit.
		No telephone call required.
		I mean, there&apos;s no Squid-damn reason a telephone call <strong>*should*</strong> be required, but the in-person representative I spoke with yesterday refused to cancel my application <strong>*because*</strong> such a telephone call would be required, and without it, my account would close on its own.
		So now, I was in a pickle.
		I had to head to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> to get this fixed right away.
		I mean, I&apos;d love to try the installation, and I&apos;d actually be happy not to need the tech to come install it.
		As I&apos;d mentioned before, I was frustrated that self-install wasn&apos;t an option.
		And now I&apos;m finding that it&apos;s the <strong>*only*</strong> option.
		That should be a good thing.
		But I&apos;m already fed-up with this <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> and I&apos;m not sure I even want to try their service at this point.
		And I figured that if I wait to contact them about this problem until I&apos;ve experimented with the install, they&apos;re going to find some way to hold me accountable for their rep&apos;s mistake.
		So off I rushed to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s store.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way, I realised something big: the self-install kit needs to be activated over the Web.
		Most likely, it needs to be activated on the website that&apos;s blocking me!
		I couldn&apos;t use the kit even if I <strong>*was*</strong> still up for putting up with the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s garbage.
		Getting this problem taken care of right away was definitely the right decision.
		When I explained the situation to the representative, including how I didn&apos;t think the self-install kit could be activated with the website blocking me, they didn&apos;t deny my concern.
		It&apos;s not an outright confirmation; and even if it was, the rep and I could have both had the same incorrect assumption; but it hints that I was probably right.
		Anyway, this rep agreed to cancel the service before it started, and said that it looked like the self-install kit might not have even shipped yet, based on what they could see in the system.
		We thought I might have gotten in in time that it won&apos;t arrive, so I wouldn&apos;t have to bother returning it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later that night, I received another email saying the self-install kit had been shipped.
		This time, a tracking number was enclosed.
		I&apos;m pretty sure the thing actually shipped, or there couldn&apos;t be a tracking number.
		So much for not catching it in time.
		The other rep really should have done as I&apos;d asked, and cancelled the application.
	</p>
	<p>
		This new email had a link to yet a fourth website, telling me to create my user <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		This site didn&apos;t block me.
		I was also given a link to video-based instructions on how to install the devices that came with the kit.
		First of all, the video was on one of the two sites that block me.
		I don&apos;t actually get any instructions at all.
		Secondly, why are there not text-based directions?
		I mean, I understand offering video-based instructions <strong>*in addition to*</strong> textual instructions, but not <strong>*in place of*</strong> them.
		A link to yet a fifth site was also included, this one seemingly-dedicated to support.
		This site blocks me as well, bringing the number of sites they expect me to use, but that don&apos;t actually let me use them, up to three.
		And it seems account-management is one one of the previous two websites that blocks me.
		There&apos;s no way this service is usable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, I&apos;ve done what I can to get the order cancelled.
		There&apos;s nothing I can do at this point, seeing as the rep from yesterday was uncooperative.
		I need to keep an eye on the tracking, and make sure I&apos;m home the day the package arrives, waiting in the entryway when the deliverer rings the bell (or knocks).
		(The postal service blocks me from their tracking website, but this was shipped instead through a private shipping company that seems to actually care more about their customers, so their tracking website works just fine.)
		I need to ask if there&apos;s a return-to-sender option, and explain the situation if needed.
		And even if there&apos;s no such option, if the package requires a signature to be delivered, I need to refuse to provide one, thus not taking on responsibility for the package.
		Most likely though, there&apos;s no option to straight-up return the package right then and there, nor would a signature likely be required.
		Still, it doesn&apos;t hurt to try, and I&apos;ll only get one chance to do this.
		I shouldn&apos;t waste that opportunity.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/18.png" alt="A marker made of pine needles, showing me which cave I need to die back into when it&apos;s time to go mining again" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve come up with a new idea for how to implement the <code>alchemy</code> mod.
		Or rather, the Alchemy modpack.
		The concept always had two rather-glaring issues.
		First, if I limited the alchemic recipes to two ingredients, there were a lot of holes in the palettes.
		That never sat right with me.
		Secondly, the number of combinations for non-alchemic recipes that use alchemic ingredients grows exponentially.
		If using only two-item alchemic recipes, these items also have unacceptable holes in their palettes.
		And if filling in the gaps in the alchemic items&apos; palettes using more alchemic recipes, the number of combinations of these items shoots far out of control.
		It&apos;s not at all manageable, and I can&apos;t possibly come up with the number of unique ideas I&apos;d need to to account for all the items&apos; forms.
		More importantly, such a huge number of nodes would have to be added to the game, that it&apos;d slow the game down, if the engine can even handle that many nodes.
	</p>
	<p>
		My new idea deals with both problems, at the cost of making the modpack exponentially less interesting.
		It&apos;ll still provide players with a huge number of options though, and provide quite a bit of value to the game, should I be able to pull it off.
		Anyway, the gist of it is that for each element, there will be exactly one base elemental item.
		That item can be crafted with other items, but it <strong>*cannot*</strong> be crafted with other elemental items that derive from a different base elemental item or have a different palette index.
		Each elemental item, both base and others, will have the usual 256 forms.
		These will be acquired by transmuting different sets of elements together.
		However, by not allowing multiple base mixes, the modpack will grow linearly with the number of elements and derivatives added to Mintest Game, not exponentially, bringing the project hopefully into the realm of feasibility.
		Also, each alchemic base item will have its own mod.
		Because the base items won&apos;t interact with one another, it provides clean lines at which to cut the mod, and provide modularity.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got to thinking as I rushed around all day though, and this is going to still require me to define 11520 wool variants, at a minimum.
		With the legacy dye system still in use, wool and dye are considered fifteen different items each.
		Cotton, coal, and blueberries are all able to be crafted into all colours of wool, and their version of each of the fifteen wool variants each has 256 palette indexes to fill.
		What a nightmare.
		Coming up with the 5888 bed variants (each of the eight tree/bush variants gets 256, while cotton, coal, and blueberries each get 1280) will be even worse, I&apos;m guessing.
		Even with the lesser number, beds will have more-complex capabilities than wool.
		I guess I could shrink that number by using group-based crafting.
		I might end up having to do that, realistically.

<section id="IRA">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		The first credit union I talked to offers <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr>s, so I didn&apos;t even talk to the other credit union or the bank.
		But if they still offer <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr>s, why did they transfer my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> to their then-partner company?
		Seriously, I had a certificate <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> (I think that&apos;s what it was called), and when it reached maturity, they had me transfer it to their partner to be held as some other type of <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr>.
		And now because they&apos;re no longer partnered to this company, I can&apos;t manage the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> through them, and because their former partner won&apos;t provide support for their broken website, I can&apos;t manage my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> through the former partner either.
		So now I&apos;m having to transfer it back.
		Today, they told me that their bankers don&apos;t have details about their <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> options, so I should make an appointment with their investment specialist via email, and sit down with them to discuss my situation and get recommendations.
		Then come in later to actually set up the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr>.
		As an afterthought, they said I could also make an appointment via telephone.
		It was <strong>*incredibly*</strong> refreshing for someone not to default to the telephone option though.
		I highly approve.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I need to find time to look into the paperwork the investment firm sent me links to.
		The investment firm made it sound like I should have my new investment firm - or in my case, the credit union, I guess - fill out this paperwork.
		I should probably read it over though, and fill out what I can of it.
		I&apos;m too tired to take a look at it today though.
	</p>

<section id="gift">
	<h2>A gift</h2>
	<p>
		I returned the wristwatch today.
		I really didn&apos;t want to.
		I made two trips to Eugene yesterday, and this would be my second trip today.
		Four trips there in two days is a lot; I was tired after just the first two!
		I wasn&apos;t sure my doctor would be in tomorrow (Saturday) though, with it being the weekend, I&apos;m fairly certain I remembered they&apos;re closed on Sundays, and I remember very clearly that they&apos;re not open on Mondays.
		If I didn&apos;t do it today, it was going to be quite a bit longer of a wait than it should be.
		So I headed over.
	</p>
	<p>
		There, my doctor first thought that I thought I had an appointment, but then saw my bag and thought I&apos;d brought them a gift.
		Wow.
		I hadn&apos;t brought <strong>*them*</strong> a gift.
		That made me feel like garbage.
		I can be such an inconsiderate person at times.
		I&apos;m under so much stress lately that I hadn&apos;t even <strong>*considered*</strong> getting them a gift.
		That&apos;s unacceptable.
		I need to find something nice for them.
		Nothing huge, obviously, because I&apos;m so poor I literally live in a ghetto.But some token of my appreciation is definitely called for.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="repair">
	<h2>Sink repair</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;d planned to talk to the on-site manager about my leaky sink again today.
		When I got up this morning though, I thought that maybe it&apos;d be a better idea to wait until next time I pay rent, which will be within a week, if I do it on my usual schedule.
		It&apos;s due the fifth of the month, but I tend to pay on the Tuesday after the twentieth of the prior month.
		At least, I do when I&apos;m not completely overwhelmed and disorganised.
		Why bother the on-site manager twice when I can roll both visits into one?
		After today&apos;s trips, I was just exhausted, so I went with that plan, and just put it off for now.
		Again.
	</p>

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		the company that sold me the home hair-removal <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> emailed me today, asking how the treatment was going.
		It&apos;d been eight weeks, and after eight weeks, most people see results.
		I&apos;m not seeing results though, so I said just as much.
		I didn&apos;t expect them to reply same-day, and I half expected them not to reply at all, as it seemed like sort of an automated email.
		They replied though, and said to keep going, saying that for some people, it takes as long as sixteen weeks.
		I guess I&apos;ll start over the treatment then.
		I&apos;ll go back to the two-treatments-per-week schedule for four weeks, then back to the one-treatment-per-week schedule again.
		That seems like the most-sensible way to extend the main treatment from eight weeks to sixteen weeks, given that I can&apos;t retroactively do two treatments per week these past four weeks.
		The alternative would be to have four weeks with the more-frequent schedule and twelve with the less-frequent schedule, and that doesn&apos;t seem correct.
