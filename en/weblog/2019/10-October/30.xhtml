	<h2>Vanessa&apos;s escape</h2>
	<p>
		I received an email from Vanessa this morning.
		That was quite a relief.
		I haven&apos;t heard from her in quite a while, and I was getting worried.
		I&apos;d tried emailing her, with no response, and I left her a birthday card early in the month saying I hoped she was okay, and that I&apos;d been trying to reach out to her.
		I thought Summer might be keeping her away from the Internet or had hijacked her email account.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turns out that yeah, turns out that yeah, Summer&apos;s been trying to keep her isolated.
		She&apos;s always been the type to do that.
		She kept us weak by keeping us alone, and she still does that with Vanessa, the only child she has left under her thumb.
		But Vanessa&apos;s moving out now.
		She plans to move in with our father on November 22.
		Our father&apos;s the type not to be trusted with secrets, but he doesn&apos;t tear you down emotionally, he doesn&apos;t try to assert dominance over you, and he doesn&apos;t try to keep you away from everyone else.
		Vanessa will be much safer and healthier there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Vanessa thought I might be angry with her for not reaching out sooner.
		I&apos;m just glad she&apos;s still okay for the most part though.
		And she&apos;s going to be doing a whole lot better soon.
		It wasn&apos;t safe for her to reach out before; I get that.
		And I never wanted her to risk herself or her well-being just to keep me in the loop.
		I&apos;m proud of her for getting out of there, and for doing what it takes to get by, even if that means remaining isolated for a while.
		It&apos;s sad that Summer has to be this way, and I feel for what Vanessa has been through, but this is all on Summer.
		Vanessa has done nothing wrong.

<section id="baking">
	<h2>Baking</h2>
	<p>
		I tried to bake the cookies today, but I burnt half the batch because I didn&apos;t know what I was doing.
		I might have baked cookies in home economics class in in middle school.
		I&apos;m pretty sure I did, actually.
		But I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve baked a single cookie since then.
		That&apos;s been quite a while.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was going to bring cookies for everyone at work tomorrow, but I don&apos;t have enough good ones and I don&apos;t have time to bake more.
		So I gave out cookies today, to the smaller crew working.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="quitting">
	<h2>Quitting workmate</h2>
	<p>
		I got more of the story on the first person to have quit; the one I hadn&apos;t witnessed.
		It seems their partner cheated on them.
		They were willing to try to work it out, as they loved them anyway, but they got an <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> in the middle of their shift from their partner, saying they were going to break it off.
		Apparently, this workmate was so devastated by the breakup that they said if they didn&apos;t have a child, they&apos;d&apos;ve killed themselves.
		Ouch.
		I can&apos;t be sure they meant it literally, but still, ouch.
		And that&apos;s certainly not a position I&apos;d want to be in.
		First, having a partner betray your trust, then they abandon you?
		I feel for them.
		They didn&apos;t take it well, and ended up quitting on the spot, though I&apos;m not sure to what end.
		If they&apos;re not going to commit suicide because they have a child, they&apos;re going to need money for food, utilities, and perhaps rent.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="ISP">
	<h2>Letter form the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I got a letter from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> today, which was no doubt in-route before I managed to get my account closed.
		They were offering me that computer deal.
		If I hadn&apos;t been as hasty, I could have gotten a replacement for this obnoxious Librem on the cheap.
		Maybe.
		I&apos;m not sure if they would have sold it to me before activating the account.
		But now, it&apos;s too late for that.
	</p>

<section id="honorifics">
	<h2>Honorifics</h2>
	<p>
		I recieved a letter from American Express today in response to my letter from them, telling me they couldn&apos;t accept my change-of-name request without a legal name change document and a filled out form, that they&apos;re also sending via post, but in a different envelope for some reason.
		I didn&apos;t ask them to change the name on the account.
		I asked them to stop addressing me as &quot;Mr.&quot;.
		I&apos;ve written a letter in response, which I hope to get sent out tomorrow, though I may not have time:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello American Express,
		</p>
		<p>
			I didn&apos;t ask you to change the name on my account.
			I asked you to stop addressing me as &quot;Mr.&quot;.
			&quot;Mr.&quot; is not and never has been apart of my name.
			I am &quot;Alex Yst&quot;, not &quot;Mr. Alex Yst&quot;.
			Or, if you absolutely have to use an honorific, call me &quot;Mx. Alex Yst&quot;.
			Again, I&apos;m not asking for the name to be changed on the account.
			I&apos;m asking you to stop calling me a &quot;Mr.&quot;, as I am not a man.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
			~ Alex Yst
