	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was being chased down by a rapist.
		I guess on some level, I realised it was a dream, so I exploited that for partial dreamworld powers.
		Despite that, they kept gaining on me, so I forced myself to wake up, again making me think I knew it was a dream on some level.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to sleep, and dreamed I&apos;d made it to the in-person store I bought the gaff from online.
		I was looking for more gaffs, hoping another might work better, but I couldn&apos;t find any.
		Oddly, though it&apos;s a store dedicated to selling items for trans people, there were several non-trans items there, which baffled me.
		For example, there was embroidery floss, though no cross stitch fabric.
		There were also tee-shirts with popular characters on them.
		The person I&apos;d emailed from the store was a woman, despite my thinking of them as a man when we were emailing.
		Their name&apos;s non-binary like mine though, so I don&apos;t really know for sure.
		In my defence, I didn&apos;t realise it was a non-binary name until I looked it up today, and thought it was a strictly-masculine name.
		I can&apos;t be familiar with all names, y&apos;know?
		It&apos;s odd I&apos;d dream about them as the opposite gender as I&apos;d pictured them as though.
		They stepped out for the day, but said to email them tomorrow if I needed to reach them.
		The other employee on-premises seemed eager for me to check out and leave though, so I finally said I was done when they asked.
		They rung something into the register before I could even get there, and I was curious as to what they thought I was buying, as I&apos;d found nothing of interest.
		I&apos;d made a mental note to get my embroidery floss here should I need more, but I wasn&apos;t getting any this time.
		I&apos;d bent down for something, but I was having trouble getting back up, much to my embarrassment.
		I figured it was because I&apos;m still too fat.
		I yelled my apologies about my slowness over to the register.
		Eventually, the person I&apos;d emailed came back as I was managing to get back to my feet, which surprised me because I thought they&apos;d left for the day.
		In retrospect, maybe they just told me to email them if I needed more help because they thought <strong>*I&apos;d*</strong> be gone by the time they got back, not because they were leaving for the day.
		I didn&apos;t make it to the register before I woke up, so I didn&apos;t get to learn what had been rung in.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m still fat, but I&apos;m nowhere <strong>*near*</strong> fat enough that I can&apos;t get back to my feet.
		Even when I fall on my back, assuming I don&apos;t get hurt, getting to my feet is no big deal.
		In fact, getting up was never a big deal for me.
		I&apos;ve <strong>*never*</strong> been that fat, though I&apos;ve been fat enough that bending down to tie my shoes used to physically squeeze the air out of my lungs, as my legs pressed my fat into my chest.
		I guess some part of me is still really down about the girth I still have remaining though.
		Also of note, my headache from yesterday was still intact the first time I woke up, but had gone away by the second time I awoke.
		I went back to bed again though, as it was still too early to be up.
	</p>
	<p>
		This time, I dreamed my bike had gotten stolen again, and I&apos;d gotten frustrated and panicky.
		Then for some reason, there was a scene change, and I was trying to catch a grasshopper with a colour and texture resembling dead pine needles.
		This colouring was reasonable,given that it was hopping around under some pines, and the ground was covered in dead needles.
		I haven&apos;t tried to catch grasshoppers in <strong>*years*</strong> though.
	</p>

<section id="IRA">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		Wow.
		Okay, so the investment company wrote back to me.
		They just sent me a form to transfer my money to another institution, and another to outright withdraw all my money via post.
		They refuse to provide support for continuing on with their company, but they provide absolutely no resistance to leaving.
		Honestly, I expected a bit of a fight, or them to at least try to keep me as a client.
		If they&apos;d really rather I leave then help me use their service, I&apos;m happy to go though.
		I need to find another investment company first though, and that&apos;s not happening today.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/10.png" alt="An incomplete branch in the tunnel" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I probably should have worked on gathering more snow for the bridge, but instead, I mostly set that aside and worked on the tunnel through World&apos;s Navel.
		I&apos;ve got plenty of cobble to line the tunnel, not to mention that I gather more as I dig out the spot for the tunnel.
		I&apos;ve also got plenty of logs for fuel to melt the cobble down for stone bricks and stone blocks.
		It seemed like a good time to take a break from tree-farming to do something else for a bit.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="prize">
	<h2>Prize</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the car dealership that tried to sell me a car, despite my being upfront with them from the get-go that I don&apos;t have a driver license, has sent me another flyer telling me I&apos;ve won a prize.
		At least, I think it&apos;s the same dealership; they&apos;re holding the event in the same mall&apos;s parking lot, in any case.
		I didn&apos;t really keep track of which dealership it was last time.
		Anyway, this time, the flyer said the small prize that everyone wins, that they try to make you think isn&apos;t the one you won, is wireless earbuds.
		I have no use for those, but I figured I could pick them up on the way to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting anyway.
		Even if I get a compatible Vorbis player at some point, which I&apos;d really like to do, I can&apos;t stand things in my ears, so earbuds are always unpleasant for me.
		One of the other <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> members might want them though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was antsy to get to the dealership, for some reason.
		I guess I thought I might show up late?
		Honestly though, they close at the same time the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting begins, according to the flyer, and the mall the dealership is set up at right now is along the way, so as long as I left on time to make it to the meeting, I&apos;d make it to the dealership while it was open.
		And if they held me up enough to make me late to the meeting, it didn&apos;t really matter.
		The main goal when I attend the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meetings is simply to make it there and back; that is, to bike 26 kilometres in total.
		I don&apos;t have to make it there on time, and usually when I do, I&apos;m the only one that does.
		Everyone else shows up late.
	</p>
	<p>
		I rationalised that the dealership had taken so much of my time last time, so I should get there earlier.
		But of course, that close to closing time, the employees aren&apos;t going to want to stay late just on the off chance they can get a sale out of someone admitting they have no driver license.
		They&apos;re more likely to take my time if I come earlier.
		The earlier I come too, the more energy and enthusiasm they&apos;ll no doubt have to try to use on me.
		Coming later would by far be the more-intelligent move, I used last time&apos;s experience as an excuse to go early anyway, and gave myself about an hour and a half to deal with the dealership.
		I couldn&apos;t help but think of the time I&apos;d waste if they didn&apos;t hold me up, and that was the only time one of these dealerships has pushed that hard, but I rationalised that I could bring my notes on my laptop; get dinner; and work on my pre-<code>y.st.</code> memories section of my journal, a project I&apos;ve been meaning to work on for quite some time.
		I have things from my past I think about sometimes that predate my journal, and it&apos;d be great to jot them down somewhere.
		That bit of rationalisation, unlike the other, was actually reasonable.
		If I stayed home, I&apos;d go pay the power bill, then probably play Minetest some more.
		I bring <a href="/en/domains/bailey.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a> to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meetings though, and my Minetest instance is on <a href="/en/domains/taylor.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a>.
		If I stopped to kill time on the way, I couldn&apos;t get distracted by Minetest, and would be a thousand times as likely to work on the memories project.
		And I haven&apos;t eaten out in a while.
		It&apos;d be a nice change of pace for the day.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the dealership, the salesperson acted like most vehicular salespeople, first asking why I had no license, then commenting that the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr>&apos;s policy is ridiculous.
		That was the end of it.
		No attempts to push a sale on someone that isn&apos;t legally allowed to use their product.
		They did try to get my hyped up that I might have won a prize bigger than the earbuds, but admitted that my statement that that was the prize I&apos;d won was the most-likely reality.
		And so it was.
		When we checked the drawing board, I&apos;d won the earbuds.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="technology">
	<h2>Tech stuff</h2>
	<p>
		While I was at the mall anyway, with nothing pressing for about an hour and a half, I decided to take a look around before getting food.
		I mean, I could have gotten started on my memories project right away, but I was already planning to spend my <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> time on that, so there was no reason I had to jump right on that.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first thing that caught my eye was a sign saying this mobile repair stand would make any device repair for at least ten dollars less than any other repair stand in the mall.
		Only the ones in the mall?
		Why are there multiple repair stands in the mall?
		But that wasn&apos;t what I found interesting at the time.
		Rather, it was that I&apos;d run across a repair stand at all.
		The salesperson caught me looking, and asked what I was packing.
		I keep my GT-i9100, with the battery removed, in my purse, so I told them about the problems with it.
		It took them a bit to figure out what it is, because it&apos;s not a device sold in this country (or a device even still in production), but once they knew what it was, they gave me some information.
		First, the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> port can be replaced.
		That&apos;ll cost me $44.95 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		It&apos;ll cost me $44.95 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> for a chance at <strong>*maybe*</strong> being able to save two or three days worth of photographs.
		I&apos;m not likely to pay that, but it&apos;s an option.
		Next, the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card issue isn&apos;t fixable.
		They think (without doing any checks or tests) that it&apos;s a hardware issue related to the motherboard.
		It very well might be.
		I think there&apos;s a chance it&apos;s related to the partitioning issue, but it could be that that issue is somehow <strong>*also*</strong> tied to the motherboard, and the shot motherboard is causing both symptoms.
		I nearly forgot to ask about the radio, but when I did, they said that was also a motherboard issue and unfixable.
		So there very well might be three motherboard issues.
		It&apos;s probably not getting fixed.
		Ever.
		The only way to fix it would be to do it myself, most likely, and I wouldn&apos;t even know where to begin with that.
		It&apos;s theoretically possible that I could get another GT-i9100 and use it for parts, but it was so hard to even get the first, and if I get a working mobile between the two, I&apos;m still stuck with a device that doesn&apos;t have basic functionalities such as Wi-Fi due to the manufacturer not releasing the specification s needed to build proper free software support for the device&apos;s full hardware.
		It&apos;s just not worth even trying, to be honest.
		Because the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> port is supposedly replaceable, I guess I might try to replace the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> port myself.
		Maybe.
		But probably not.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also stopped by the Apple store.
		I was never going to buy anything there, but I thought I could fulfil an idle curiosity without a Web search.
		I said I was in the market for a music player, and asked them if iPods can play Vorbis files.
		The salesperson didn&apos;t even know what a Vorbis file is, and said they think iPods only play <abbr title="MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> files.
		Their associate, standing next to them, also didn&apos;t know what Vorbis files are.
		I guess it&apos;s not a common question they get asked.
		I didn&apos;t care enough to do a Web search once I got to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting and had Internet access though, because I&apos;m not getting an iPod anyway.
		Had I gotten a confirmation that iPods can play Vorbis files, my next question would have been whether iPods are <abbr title="Media Transfer Protocol">MTP</abbr>-compatible.
		They might be, but I think they mainly use a proprietary garbage protocol that requires untrustable software to be installed on your computer in order to transfer files back and forth, and screw that noise.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="memories">
	<h2>Memories</h2>
	<p>
		I got a reasonable amount of work done on the memories project today.
		My first goal was to pick a topic and separate all notes related to that topic out of my list, into a new list.
		I found so much interconnected stuff, that I honestly don&apos;t think this memories project is going to be as big as I&apos;d thought.
		I simply don&apos;t remember a lot.
		I inherited poor memory from both parents.
		Of course, that&apos;s all the more reason I should get this project done as soon as I can.
		The longer I wait, the more I&apos;ll forget.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I chose gender, sex, and sexuality as my starting topic.
		There are a few large topics, but most of the topics are either small or very negative, and this one was at least not so harsh against Summer.
		I mean, I touched on her issues with me on that page for sure, but many of my memories are specifically about her and her constant negativity.
		Come to think of it, I should combine those all into one page, or something.
		But back to the point, I feel more comfortable writing large pages than small ones, so I figured I&apos;d write about the big topics, maybe tying some of the smaller topics in along the way, then clean up the smaller topics at the end.
		The easiest two topics to start with would probably be the one I chose or the one about how I came to be a Debian user.
		That one&apos;s a bit of a longer story as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		I translated my short notes on the topic into actual sentences for paragraphs, but found my energy level quickly dropping.
		I&apos;m burnt out.
		I&apos;m just getting over a cold that lasted way too long.
		I wasn&apos;t feeling at all well yesterday, with a killer headache.
		And I think I&apos;m emotionally burnt out from a variety of things.
		And I woke up at least twice in the middle of the night, last night.
		I didn&apos;t get enough rest the night before, either.
		I decided I didn&apos;t even need to finish this page today.
		Getting started had been more than enough.
		Seeing what I was in for, I&apos;ve realised the project isn&apos;t as daunting as I&apos;d first thought, and it should be much easier to convince myself to put time toward this in the coming days.
		I feel like I had more energy once I made it to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, so I continued my efforts, but making conversation with the group did slow things down considerably.
		It always does, but I almost never account for that.
		I didn&apos;t finish the page, but I still made decent progress on it, if you count the part I wrote at the mall too.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="EUGLUG">
	<h2><abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting</h2>
	<p>
		At the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, someone was trying to buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-38_can_opener">P-38 can opener</a>, but failing.
		Apparently, theirs, which they&apos;d kept on their key ring for about forty-five years, got caught on a bus seat and yanked off without their having realised it&apos;d come loose from the key ring.
		They were trying trying to buy from two different online stores that block me, and they were getting blocked as well.
		Interesting.
		I&apos;d assumed these sites were maliciously targeting <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users, and that was the reason they were blocking me.
		But no.
		Maybe not.
		This other member isn&apos;t a <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> user, or at least didn&apos;t mention it when I said I was blocked form the same two sites and assumed it to be a <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> block.
		They offered twenty dollars to anyone that could buy them one online, showing me a page offering one for ten dollars on one of the sites blocking us.
		I found a five-pack on a third site for a little over six dollars, and that site isn&apos;t blocking me.
		I declined the money, as I was just doing it to be helpful.
		It looks like it won&apos;t arrive for two weeks, but if they can wait that long, it&apos;s theirs.
		I&apos;m not sure they want five, but it&apos;s better than zero, and if they thin of it, they don&apos;t have to take all five.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I&apos;d hoped, someone took the earbuds off me.
		Several of the other members thought they might a name-brand product, the it&apos;s not, and the person that took them didn&apos;t mind that.
