<section id="leak">
	<h2>Leaky sink</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve finally told the on-site manager about how the repairperson never showed up, and they said they&apos;d resubmit the work order.
		So hopefully that&apos;ll get fixed soon.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="surveys">
	<h2>Surveys</h2>
	<p>
		I got emails from two different companies asking me to rate their services.
		One was the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>, and the other was that company that company that cancelled my order on me without telling me.
		I didn&apos;t get a chance to tell off the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> because their survey ended before I could answer anything interesting, but I complained to the other company.
		They cancelled my order, then had the gall to send me a survey about my experience with the order.
		Seriously, much of the survey was specifically about that order, and they even included what the order was in the survey.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="locales">
	<h2>Locales</h2>
	<p>
		I found a setting in the <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> on the Librem, allowing the locale to be set without root access or silly command line commands a bit ago, but it didn&apos;t seem to work on Thunderbird&apos;s perceived locale.
		With all the things I tried on the command line to get it to display dates and times correctly (none of which worked), I figured I might have put it out of sync with this setting, so before I could write for help, I needed to restore the system to factory settings.
		I&apos;ve been trying to find time to do that.
		Today, I started downloading the system disk image to reinstall, but that took a lot longer than I&apos;d expected.
		I should have downloaded it long before I planned to use it, perhaps even downloading it overnight while I slept, when I first found the setting.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I had it downloaded, installation was pretty quick, but when I told the installer not to localise the installation, it set the system to use an Arabic locale.
		I was intending for it to use the C locale, and ended up having to reinstall to set it to English English instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, with the system reset to default values, I tried setting the locale in the <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> again, which predictably didn&apos;t work, then got the screenshots I needed and asked for help on the forum.
		I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll get a working solution there, with how ridiculous Mozilla software is these days, but at least I&apos;ve tried now.
		I&apos;ll probably need to switch to a new client.
		Honestly, I&apos;ve never liked Thunderbird anyway, and only used it because it&apos;s TorBirdy-compatible, and without TorBirdy, I hadn&apos;t previously been able to be sure my email client wasn&apos;t leaking <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> requests.
		Thunderbird kept disabling TorBirdy though, which for all I know allowed leaks at random times, and now I&apos;ve got <code>iptables</code> configured to block all links and I&apos;m not using TorBirdy anyway.
		If I find a client that actually gets through with <code>iptables</code> configured, I know it&apos;s not leaking.
		The solution is as easy as that: stop using Thunderbird and replace it with something that allows basic configuration.
