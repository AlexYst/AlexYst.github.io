	<h2>Honorific</h2>
	<p>
		I got that letter to American Express dropped off at the post office on the way to check the Tuesday drawing number.
		Somehow, I think there&apos;s a high probability that they won&apos;t respond.
		Still, getting that mailed out made me feel a lot better.
		Between getting the letter to American Express sent out and my note to Summer disappearing, I&apos;m feeling rather decent today.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/15.png" alt="A wall of water within the cave" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I finished cleaning out the main area of the cave I&apos;ve been working in.
		From there, I have three directions to go.
		One is a lower section of that same cave that&apos;s going to be sort of tricky to get down into safely.
		The other two are caves I dug a path to by clearing away silver sand or gravel that separated them from the cave I was in.
		These two are a pain to get into due to being above the ceiling of a tall part of the cave.
		I opted to travel down one of the ceiling paths first to get it out of the way.
		I&apos;ll probably follow the other one before going back to the lower section of the main cave.
	</p>
	<p>
		This new cave was long and winding, unlike the cavern-like cave I started in.
		It seemed to go on forever, and eventually branched out in three directions.
		If it keeps branching like this, I&apos;ll never clear it all out!
		I picked a path, and eventually, it led back to the fork.
		Sweet!
		I&apos;m glad I chose that route.
		I guess I had a two out of three chance to choose that path, so the odds were in my favour, but there was still a one in three chance I&apos;d&apos;ve picked the wrong path.
		I backtracked to gather my torches before moving on, then took the final branch.
		I didn&apos;t get far before I hit a wall of water.
		I&apos;d found the side of an underground lake, and it was spilling into the cave below.
		I debated back and forth whether I wanted to try to continue from there, or turn back and consider my work in the cave complete.
		In the end, I decided that water is too much of a pain to deal with.
		Pretty much my excuse for not mining away the entire seafloor is that not drowning would be such a pain down there.
		There&apos;s no reason that excuse doesn&apos;t apply to underground lakes, too.
		The main reason I&apos;m revisiting these caves along my mine shaft is to slow down the lengthening of the mine, so when I strike mese, I&apos;m not spending more of it on rails than I&apos;m taking in.
		I&apos;m eager to get down to where the mese actually is, but if I just speed through the area without cleaning out the caves once I get there, my mese consumption will be through the roof, while my mese intake will be through the floor.
	</p>
	<p>
		On my way out, I noticed that I&apos;d missed another branch; or rather, I&apos;d forgotten about it.
		Upon first reaching this cave, I found it goes in both directions, and I&apos;d had to choose one.
		Tomorrow, I&apos;ll deal with the other direction.
	</p>

<section id="organisation">
	<h2>Organisation</h2>
	<p>
		I got a good deal of the organising done, considering that I spent most of the day running errands and working my day job.
		At this point, I mainly need to figure out what to do with the items I have stashed on two of the tables in my bedroom.
		That&apos;s not going to happen tomorrow.
		I&apos;ve got to finish my website update, and I&apos;ve got a shift at work.
		Normally, I have Wednesdays off, but not this week.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="polish">
	<h2>Nail polish</h2>
	<p>
		The other new shift leader asked if I&apos;d gotten my nails done.
		It turned out they&apos;d never noticed that I wear nail polish every day.
		That was hilarious.
		I&apos;ve been wearing this colour for over a month now.
		It was also enlightening.
		We work together fairly often, and it simply didn&apos;t register.
		Strangers who only see me once probably don&apos;t notice it either.
		It&apos;s not giving me the feminine vibe I&apos;d like it to.
		I need to try something else.
		I mean, I know what I need most is to fix my voice, but I&apos;m still on the waiting list for that.
		There&apos;s got to be more that I can do without help.
		I&apos;ve already taken to dressing in exclusively-women&apos;s clothing when off the clock on most days, but there&apos;s a bit of a fuzzy line when it comes to fashion these days.
