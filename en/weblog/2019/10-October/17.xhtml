<section id="ISP">
	<h2>Dealing with the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t get to bed as early as planned, but I still got to sleep early enough to wake before my alarm, which was set to 08:00.
		That gave me an hour to get ready, and forty-five minutes to get to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s place.
		I&apos;d arrive early, and definitely not miss the appointment.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I checked in, the representative at the counter told me they&apos;d put me at the end of the waiting queue because I was early, then move me to the front once it was time for my appointment.
		I guess that&apos;s how they handle appointments here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another representative came to get me soon.
		I barely had time to set up my journal pages for the week and get a the first, three-sentence paragraph of this entry written.
		It wasn&apos;t a long wait at all.
		But then again, I had an appointment, so I wasn&apos;t expecting a long wait.
	</p>
	<p>
		I explained the situation to this new representative.
		They wanted me to upload the same eligibility document again, and I showed them that my initial upload my same eligibility document again.
		I showed them that the site showed my uploaded file as still present.
		So they told me to upload that same file as a second file, so there&apos;d be two of it.
		Um.
		Okay.
		I really didn&apos;t want to do that, but it wasn&apos;t like they were going to try anything else until I did, so I did as they asked.
		I thought it&apos;d take again, to be honest, but that I&apos;d get another error email later.
		Instead, the I got an unspecific &quot;something went wrong&quot; error message right away.
		That was a relief.
		Honestly though, it&apos;s probably because the page was loaded for a few days, and the poorly-programmed website made assumptions that don&apos;t apply under such circumstances.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, the representative said they were going to put me on a call with telephone support.
		How aggravating.
		I hate dealing with telephone calls.
		They placed the call, and I listened as they walked the robotic response tree.
		It was one of those particularly annoying ones, where you&apos;re not allowed to press buttons to get where you&apos;re trying to go, but instead must rely on speech-recognition software to figure out what you&apos;re saying.
		Twice, I hear them tell the robot my service tier.
		However, when they finally reached a live person, they&apos;d been connected to someone that doesn&apos;t deal with that tier, and had to ask them to transfer them to the people tat do.
		At that point, they put me on the line.
	</p>
	<p>
		The telephone representative told me they saw my identity had been verified, and they&apos;d have my application approved no earlier than tomorrow and no later than Monday.
		They asked if that was all I needed, so I asked about getting the Web support site fixed.
		I found they refused to actually answer any questions, kept telling me irrelevant facts, kept spouting the same information repeatedly.
		In particular, they would not tell me if people without a telephone line are even able to get support, and they kept telling me that I could check my application status - which I repeatedly told them wasn&apos;t my reason for trying to reach support - via the website that isn&apos;t blocking me.
		Finally, I said that this didn&apos;t seem to be going anywhere, and they hung up on me without a word.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I got off the call, they in-person representative told me that after verifying your <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> in-person, you always have to telephone the support people before your application can be approved.
		Showing your <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> and having that added to your account simply doesn&apos;t notify the people people in-charge of approving the accounts.
		What kind of garbage is that!?
		First of all, there&apos;s no Squid-damn reason for that.
		If that&apos;s honestly how their process works, it needs to be fixed.
		Second, I verified my identity online using my Social Security number already.
		From the <strong>*very beginning*</strong>, my identity was verified, and I simply redundantly verified it when I came in-person before.
		Third, if this is how it works for some idiotic reason, the representative that checked my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> sent me away without calling and without telling me to call, causing me two additional trips to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s store for no good reason.
		I was too angry about having to do this via telephone at all to think to bring this particularly-important point up with the representative until I&apos;d already left though.
		Fourth, getting my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> check triggered another email to me.
		Clearly, the people working on account-approval <strong>*did*</strong> get signalled.
		The representative stuck with their story that the account-approval people don&apos;t get notified, but admitted having no other explanation for the fresh email the day after I got my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> checked.
		Finally, the representative said that once approved, my service can&apos;t be started until I telephone in again after approval, so this <strong>*still*</strong> isn&apos;t even finished.
		If I decided to go along with this idiocy, I&apos;d have to bike in <strong>*again*</strong> and have them put me on the line <strong>*again*</strong> to actually get service.
	</p>
	<p>
		The in-person representative had seen how increasingly angry I&apos;d been getting as the telephone representative continued refusing to answer the same, simple, yes-or-no question repeatedly.
		They said the telephone representatives have to read from a script, and can&apos;t actually answer questions.
		So what good are they?
		The in-person representative called them a &quot;broken robot&quot;.
		I pointed out that that makes telephone support entirely useless, as you can&apos;t actually get support for issues, because most problems are going to be specific, and not able to be accounted for by the script.
		The in-person representative said they&apos;d be straight with me unlike the telephone person, and said that without a telephone, you can&apos;t get support - at all - with the low-tier service.
		And since telephone support at this company is entirely useless, you can&apos;t get real support at all.
		They also said the in-person store isn&apos;t about support, they&apos;re about sales, so they can&apos;t help you either - they can only put you on the telephone.
		Joy.
		That&apos;s completely obnoxious and completely unacceptable.
	</p>
	<p>
		They said upper-tier service additionally comes with Web support, which most people use.
		I showed them again that the website was blocking me.
		They claimed that to be the low-tier-specific support page, which made no sense seeing as they also said the low-tier service gets no web support, and said from the homepage, there&apos;s a support link.
		So I showed them that was blocking me too.
		The site&apos;s blocking me, not the specific page.
		They claimed it was my computer that was blocking the site!
		I insisted that it wasn&apos;t, but I was too flustered to use a technical explanation of how that was a <code>403</code> error page, something sent <strong>*by the server*</strong> when it&apos;s blocking you, and not a browser &quot;oops can&apos;t reach the site&quot; message.
		They basically said that only Web support could even look into that, so being blocked from Web support means I can&apos;t get unblocked from Web support.
		As an upper-tier customer, I wouldn&apos;t be able to get any support with anything either.
	</p>
	<p>
		There&apos;s just no winning with this company.
		This company is just so incompetent.
		You can&apos;t get service through them without <strong>*extreme*</strong> hassle.
		It&apos;s still possible by continually biking in every time there&apos;s a problem and having them contact Web support, I guess, but I&apos;m too furious to actually consider that at this point.
		So I asked them to cancel my application.
		They refused, and said it&apos;d auto-cancel, but they weren&apos;t specific.
		I asked a few questions, and if the answers were correct, after I don&apos;t telephone them later when they want me to, it&apos;ll be cancelled on me.
		So it looks like that&apos;s what&apos;s going to happen.
		I&apos;m at my wit&apos;s end with these people, for the time being.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/17.png" alt="A sandbank in a cave" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I found a sandbank in the cobble mine today.
		That was a bit strange.
		It wasn&apos;t even silver sand, but regular beach sand.
		You almost never find that underground in modern versions of Minetest Game.
		I eventually came to a waterfall though, and followed it upward first.
		After a time, I noticed kelp in the distance.
		Was there <strong>*seriously*</strong> kelp in an underground lake!?
		It turns out not though.
		The cave I was exploring was connected to the ocean near World&apos;s Navel.
		I&apos;d unknowingly made my way back to the surface world.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="clog">
	<h2>Clogged drain</h2>
	<p>
		I made my salad again, and tried to dispose of the odds and ends in the garbage disposal.
		Instead, the sink clogged.
		Joy.
		I thought I could take care of it with a plunger, but no such luck.
		I made plans to talk to the on-site manager about sending a repairperson tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		Last time, a repairperson made an appointment with me, then never showed up.
		I keep meaning to tell the on-site manager about that too, but the longer I wait, the less I even want to bring it up.
		But now, I had not only the leak from before, which has gotten worse, but also the clog.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even clogged, the sink was draining, just so slowly it couldn&apos;t be seen with the naked eye.
		I can never stop messing with problems, so I filled the sink with water before heading to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting.
		I thought maybe having water sit on the clog might loosen it.
		It was an incredibly stupid idea, especially seeing as I&apos;d tried that already.
		I&apos;d filled the sink and let it completely drain, to no avail.
		When I got home, I found the sink empty once more, filled it partway, and started messing with the clog with the plunger and the disposal (not at the same time) again.
		This time, it actually worked.
		Maybe soaking the plant debris made them softer.
		I&apos;m not sure.
		But anyway, that issue&apos;s been dealt with.
		I think I&apos;m still going to talk to the on-site manager again about the leak though.
		I really should have done that by now.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="wristwatch">
	<h2>Wristwatch</h2>
	<p>
		The past couple days, I haven&apos;t worn the wristwatch my doctor gave me.
		It&apos;s just too large.
		Even on it&apos;s smallest setting has the watch sliding around my wrist where I can&apos;t see the face.
		I&apos;ve been thinking about giving it back to the doctor.
		I think that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to do.
		I mean, it&apos;s also a pretty masculine watch, so it was always a stretch for me to try to pull it off.
		But it&apos;s not as functional for me a watch should be.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="P-38">
	<h2>P-38 can opener</h2>
	<p>
		I learned today that my fellow <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> member got impatient, and found an in-person store to buy their P-38 can opener at.
		That means the order I placed on their behalf was for nothing.
		It was just a waste of my money.
		That&apos;s rather annoying.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="tomorrow">
	<h2>Tomorrow&apos;s agenda</h2>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, I hope to check with both my credit unions, as well as my bank, and see if any of them offer <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> accounts.
		If any does, I won&apos;t check the others; I&apos;m not really comparing plans like I probably should, I&apos;m just going with my preferred institution, so I&apos;ll check them in the order I prefer them.
		I should drop off the watch tomorrow too.
		I&apos;ll head to the first credit union, then head past the second one, stop at the doctor&apos;s office, then hit it on the way back.
		And if neither have <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> options, I&apos;ll stop at the bank.
		If I finish all that early enough, the on-site manager&apos;s office hours won&apos;t have begun, so I&apos;ll wait, then talk to the on-site manager.
		Maybe I&apos;ll clean up my kitchen while I wait.
