	<h2>Obnoxious <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I woke up today to find another email from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> telling me I need to verify my identity.
		Identical to the first down to the letter, it presented the exact same problems.
		The link still leads to a page that acknowledges that I uploaded my eligibility document, doesn&apos;t allow me to upload anything else, and doesn&apos;t allow me to move on.
		Unfortunately, I stayed up pretty late last night.
		I don&apos;t even have a single excuse for it.
		But because of that, I got up late, and <strong>*really*</strong> didn&apos;t have time to deal with this before work.
		And yet I had to.
		And this time, there was a much-longer line.
		I waited in line long enough to complete my website update for the week, but didn&apos;t have time to stay any longer than that, and ended up leaving.
		I&apos;ll have to return tomorrow, when I have the day off.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had to talk to the receptionist again.
		I had to let them know to free up my spot in line for someone else.
		I mean, they&apos;d figure it out when they couldn&apos;t find me, but it&apos;d be more polite to let them know myself, not to mention that that&apos;d save time for customers behind me in line.
		I was annoyed though that I&apos;d had to come in a second time though - and would now need to come in a third time - and that the support website is blocking me.
		So I went up to the counter and asked if there was an estimated wait time, and said that I had to get to work.
		They asked when I needed to be to work, so I said now.
		Seriously, by the time I could bike home and get changed for work, it&apos;d be time to bike to work.
		They replied that there were still several customers ahead of me, and customers&apos; issues were taking longer to get through than expected, so it&apos;d be a while.
		I was about to say &apos;d have to come back tomorrow then, but they asked me if I wanted to set up an appointment so I could skip the line next time.
		Skipping the line?
		That&apos;d be nice!
		I mean, you have to take something into account.
		It takes an hour for me to get there and back to make an appointment, so assuming the wait time is under an hour, I get no benefit from an appointment normally.
		But since I was already there, my time was already lost.
		Without even mentioning that I&apos;d planned to be back tomorrow, they asked if I&apos;d be free tomorrow.
		Perfect.
		I ended up taking their earliest available appointment: 09:45.
		That&apos;s going to force me to get up, and forced me to go to bed tonight.
		I really do need to get my sleep cycle fixed, but it&apos;s heard when you primarily work night shifts.
		You can&apos;t just come home and immediately get to bed, y&apos;know?
		Your body isn&apos;t interested in sleep at right after work.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s a shame though.
		I was planning on doing laundry and making salad tonight.
		I&apos;ll probably have to do the laundry tomorrow night, after the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, which will require staying up even later than I would have had to tonight.
		Huh.
		In retrospect, maybe I shouldn&apos;t have gone with a morning appointment.
		I could have instead gone with an appointment I could have made it to on the way to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting.

	<p>
		I didn&apos;t do much digging, as there just wasn&apos;t time, but I brought my treasures to the surface to unload them.
		I need some more needles before I&apos;m prepared to go back down though.
		They&apos;re really useful for climbing to places otherwise out of reach.
