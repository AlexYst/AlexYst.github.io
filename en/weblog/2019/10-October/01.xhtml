	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that Cyrus had died, and I&apos;d been given his ashes.
		For some reason, I made plans to take a trip to the shared grave of our parent, who were also dead, and put the ashes there.
	</p>

<section id="gaffs">
	<h2>Gaffs</h2>
	<p>
		I still hadn&apos;t gotten a response from the gaff store, so I checked my credit card account.
		Sure enough, the charge has been reversed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I planned to talk to Discover support today.
		Discover isn&apos;t causing the problem, and is clearly allowing the charge to happen.
		PayPal&apos;s just being its usual, obnoxious self and reversing the charge.
		However, I thought that maybe Discover support would have some sort of advice on dealing with this.
		Instead though, I decided to try the purchase again.
		Bad idea.
		If the purchase went through this time, two things would happen: I&apos;d be spending money at a store that wasn&apos;t responding to my emails and I&apos;d be giving a part of that order&apos;s money to PayPal, a company I absolutely cannot stand.
		I figured it&apos;d be good to have another data point though before talking to Discover support.
		I could say I got charged twice, that both charges had gotten reversed, and the merchant was claiming to be unable to process the payment even thought they were clearly processing then unprocessing payments.
		Also, some part of me desperately just wanted to have the purchase work this time.
		I know of no other place to get gaffs, not to mention that I like to avoid conflict more than I should.
		After talking to Discover and finding they probably wouldn&apos;t offer any useful advise (contacting them would be such a long shot), my plan was to contact Trans*Ponder again.
		They&apos;d been the ones able to point me toward the local university for vocal lessons.
		I could ask them about places to get gaffs in town.
		I don&apos;t know of a place that sells them locally.
		I don&apos;t even know how to go about finding such a place.
		But that doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t one, and perhaps they&apos;d know where it is, if it is in fact here somewhere.
		My logic was the same as before.
		Even if this isn&apos;t a service they offer, they&apos;re literally a group of transgendered people and trans supporters.
		Just from their own experiences, they might have the answer I seek.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, the purchase went through this time.
		And despite the fact that the shop hadn&apos;t gotten back to me, I knew I&apos;d probably buy from them again soon.
		I need the gaffs, and after I&apos;ve made sure the one fits well, I&apos;ll very likely be getting more.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got home from work to find a response from the online store though.
		They were responding, I was just being impatient.
		I mean, I know I wrote on a Sunday, so I wasn&apos;t getting a response that same day.
		But I&apos;d hoped to get a response on Monday.
		That was greedy of me.
		They should see my email on Monday, maybe read it right away and maybe not, and probably get back to me within about a week.
		That would be reasonable, given that this isn&apos;t a time-sensitive issues.
		Were it time-sensitive, such as the tuition issue with the school, they should get back to me as soon as possible to keep me in the loop even if they didn&apos;t yet have the answers.
		The store&apos;s response surprised me.
		First, they informed me that they&apos;re on a sales platform, and told me which one.
		They don&apos;t have control over some of these things because of that.
		They informed me that this particular sales platform has bizarre restrictions on what payment processors they allow different types of stores to use.
		They gave one example, which was that wig stores weren&apos;t allowed to use one of the platform&apos;s options.
		This store sells wigs, making it (among other things) a wig store, so this payment processor isn&apos;t available even for non-wig-related purchases.
		With the various restrictions in place that apply to them, they&apos;re only able to take PayPal.
		They said they&apos;ve gone all the way up the support ladder trying to get an exception to the strange restrictions, but got nowhere.
		As long as they&apos;re on this platform, all they can take is PayPal.
		This also explains the bizarre error message, telling me to pick a different payment option when none were available.
		The platform doesn&apos;t have a separate error message for when only one payment processor is enabled in a given store.
		Next, they acknowledged that they saw I&apos;d tried again today, and the payment went through.
		And finally, to try to make it up to me, they gave me a code for gratis shipping on my next order.
		I appreciate the shipping code, but their taking the time to explain the problem from their end is plenty to make it up to me.
		I usually feel much better when I know what&apos;s going on, as long as you&apos;re not directly screwing me over like my school is with this tuition issue.

	<h2>Hair-removal appointment</h2>
	<p>
		My hair-removal appointment was today.
		I haven&apos;t checked my planner, but I noticed about a week ago that my appointment was in about a week, and at the time, I thought my previous appointment was about a week prior.
		I might just be losing time due to how stressed I am, but I think the doctor accidentally booked me two weeks out from the prior appointment instead of their recommended four.
		I&apos;m not going to argue about it though.
		My hair is still growing, and maybe getting an extra treatment it will help fix that faster.
	</p>
	<p>
		We talked about things as usual, and they said they should have photographed me before my first treatment, so we could compare to now.
		Then they said that I probably have photos, so I explained that because I&apos;ve always hated my appearance, I don&apos;t.
		I tend to shy away from cameras and mirrors.
		They&apos;re unwelcome reminders.
		They figured with all the weight I&apos;ve been losing between appointments, that I&apos;d like how I look now.
		So I reminded them that I still look like a man, and I&apos;m not one.
		I don&apos;t like looking like one.
		Noticing how depressing I sounded, I quickly added that I was working on various things, but I still had more I needed to get done, and brought up a few examples.
		One thing I mentioned needing was to figure out how to fix my eyebrows to be less manly.
		I tried shaving half of them off to make them thinner once, but that hadn&apos;t gone well.
		The doctor said they think what I need to do is fill them in, and that confused me for a bit.
		I thought they meant to make them bushier or thicker.
		I think they actually mean to take a pencil and colour in the space between the hairs.
		And now that they mention it, my eyebrow hair is a bit sparse.
		That has me worried.
		I don&apos;t really like the look of makeup.
		I don&apos;t mean on me, either, but on anyone.
		In general, people look a lot nicer, I think, without the stuff.
		I&apos;m not convinced eyebrow pencil makeup is going to be any better.
		They said they&apos;d fill in my eyebrows to show me how it would look after the treatment, but we both forgot, so that didn&apos;t happen.
		As I write this, I was going to say it was likely mostly my anxiousness to get out of there that was the issue, as my boss unexpectedly scheduled me for an earlier shift today, and I didn&apos;t want to be late to work.
		I&apos;d already made this appointment though, and didn&apos;t want to cancel it.
		Now that I think of it though, I only left after they thought their next client was going to arrive soon, and they said they needed to clean up the treatment room.
		We both had things we needed to get to, not just me.
	</p>
	<p>
		The doctor asked me if I had work today, then asked if I was going straight there.
		I would have gone straight there, but I was a bit behind schedule, and in my rush, forgot to bring my work uniform to the appointment.
		They started adding up time, and it sounded like my treatment had ended half an hour later than I&apos;d expected it to, so I asked if I&apos;d gotten there late.
		I&apos;d hoped to pop open my laptop and check the time in the waiting room when I got there, but they&apos;d been sitting at their desk instead of in the back room like they usually are when I arrive, so I didn&apos;t get that opportunity.
		They said I was on time as always, so I replied that I hadn&apos;t been sure because I don&apos;t have a clock any more.
		I didn&apos;t mention why, but it&apos;s because my mobile died on me.
		One thing led to another, and they offered me a watch.
		It seems someone they know got involved in a scam, and ended up having a bunch of watches they didn&apos;t want and had to buy anyway.
		They gave a bunch to the doctor ant their partner, so the doctor said they might be able to give me one.
		So I might end up with a watch soon.
		A while back, before I managed to get my mobile partly working last time, I&apos;d thought about getting a watch.
		I haven&apos;t had time to look into that though.
		It&apos;d bee cool to have one though, and it&apos;d make me feel a bit old-fashioned, in a good way.
		My guess is that they&apos;ll forget, and I won&apos;t bring it up, but it&apos;d be kind of a fun treat if it did end up happening.

	<p>
		I didn&apos;t really do anything productive in Minetest today.
		There just wasn&apos;t time.
		I ended up being a bit counterproductive though instead.
		I dug a passage in the sand, marking where the stone is too deep to grow my pine farm.
		That doesn&apos;t help at all, and now I&apos;ve got to fill that line in with snow before I go any further with anything.
		What I should have done, and what I plan to do next, is dig a line in the sand showing where I can fill in with water.
		After that, I can work on digging away the sand outside that line, get the area filled, and start work on the dam.

<section id="weblog">
	<h2>Rewriting history</h2>
	<p>
		Someone sent me another one of those emails trying to get me to add a link to their website to a past journal entry.
		It&apos;s like these people can&apos;t tell it&apos;s a journal, and that you don&apos;t add new content to old pages.
		They never ask me to add links to new entries, only old ones.
		Honestly, I think they&apos;ve got some sort of robot scraping pages for things that their pages might be relevant to.
		Anyway, I wrote back asking what terms their page was provided under.
		They mentioned I&apos;d linked to another resource, which happened to be Wikipedia, so I used Wikipedia&apos;s <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported">CC BY-SA 3.0</abbr> license as an example, and asked what terms apply to their page.
		I don&apos;t expect to get a response though.

	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		The school sent me one of their automated messages.
		It seems I can re-register for the courses I was supposed to take this term this Sunday.
		I guess I&apos;ll get right on that, as soon as registration opens.
