	<p>
		I woke up feeling a lot better, so I figured I&apos;d attend the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting after all.
		After a couple hours though, my nose started to run again and my lungs got all gunked up again.
		So no dice.
		I went out to get the cashier&apos;s cheque and mail it to the Department of Revenue, but otherwise just stayed home all day.

	<p>
		I got the mine started finally.
		I found a fair amount of minerals, but none of them are useful to me for the time being.
		Sadly, what I really need the mine for right now is just basic cobble for tools.
		Stone is all around, but I don&apos;t like digging it up on the surface world and making the place ugly.
		Instead, I like to dig it up as I extend my mine shafts.

<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		Late in the day, I somehow got disoriented and thought I&apos;d just woken up for the day and was late for something.
		The illness must still be worse than is feels, so I decided to actually go to sleep.
	</p>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was walking down a wide, paved path in the dark with a group of people.
		A small dog came up to me, and I picked it up for a bit.
		I had a computer chair with me for some reason, which I was wheeling down the path, and it fell apart, so I set the dog down on the remaining seat part, which was upright, and set about gathering the pieces.
		I was about to take the dog off the chair, put it on the ground, and move on.
		I&apos;d taken the dog about two metres, and wasn&apos;t going to bring it any further.
		I had no idea where it came from, and wasn&apos;t trying to keep it.
		An pissed off person came over, took the dog by the scruff of the neck, and carried it in a very rough way.
		They told me if I ever touched their dog again, they&apos;d throw it at me.
		I apologised, worried about how the dog was soon to be treated, and said I didn&apos;t realise it was their dog when I&apos;d played with it.
		They accused me of trying to steal a dog without even knowing who it belonged to, and I brought up that I hadn&apos;t actually taken it very far.
		It could easily see and be seen from the distance I&apos;d carried it.
		(I mean, if I laid down and stretched out as far as I could, I might be able to cover about two metres from the tips of my fingers to the tips of my toes.)
		That really ticked off the owner.
		I bolted, and they threw the dog at me, missing.
		At that point, things got unrealistic.
		They jumped high into the air, probably about fifteen metres, and lunged at me.
		I tried to throw the computer chair remains at them to defend myself, and missed, so I took one of the dough racks from work, which I somehow now had on me, and swung that at them, swatting them down.
		There&apos;s no way I could swing one of those so easily, but also, I hit them down while they were still out of range of the combined length of the rack and my arm, so I&apos;m not sure how that worked.
		I left them with the rack on top of them, and continued running.
		In retrospect, maybe I should have gone back and actually tried to kidnap the dog, just to rescue it.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I woke up, I found my Minetest character still digging and placing the pile of gravel I&apos;d given them.
		I hadn&apos;t been out long enough to finish one stack.
		It was a good thing, too; when I cleared away the gravel, I found I was standing on my wooden bridge.
		My unattended character would have dug a hole in the bridge and down into the snow below, had I left it unattended much longer.
		I need to be more careful about where I leave the character when I step out or take a nap.
		It&apos;s not all that far to the tunnel with the mine in it, and the stone floor there would prevent such issues.
