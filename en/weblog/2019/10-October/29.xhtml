<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I experimented with the Minetest Mapper today, to try to find the map size limit.
		I found that if I went too high, the mapper segfaulted, but if I got the mapped limits far enough out but not far enough to segfault, the maps generated froze my machine when I tried to view them.
		I seriously waited fifteen minutes for the machine to unfreeze the first time, thinking it might just be taking a while to load.
		Nope.
		No suck luck.
		The maps were choking the machine.
		I imagine it&apos;s still possible that the maps were just taking forever to load, and might have needed more time, but if it takes upward of fifteen minutes to load the things, they&apos;re too large.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found that if maps were larger than 4096 in either direction, the mapper issued a warning, but would attempt to generate the maps anyway.
		And some map sizes above this limit were still viable, though not fully visible on the screen all at once.
		There seemed to be a difference between the size that would issue the warning and the size that the warning was about, but this turned out not to be the case.
		I could go up to seven nodes higher in either direction when I specified the desired size, but I later noticed the image size wasn&apos;t actually exceeding this limit.
		The mapper was rounding to the nearest multiple of sixteen; I think it&apos;s mapping only entire blocks, not individual nodes.
		And that&apos;s fine, as long as I know its doing that.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure what size I&apos;m going to use for my map segments, but I&apos;ll probably just divide the map into a sixteen by sixteen grid, with a one-block overlap.
		That&apos;s the smallest number of images it would take to cover the entire world without warnings being issued, and the smallest overlap that allows all the maps to be the same size and have the same amount of overlap on all sides.
		I might even move the main roads to run along these overlaps, or in the case of the edge sections, the places there would be an overlap if the map continued on.
		I think I&apos;ll try to keep all my game play within the boundaries of a single one of these sectors though, and only have one sector to map out.
		Things outside the edge will be generated as I get close enough for them to be in view, but they&apos;ll be the natural terrain, and as I won&apos;t explore these areas, it won&apos;t be useful to map them.

<section id="milk">
	<h2>Almond milk</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been nearly out of soy milk for a while now, but I also haven&apos;t been using it much, so I haven&apos;t done anything about it.
		Today though, I figured I&apos;d pick some more up while I was out on my Tuesday errands though.
		I&apos;d have time.
		I get it from a dollar store though, which doesn&apos;t always have it.
		And today, I found that they&apos;d replaced the unsweetened soy milk with sweetened vanilla almond milk.
		I was excited at first, as I prefer almond milk, and especially vanilla almond milk.
		But then I noticed it was sweetened.
		I&apos;m not sure how this is going to affect my baking.
		Maybe I need to compensate by adding less sugar.
		It&apos;s not going to be as good on cereal either, due to higher calorie count.

<section id="transphobia">
	<h2>Transphobia</h2>
	<p>
		While I was out, I thought about Freya&apos;s girlfriend and what happened to her.
		After a bit, I started thinking about the martial arts lessons I want to one day take.
		Putting those together, a martial art may help keep me safe as a transgendered person.
		I need to fix my voice before I can set foot in a dōjō though, and I need to finish school before I can make the time commitment for actual lessons.
		Basic self-defence skills would certainly come in handy though, should the unthinkable happen.

<section id="quitting">
	<h2>Employees quitting</h2>
	<p>
		I learned today that the day before yesterday, one of the morning crew people quit.
		They just walked out in the middle of a shift after letting the managers know, without giving notice, just like the employee from yesterday.
		So we&apos;ve lost two crew members in the past couple days.
		We also had a shift leader walk out without telling anyone, so I thought they&apos;d get fired, but it turns out they had an emergency in regards to their child.
		Still, they didn&apos;t even tell anyone they were leaving, which was incredibly irresponsible and thoughtless.
	</p>
	<p>
		People were asking me about what happened with the employee that quit yesterday.
		I pretended not to know more than what I&apos;d overheard at the end and what head manager told me.
		When it&apos;s anonymous, I don&apos;t mind spilling the details, but if you know who I&apos;m talking about, I prefer to spare people&apos;s privacy.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="tape">
	<h2>Duct tape</h2>
	<p>
		I think the main issue with the duct tape is just making sure to use enough.
		I tried to get away with using less yesterday, and that didn&apos;t go well.
		Part of this is due to sweat.
		My skin can&apos;t breathe through the tape, sweat build up, and the tape loosens.
		With more tape, there&apos;s more that has to come off before there&apos;s a slip.
		Also though, bending down and doing heavy lifting is an issue.
		I think I can bend down or lift heavy object, but if I do both at once, I&apos;m going to have issues.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		Today was Tuesday, so I got my home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment taken care of.
		I meant to do it before work, but I let myself get distracted until I didn&apos;t feel I had time for it, and had to do it after work instead.
