<section id="swimming">
	<h2>Swimming lessons</h2>
	<p>
		I woke up exhausted.
		My workmate gave me such short notice that they even wanted to go today, that I had to stay up late to get ready.
		I don&apos;t think they realise that I can&apos;t just pick up and go at a moment&apos;s notice.
		I don&apos;t think they think about the fact that I have to shave my entire body before I can go out with such little cover.
		Anyway, I laid in bed for about half an hour, not wanting to get going, then finally forced myself to get started.
		But I sort of hoped my workmate had cancelled on me, with how tired I was, so I checked my email.
		Sure enough, their partner is having more health problems, and they want to be there for them for a doctor appointment they have today.
		They said they feel really bad about cancelling on me three weeks in a row.
		I told them not to worry about me, and that the health issues by far take priority.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have two notes though, that I didn&apos;t tell them.
		First, I think they thought they had plans with me last week, but they didn&apos;t.
		They told me they&apos;d let me know if they could make it, but then didn&apos;t let me know until <strong>*that morning*</strong> that they couldn&apos;t.
		We had <strong>*not*</strong> set up a meet time, and given that the night before - Tuesday night - is laundry night when we don&apos;t have plans on Wednesday morning, I stayed up doing laundry and didn&apos;t get up in the morning until after they&apos;d said we weren&apos;t going.
		I even checked my email all they way up until I went to bed, and they&apos;d gone to bed without letting me know.
		If you don&apos;t have a meet time set up with me by the time I go to bed, you don&apos;t have a morning meet with me; I haven&apos;t set an alarm to get up by!
		The further in advance you let me know though, the better.
		Before I go to bed is just the absolute deadline for morning meets.
		I can deal with a cancellation on a dime, but you can&apos;t schedule something with me while I&apos;m asleep.
		So from my perspective, they&apos;ve only cancelled on me twice, and not on consecutive weeks.
		Secondly, I honestly don&apos;t mind them cancelling on me when things come up.
		What I mind is the short notice in <strong>*scheduling*</strong>, not cancelling.
		Next time if this happens, I&apos;m going to tell them about the full-body shaving, how time-consuming it is, that it&apos;s not the only thing I have to do to get ready even, and that if they don&apos;t give me more notice than just the night before, I&apos;ve got to stay up late to do it and be exhausted for our meet.
		I&apos;ll tell them I&apos;m not doing that, and that I&apos;ll be too tired for swimming lessons to be feasible.
		They need to give me at least two night&apos;s notice, so I can get the shaving done in advance.
		This time though, I&apos;ve said nothing.

	<p>
		The investment company wrote back, telling me to pass their telephone number to my financial advisor and have them telephone them because I don&apos;t have telephone service.
		Um.
		What?
		Even if I had a financial advisor, which is a huge assumption on their part, if my advisor had telephone service and I was fine with doing this over the telephone, why would I not just have my financial advisor make the call without their needing to tell me?
		My response:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span title="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			I don&apos;t exactly have a financial advisor, and telephoning isn&apos;t an option.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alright, if there&apos;s no way to manage my account without telephone service, how do I transfer my money out of my account and close it? I can&apos;t exactly keep an account that I you won&apos;t even let me manage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I harvested a few trees for their snow and finished more of the bridge&apos;s edging, but I wasn&apos;t feeling up to much, so I didn&apos;t finish the project.
		It&apos;s a little closer to done though.

<section id="headache">
	<h2>Heeadach</h2>
	<p>
		Soon after I woke up, I found a headache setting in.
		I&apos;m not sure if it was due to the lack of sleep or not.
		The lack of sleep seems like the most-likely cause to me.
		Usually, if I don&apos;t get enough sleep, I&apos;m just exhausted, but I think I recall this sort of thing happening in the past when I combine lack of sleep with getting up by an alarm.
		If I wake up naturally after not having gotten to bed early enough, I still wake up too soon, but cutting that even shorter doesn&apos;t have great results for me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up trying to go back to sleep after my workmate cancelled on me, but that didn&apos;t work, and I spent most of the day just laying in bed, not feeling up to much.
		I finally forced myself to go grocery shopping before the night was over though, just to keep up my daily biking streak.
		And then, of course, I had to get today&apos;s website update finished, which involved writing up this entry and getting my photographs chosen and side bars added to them.
		Other than that, I really didn&apos;t get much done today.
