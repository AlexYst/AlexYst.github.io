<section id="g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename">
	<h2><code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code></h2>
	<p>
		My previous implementation of <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> was just the body of the <code>g_utf8_collate_key()</code> function copied over the <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> function&apos;s body.
		This morning, I came up with something more compact and closer to how I actually want things sorted.
		It simply duplicates the input string and returns its pointer.
		I hope.
		I don&apos;t actually know C, so this function might result in compile errors, segfaults, or other issues.
		I was too nervous to test it today, but I should test it soon.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I was trying to find information about the Minetest Mapper, a program that takes Minetest world data and generates a <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr> map of what a section of it would look like at a distance from above.
		Specifically, I was trying to find its size limitations.
		If you try to make the <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr> map cover too much space, the Minetest Mapper fails.
		If I recall correctly, there&apos;s no hard limit, but rather, memory shortage gets to be an issue.
		But I wanted to know if I was wrong, and there actually was a hard limit for me to work with.
		I didn&apos;t see any information about limits, but I ended up needing to check some code in Minetest Game, and rather than look it up in my own local copy, I checked the repo.
		There, I found a <code>5.1.0</code> tag; investigating, I found 5.1.0had been released earlier in the month.
		Nice!
	</p>
	<p>
		I got Minetest 5.1.0 compiled and I looked through Minetest Game&apos;s creative inventory, but I didn&apos;t see anything that looked like it was of relevance to <code>liblevelup</code>.
		That&apos;s really what I&apos;ve got to check for with each release.
		There are certainly some new nodes to play with in-game, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything I&apos;ve got to code around.
		I&apos;ll have to do a more-thorough investigation, including a scan of node drops, before I do anything else Minetest-related, but it looks like there are no new elements to account for.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		Today was Saturday, so I had another home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="leak">
	<h2>The leak mostly stopped?</h2>
	<p>
		Today, I found that my kitchen sink has mostly stopped leaking.
		I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s going on.
		It didn&apos;t magically fix itself, obviously, so it&apos;s still got a problem.
		If it doesn&apos;t start leaking again by the time the repairperson comes though, they might not see all where needs to be fixed, and the job might not get done properly.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="shopping">
	<h2>Shopping</h2>
	<p>
		I went shopping for used black pants for work again.
		I figured I&apos;d get another four pair, bringing me up to eight.
		I typically need five pairs, one for each work day, but I sometimes need six pairs, and it&apos;d be nice to have a couple spare pairs in case some wear through.
		Of the four pairs I tried on though, only one was suitable.
		Last time, I found that the pairs that fit me were all size fourteen, so I figured I&apos;m a size fourteen.
		This time though, three size-fourteen pairs were too small though.
		On this other sizing scale, I might be a size sixteen or something.
	</p>
	<p>
		I could have gone looking for more black pants after finding the three pairs didn&apos;t fit, but I didn&apos;t feel like it.
		I should have gone looking for pants to use as street clothing, but I didn&apos;t think of it until it was too late.
		Instead, I went looking at shirts.
		I found two that are a nice size mostly, though I wish they were a bit longer without being wider.
		I&apos;m too fat for the third, but I think it&apos;ll look very nice on me once I lose the belly.
		Now, the main thing I need are pants for when I&apos;m off the clock, but that&apos;s nothing I need urgently.
