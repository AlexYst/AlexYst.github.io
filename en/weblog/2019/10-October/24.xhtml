<section id="IRA">
	<h2>Dealing with the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I went to my appointment today fully intending to move all my funds from my existing <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> to a new, better one, with actual support.
		Long story short, that didn&apos;t end up happening.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, I learned that the tellers at the credit union aren&apos;t able to access the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> accounts to add funds to them.
		In fact, they can&apos;t even see the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> accounts at all.
		The teller I spoke with before shouldn&apos;t&apos;ve told me the partnership with the third-party investment firm had ended.
		The simple fact is though that these tellers aren&apos;t trained to understand they don&apos;t have access to these accounts, so when this one couldn&apos;t see the account, they assumed it couldn&apos;t be accessed from the credit union any more, and that the partnership must have ended.
		Basically, they made up garbage in their head to fill in the gaps in their actual knowledge.
		In order to actually contribute to my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> through, I have to make an appointment with a licensed advisor.
		Every time.
		That seems like a pain, as I&apos;ve got to set up an appointment each time, but there&apos;s a $6000 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> yearly limit on contributions.
		(That yearly limit makes it all the more frustrating that I was told the partnership had ended, as I would have otherwise contributed last year, too.)
		Because of that limit, I only have to set up one appointment each year, at the beginning of the year, and put in as much as I can from my savings account.
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondly, the financial advisor recommended that I not go through the investment company directly anyway.
		The credit union doesn&apos;t even go directly through them.
		They have a partnership with this other company, and that other company has the partnership with the investment firm.
		The credit union send all contributions through this middleperson company.
		They said that if I want to access my account online, I should do so through this other company, not through the investment firm itself.
		Except ... that the account is read-only from there.
		It&apos;s practically useless.
		I can&apos;t make contributions online except through the investment firm itself, which the financial advisor, again, recommends against doing.
		Once more, contributions to the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> are to be made through one of the credit union&apos;s licensed advisors, in a by-appointment, in-person meet.
	</p>
	<p>
		So anyway, I wasn&apos;t sure what to think.
		I don&apos;t want to deal with this unhelpful <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company, but it seems that the middleperson company is the one that put my money there?
		So it&apos;s probably pointless to try to get them to move it elsewhere.
		I mean, I could probably get them to do it, but to what ends?
		I&apos;m not supposed to contact the investment companies myself anyway, so it doesn&apos;t really matter how little support they provide investors.
		I ended up leaving the account how I found it, and just asking the financial advisor to, since I had them there anyway, move my six thousand for the year into the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> account, which they said they&apos;d do later today.
		I guess that takes care of the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> issue, for the time being.
	</p>
	<p>
		I planned to try to log into the new website I was shown, then set up another appointment if this one refuses to allow me access too.
		But what&apos;s the point?
		This website is useless to me if all it does is show me what I&apos;ve got saved.
		I already see what I&apos;ve got saved every month on my statement, which the investment company sends me via post.
		It&apos;s just not worth my time right now to bother with the website.

<section id="baking">
	<h2>Baking</h2>
	<p>
		So I tried the ridiculous glass bowel on top of a pot of boiling water setup for melting the chocolate.
		It works.
		What the Squid.
		Seriously.
		Why does this work?
		I&apos;m told it heats the chocolate more gently than what I was doing before, which was just putting it in the oven on top of the brownies.
		I get why this might keep the chocolate from burning.
		Kind of.
		But why does this make it melt?
		When I put the chocolate in the oven, it wasn&apos;t burning <strong>*and*</strong> melting, it was just burning.
		It melted a little, but not much, and I cooked it quite a bit longer.
		Why was it not melting?
		And even once the chocolate cooled quite a bit, it stayed melted.
		I really don&apos;t get it.
		Clearly, I don&apos;t know how to bake.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, the brownies were appreciated by my doctor.
		I&apos;m not sure if they thought I was a bit of a jerk before when I hadn&apos;t brought them, but I certainly did.
		And while I still think I was a jerk for not thinking of it right away, it doesn&apos;t seem like the doctor thinks ill of me any more, if they ever did.
	</p>

<section id="memories">
	<h2>Memories</h2>
	<p>
		I finished my page on how I came to be a Debian user.
		After that, I worked on sorting the remaining notes into groups I could use for other pages.

<section id="merchant">
	<h2>Aggravating merchant</h2>
	<p>
		The P-38 can openers I bought for a fellow <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> member were due to arrive today, and they never did.
		So I checked my credit card statement.
		Sure enough, the charge had been reversed.
		The merchant cancelled my order on me without even telling me!
		This is getting really aggravating.
		That&apos;s two merchants that&apos;ve done this recently now.
		There&apos;s absolutely no excuse for this behaviour.
		If you&apos;re going to cancel an order on someone, at least <strong>*notify them*</strong>, so they&apos;re not waiting for something that&apos;ll never arrive.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> member that needed these already got impatient and found an in-person store that sold them, so this time, I don&apos;t even need the order.
		It worked out that it&apos;d gotten cancelled, it just wasn&apos;t okay for them to do it without even telling me.
