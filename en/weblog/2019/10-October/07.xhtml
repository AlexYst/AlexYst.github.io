	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I think the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment is finally making my moustache less bristly.
		That course hair&apos;s been rather annoying, to say the least.
		The <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> has been bleaching it out, so I haven&apos;t had to deal with the moustache look for months, but it&apos;s been disheartening that whenever I brush my upper lip, I&apos;m met with skin so rough it could be sandpaper.
		I still feel a lot of hair there, but it&apos;s much softer than before.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="to-do">
	<h2>To-do list</h2>
	<p>
		I finally got back to work on my to-do list today.
		I didn&apos;t get done as much as I should have, but I typed up all my recipes that I&apos;ve been meaning to get online, and that&apos;s a start.
		Tomorrow will be busy, so I likely won&apos;t get anything done, but I should probably focus on restoring access to my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> account.
		Either that, or I should work on typing up old memories, which is one of my rather time-consuming to-do list items.
		If I can just get started, maybe I could type up one page per day or something.
		That way, I&apos;d finish eventually.
		As it stands, I haven&apos;t even gotten started.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/07.png" alt="The bridge, with a snow border on one side and a missing border on the other" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve completely removed the wooden stairs from the bridge now, and I&apos;ve crafted the stairs back into planks, to use for other things.
		So far, mostly axe handles for removing the wooden stairs and chopping down more trees for their snow.
		I&apos;ve lost a bit of material and a decent chunk of time by not building the bridge correctly to begin with.
		I&apos;m a bit over halfway done installing the snow stairs in place of the wooden ones, but I still have quite a bit left to do on that, including chop down even more trees and gather even more snow.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started thinking of new ideas of what I can use the elemental crystals for again.
		I mean, they&apos;re probably just about perfect, for my use, but it might be nice to make them more interesting for other players.
		At one point in the day, I toyed with the idea of making the crystals slowly accumulate energy as they sit on the map.
		I&apos;m not sure what the energy would be used for, but one option was for renewing normally-finite materials.
		If I did that, I&apos;d probably start over the game again, as that&apos;s not what I&apos;ve been building my in-game home around.
		I ended up scrapping the idea for unrelated reasons though.
		I mean, the rarity of finite elements would be undermined if I made them renewable.
		I&apos;d honestly like they to be renewable, but I want them renewable in the base subgame, not because of my add-on.
		It&apos;s not the same if I add it, and I&apos;d rather have these materials exist in finite quantities than add renewal mechanics myself.
		Or at least, I&apos;d rather deal with the rarity when in a single-player world.
		If I ran a public server, I&apos;d most certainly make everything renewable in some way.

<section id="gaff">
	<h2>Gaff</h2>
	<p>
		My gaff arrived in the mail today.
		I checked for it before work, but the mail predictably hadn&apos;t arrived yet.
		The mail routes seem to have gotten altered a few months ago, and we&apos;ve got a different letter carrier now.
		Since then, the mail tends to arrive when I&apos;m at work.
		When I got home though, I found it waiting for me.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first think I noticed was that both transaction attempts had been recorded on the invoice.
		At first, I thought it odd they&apos;d bothered to tie the two together.
		I mean, the employee I spoke with clearly connected the dots, but there was no point to make a note in the system.
		The two separate attempts would appear to be two separate customers, aside from the fact that the credit card details and shipping address were the same, but as they were using a middleman as a payment processor, they wouldn&apos;t see the credit card.
		But them I remembered: I&apos;d made the attempts on separate days, but I&apos;d done it from the same shopping cart instance.
		I tried to make the purchase, then left the cart page open for when support staff wrote back, then tried the purchase from that same cart instance on another day.
		Of course both attempts would show up as the same transaction to the system!
	</p>
	<p>
		The next thing I noticed was that the invoice mentioned a gratis gift.
		A bonus item?
		They didn&apos;t need to do that!
		Curious as to what it was, I rummaged through the envelope, and found a small makeup kit.
		Interesting.
		The chances of my using this any time soon are abysmally low.
		Honestly, I think most people look far better without makeup.
		There&apos;s the woman-style way of using makeup, and the drag-style way of using makeup.
		The woman-style way makes you look like a porcelain doll.
		If that&apos;s what you&apos;re going for, by all means, go for it.
		But in my opinion, it makes your skin look so perfect that it doesn&apos;t look natural, and doesn&apos;t look human.
		I don&apos;t find it attractive.
		Then there&apos;s the drag-style makeup.
		You&apos;re just begging to look out of place when you wear your makeup that way.
		If you want to stand out with a look that screams &quot;I&apos;m actually a man, but I&apos;m trying to dress like a woman&quot;, again, go for it.
		But I think natural skin looks better on men and women alike, so I see no reason why someone that&apos;s neither man nor woman would look any better in it.
		Makeup&apos;s just not for me, at least for the time being, though I might one day try it just to see what it&apos;s like.
		I mean, I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d enjoy shaved legs either, but smooth leg skin is actually rather enjoyable, not just for the appearance of it, but for the feel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I tried on the gaff itself.
		Tomorrow will be my full-day test run of the thing, but I figured I could get a preview tonight.
		I was ... quite a bit disappointed.
		The thing&apos;s  much stretchier than I&apos;d thought it would be, and that meant my scrotum still created a bulge.
		I can keep the testicles up inside me, but I can&apos;t keep the scrotum up there.
		Even if I wad it up and shove it in, it comes right back out.
		Desperately, I figured maybe I got a size too large, and considered ordering a smaller pair.
		That wouldn&apos;t help though.
		The fabric is too stretchy.
		I adjusted my genitals several times, trying to find some position I could get my masculine bulge to disappear in.
		Finally, I figured it out.
		I can actually get the scrotum to stay between my legs, instead of in front of them, a feat not possible with my makeshift gaff.
		Believe me, I tried that several times.
		I think the secret is the gaff&apos;s fabric.
		It&apos;s stretchier than I&apos;d like it to be, which is less than ideal, but it&apos;s gentile enough that it can be put directly on my skin while still gripping the skin enough to keep the skin mostly where I put it.
		I think this is going to work rather well.
	</p>
	<p>
		My one complaint is that this gaff doesn&apos;t cover enough in the back.
		It&apos;s basically a thong back there.
		It has not choice but to rest <strong>*in*</strong> my butt crack, which is going to take some getting used to.
		After the test run, when I see that this will hold throughout the day, I&apos;ll probably see if the shop online has other options.
		Something wider would definitely be more comfortable.
