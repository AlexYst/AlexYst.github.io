<section id="ISP">
	<h2><abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		The <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> emailed me about paperless billing.
		There shouldn&apos;t be any billing at all though, as I&apos;ve asked twice now for the service to be cancelled before it even started.
		And it still hasn&apos;t started.
		I guess I&apos;ll head back to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s store tomorrow to get that dealt with.
		I&apos;d&apos;ve done it this morning, but I don&apos;t think they&apos;re open on Sundays.

<section id="bottle-redemption">
	<h2>Bottle-redemption</h2>
	<p>
		I finally got my redeemable bottles returned for deposit today.
		I&apos;ve been putting that off for too long, and they&apos;ve been stacking up.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="basket">
	<h2>Bike basket</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve had an old bike basket for a while now that I&apos;ve been meaning to install.
		It&apos;s one of those ones that goes on the back, and collapses when you don&apos;t need it.
		I&apos;ve been unsure of if it&apos;s actually functional, as it looks like it might be broken, and I was never able to see how it was supposed to be attached securely.
		Today, I finally tried to perform the installation.
		I found that it indeed won&apos;t work on my bike, but that could be either because the basket is broken as suspected or because my bike is so janky.
		Seriously, it&apos;s hard to get anything onto this bike, as the assumptions made by manufacturers making bike accessories don&apos;t apply to this particular bicycle.
		I&apos;m not sure where I&apos;m going to get a used bike basket, given that the old recycling centre now doesn&apos;t carry much bike stuff any more and I never see this sort of thing in the second-hand stores.

<section id="g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename">
	<h2><code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code></h2>
	<p>
		I tried compiling and installing my changes to <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> on <a href="/en/domains/bailey.local.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a>.
		That didn&apos;t work out so well.
		Now I can&apos;t open the file manager; it just crashes right away.
		Honestly, I&apos;m not sure how to fix this stupid <code>glib</code> issue.
		It&apos;s be nice if the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> developers actually listened to the thousands of users complaining about their sorting algorithm and gave us a configuration option to turn it off.
	</p>
	<p>
		I give up and tried just installing LXDE, which isn&apos;t officially supported on PureOS.
		As I assumed would happen, I lost access to right and middle click functionality, as <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> emulates these mouse buttons to deal with the fact that the Librem hardware doesn&apos;t have them.
		So using a reasonable desktop isn&apos;t an option.
		I&apos;m stuck with <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr>.
		I&apos;m getting real fed up with both the Librem hardware and with <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> though.
		I might need to invest in a more-functional computer soon, and that saddens me.
		Not only is this the most-expensive laptop I&apos;ve ever owned, but it&apos;s also the closest laptop I&apos;ve ever had to having fully-open specifications.
		This should in theory be the best laptops I&apos;ve ever had, but it&apos;s been the very worst, if you don&apos;t count the ones that are so <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr>-laden that they won&apos;t even boot with a functional Wi-Fi card installed.
		This Librem though, while obviously better than those ones, has caused me quite a bit more frustration, as at least with those <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr>-laden machines, I could write them off right away without any further investment of time or energy.

<section id="voice">
	<h2>Vocal advice</h2>
	<p>
		A workmate offered to talk to Freya&apos;s girlfriend, who&apos;s a transwoman, to ask about alternative and potentially-quicker solutions for my vocal issue.
		I declined, saying that I could just email Freya if I was going to do that.
		I wasn&apos;t going to actually email Freya though.
		I figured that&apos;d be way awkward.
		I&apos;d be trying to get help from someone after declining the friendship of her partner.
		In my defence, I said I&apos;d be more than happy to be her friend if she&apos;d stop misgendering me, but still.
		Anyway, it seems my workmate didn&apos;t listen, and contacted them about it anyway, asking them to contact me.
		So this is going to be even more awkward.
		Thanks.
		Thanks for not listening to me.
		I guess I should&apos;ve been more explicit and more blunt about the situation.
		I didn&apos;t want to make Freya look bad though.
		And now, I had to explain the situation to them anyway, but now with a potential awkward email exchange with Freya&apos;s girlfriend now.
		Unless she decide not to contact me because she recognises my name and doesn&apos;t want to talk to me.
		I mean, I figure there&apos;s a high probability that either she isn&apos;t going to want to talk to me because I rejected her girlfriend&apos;s friendship or she&apos;s going to be the type to misgender me too, so I&apos;m not going to want her help.
