	<h2>Package from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I wasn&apos;t paying as much attention yet as I should have, as I thought the package from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> was still a ways off.
		Thankfully, the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> gave the shipping company my email address (without my permission, by the way), and they emailed me telling me they&apos;re going to deliver the package tomorrow.
		SO I know to stay home tomorrow morning and wait for them.

<section id="tape">
	<h2>Duct tape</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;d hit a brick wall.
		I was out of ideas of how to make tucking work, aside from duct tape, which sounded painful, and this one homemade gaff type I keep hearing about, that seems like it&apos;d be no more effective than professional gaffs.
		The idea is to cut up a tube sock and nylons, and assemble them into a gaff.
		But why would that work any better than anything else?
		I mean, if something simple and homemade was a known-working solution, why would the professional ones not incorporate the mechanics the homemade one makes use of, but in a way that doesn&apos;t look so stupid?
		I honestly didn&apos;t think it worth my time to even go buy nylons just to cut them up, as I don&apos;t think this solution would be any more effective than what I&apos;ve tried.
		And that left me with the tape idea.
		Ouch.
	</p>
	<p>
		So that&apos;s what I tried today.
		Before I went to bed last night, I shaved, then tucked and taped.
		And I slept in it.
		It was itchy, but not too uncomfortable to sleep in.
		I took it off today so I could use the restroom and shower, then retucked and retaped in time for work.
		It doesn&apos;t shift or come off during my by-bike commute.
		It holds all day.
		It does hurt a bit coming off, and I can&apos;t use the restroom in public unless I both have the time to slowly and carefully get the tape off and have brought a roll of duct tape to retuck with, but this works far better than anything I&apos;ve tried up to this point, including the tiny jock strap.
		I guess this is what I&apos;ll be doing from now on.
		I needed some thinner pants though, most of mine are so masculine and baggy.
		I don&apos;t need baggy pants any more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before work, I stopped by the second-hand store next door to my workplace.
		You&apos;re only allowed to bring up to four articles of clothing into the dressing room at that place, and I didn&apos;t want to bother getting a cart to store other soon-to-be purchases in, so I just tried on four pairs of work pants and bought those.
		If not for the limit, I would have gotten five pairs, one for each day I typically work between laundry loads.
		I&apos;ll pick up more later though, along with some off-the-clock pants.
		I didn&apos;t tuck as well today as I did last night.
		I noticed that before I&apos;d finished taping, but didn&apos;t want to waste tape, and it was too late to adjust, so I went with what I had.
		Because of my poor tucking job, one of that pairs of pants I got wouldn&apos;t look good to wear at work today.
		The other three were perfect though.
		And as I practice, I&apos;ll get better at tucking with tape.
		I won&apos;t need to be careful about which day I wear that particular pair, which I think might be my favourite, due to the trim at the bottom of the legs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can&apos;t properly emphasise just how much better the duct tape solution works than anything else I&apos;ve tried so far.
		With even my best previous attempts, I had to worry about one of my testicles coming back down into my scrotum, so when I got down low to reach the bottom shelf at work, a testicle that&apos;d fallen out of the tube would get squished, which was startling and mildly painful.
		With the tape, that&apos;s not an issue at all.
		I could probably pull of a regular, one-piece swimsuit now too, though I&apos;m morbidly curious to know how well the duct tape would hold in the water.
		Knowing I don&apos;t have a bulge any more and that I can freely wear women&apos;s pants has made me feel the girliest I&apos;ve felt in a long time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hadn&apos;t thought about it, but most of the girls at my workplace wear skin-tight leggings.
		What I got isn&apos;t skin-tight, it&apos;s just not supper baggy.
		Maybe I should&apos;ve gone for something tighter?
		At the same time though, I&apos;m not a girl.
		I don&apos;t need to dress like the other girls.
		I just need to dress in such a way that it&apos;s clear I&apos;m not a guy, either.
		This&apos;ll be increasingly important as my voice gets more and more fixed, not that that process has even been started yet.
		I&apos;m still on the waiting list, as before.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having such an effective tucking method in place really brightened my mood.
		It was like a dark cloud had lifted.
		I really had no idea how much better I&apos;d feel.
		It&apos;s really no wonder some transwomen deal with the itchiness and pain of duct tape.
		The peace of mind it brings more than makes up for the discomfort.
		Also though, if you&apos;re careful, it&apos;s not as painful as it sounds.
		It&apos;s still painful to remove, but not as much as you&apos;d think.
		I mentioned in a previous entry that knowing Summer had seen my note to her helped me feel a bit better, and I was starting to really move on.
		I was still having arguments with her in my daydreams, but they were much less heated.
		Today though, I couldn&apos;t even help but smile.
		Even in my fantasies, when I would tell her to go shove it, I was smiling; both my physical body and my daydream self smiled.
		I still want nothing to do with her, but the loathing and anger toward her is just gone now.
		At least for today.
		I&apos;m hoping this lasts though, and as I almost never have to see her face anyway, I see no reason why it wouldn&apos;t.

<section id="pronouns">
	<h2>Pronouns</h2>
	<p>
		The workmate that gave me the swimming lesson, and that claimed to respect my gender neutrality, called me a &quot;him&quot; to another workmate.
		They don&apos;t actually see me as neutral at all.
		It&apos;s disappointing, not that they don&apos;t see me as neutral, because most people don&apos;t, but because they claim to and don&apos;t.
		Without the claim, they wouldn&apos;t stand out from the thousands of other people that see me as a man.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="plans">
	<h2>Plans</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t really feel like going out today, and with my recent work schedule, I didn&apos;t feel I had time to anyway.
		As a manager, I&apos;ve usually got to be to work earlier than I did previously.
		Tomorrow, I need to stay home and wait for the package, so I can try to return it to the sender.
		When that fails, if the delivery happens early enough that there&apos;s time before work, I should take it back to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s store myself.
		The next day is Tuesday, so I have my Tuesday errands, but I also haven&apos;t taken bottles back in a while and they&apos;re piling up, so I should take care of those along the way.
		It&apos;s also the Tuesday after the twentieth of the month, meaning that I need to deposit my pay cheque and pick up my rent cheque.
		If I get going soon enough, I can also drop off my rent cheque and talk to the on-site manager about getting the sink repaired for real this time.
		It&apos;s also the day of my appointment with the dietitian though, so I might wait to pay rent and/or wait to return the bottles for deposit.
		On Wednesday, I want to bring brownies to my doctor.
		I can&apos;t afford to give much, but I can put some time and effort in to show my appreciation.
		These should probably be baked on Tuesday night.
		And finally, on Thursday, I need to drop off the package at the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s store if I wasn&apos;t able to do it tomorrow.
		I might be able to do that on the way to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, actually.
		On second thought, I should bake the brownies tomorrow while I wait for the package.
		Then I can, as long as I can keep organised, drop them off the next day.
		I think the problem with my previous attempt at brownies was just that I failed to put the chocolate layer on them after they were nearly baked.
		I need to remember to do that, and they should turn out just fine.
