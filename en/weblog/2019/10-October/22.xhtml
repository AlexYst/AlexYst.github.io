	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		When I got to the hospital, I found the doors by the bike racks locked.
		These doors lead to the stairwells, so I assumed the stairs were off-limits again.
		After heading into the building through another entrance, I headed for the stairwells anyway, where I found a notice posted.
		Entry to the stairwell was permitted, but exit from the stairwell was permitted only on the ground floor.
		Okay.
		That&apos;s a bit odd.
		I checked the door, and the one on the ground floor was actually locked from the outside.
		Entrance to the stairwell was only allowed on other floors, no doubt in part to save people who ignored the sign the effort of climbing the stairs only to find that they couldn&apos;t get to what they needed to, and have to go back down.
		Or now that I think of it, maybe so people don&apos;t climb the stairs, then wait for someone to leave a floor, taking that opportunity while the door is open to enter the floor from the stairs.
		But anyway, I had to take the elevator up just like last time, but would be free to take the stairs on the way down.
		I needed to get to the fifth floor, and annoyingly, the elevator I managed to get onto stopped at literally every floor along the way.
		I guess that&apos;s not many stops, but elevators make me feel strange, especially as they&apos;re starting and stopping, so having four starts and four stops was mildly unpleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems I&apos;ve gained a bit more weight since my last weigh-in.
		I don&apos;t remember exactly what my weight was, and I&apos;m not going to look it up in my other journal entry, but I was down to double digits.
		Now I&apos;m up to 101.7 kilograms, though that includes the weight of my shoes.
		I didn&apos;t have to take them off this time, but I&apos;ve had to take them off every other time.
		That doesn&apos;t account for my entire weight gain though; I&apos;ve been slacking on the dieting, after the depression caused by the combination of slowed weight loss (ironically) and constant thoughts of Summer, but that should be over now.
		I need to get back to my weight-loss efforts.
		I&apos;m still down from my initial weigh-in by a huge margin.
		Without shoes, I used to weigh 117.1.
		I didn&apos;t have that figure previously, as the dietitian converted it to pounds before telling me, and I had no interest in recording that, even if I could later convert it back into better units.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hilariously, the dietitian forgot that I&apos;m vegan, though remembered I&apos;m vegetarian.
		I only find it funny though because they were initially happy to learn I&apos;m vegan, as they&apos;re vegan too.
		They asked me how long I&apos;d been on a plant-based diet though, so I pulled out my journal to get the time frame on when I ditched dairy, the final thing I needed to give up, which was probably about a week before my journal starts.
		(I had a journal before that, but it was lost when my hard drive died and I lost all digital data in my possession.
		After relearning that I&apos;m vegan, they said they&apos;d send me a recipe for some non-meat meatloaf later, so I&apos;m looking forward to seeing how that turns out.
	</p>
	<p>
		The dietitian wants me to look into plank exercises.
		It sounds like they&apos;re something where you get into a push-up position, and just hold that stance.
		The dietitian said they help with building abdominal muscle, and recommended doing them daily.
		And unlike the sit-ups I&apos;ve been unable to get back to with my living room full of Summer&apos;s boxes, I don&apos;t need something to stick my feet under to keep myself in position.
		Anywhere I can fit well enough will work, meaning I can just do plank exercises in the kitchen or hallway, for example.
		They&apos;re something I can do now, or at least can do once I&apos;ve had time to look them up.
	</p>
	<p>
		The dietitian also recommended taking B12 supplements twice weekly.
		There&apos;s a couple types of B12 too, apparently.
		The right one is harder to get, and called methyl cobalamin.
		I guess I&apos;ve got to figure out where to get that.
		The dietitian also emphasised the importance of legumes and protein in vegan diets, and photo-copied some pages from a vegan dieting textbook for me to read over later.
	</p>
	<p>
		They said to email them if I had any questions, but I&apos;d actually already had a question in mind for a month or two, so I took the opportunity to ask about their notes to group participants on the hospital website.
		They didn&apos;t know what I was talking about, and said they hadn&apos;t been giving participants individualised notes that way.
		That was a relief; I hadn&apos;t missed anything they&apos;d intended to tell me, then.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got home, I found an email from the hospital had arrived with a link to register for an online account.
		Ugh.
		This again.
		However, when I tried the link, which I pretty much had to do just to verify for sure that it still wasn&apos;t going to work, I found that surprisingly, this time, it did.
		I was finally able to set up my account!
		No Social Security number was needed any more.
		Of course, it was only now, which is after the account no longer holds any utility for me that I was able to get the account set up, but if I ever return to this hospital for something, the account will already be ready for me.
		My guess as to why the email arrived today though is that the dietitian did something to help after I&apos;d mentioned the problem.
		I&apos;d brought up the problem with the receptionist before, but never the dietitian.
		I&apos;m not sure what they did to fix it though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once in the account, I messed with a few of the settings.
		First, I removed the zeroed-out telephone number they&apos;d put on the account.
		Now the field is just blank, like it should be.
		The site also allowed me to add a relationship indicator on my emergency contact.
		I used my father as my emergency contact,and I told them that when I gave them my father&apos;s name and email address, but it didn&apos;t get entered.
		The drop-down list of relationship types included both gendered and, much to my appreciation, gender-neutral choices.
		I also fixed my postal address.
		The hospital had abbreviated it.
		I don&apos;t normally care, as long as I don&apos;t see the data in the database, but if I see it like I now can, especially if I&apos;m able to update it myself, it&apos;s a little annoying not to have it spelled out properly.
		Strangely, the site also had a religion flag to set.
		Why does the hospital even care what religion their patients observe?
		Do they treat patients differently?
		With so many choices in the drop-down list, I&apos;m really not sure what the hospital is looking for, though there are in some cases special religion-related restrictions I could easily see them taking into account.
		For example, the Witnesses aren&apos;t okay with blood transfusions.
		And if you set your religion to certain Jewish variants and end up having an overnight stay, perhaps they make sure that the food they serve you is kosher.
		One option was atheist, which isn&apos;t really a religion, but I set that anyway.
		While none of the hospital&apos;s business, I do like to indicate that yes, some of us don&apos;t buy into any of this mythology.
		You can&apos;t assume everyone&apos;s a believer.
		And finally, I looked into two-factor authentication.
		I thought the site would be configured to use one of those you-must-verify-via-<abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> setups, but they don&apos;t.
		<abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> is an option, and I&apos;m perfectly cool with that as long as it&apos;s not the <strong>*only*</strong> option and isn&apos;t an option you have to set up first before switching to better options.
		Email was also prominently displayed as an option though, so I set up the account to authenticate via email when I try to log in.
		If I log into this account again, it won&apos;t be for a great while, and it&apos;d be nice to be a little more sure no one else&apos;s logging into my account in the mean time.
		If they so much as try, I&apos;ll get wind of it because of the authentication attempt being sent to my inbox.

<section id="errands">
	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		I decided I didn&apos;t have time today to deal with the redeemable bottles, so I left those at home.
		While I was out running my Tuesday errands, I ran into my father, so we talked a while.
		That made it a good thing I didn&apos;t bring the bottles for a couple reasons.
		First, our conversation took what little time I had.
		But also, dropping off the bottles always has to be the first stop I make, so I don&apos;t have to lug them into all the other buildings I stop at.
		I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve run into my father if I&apos;d brought the bottles.
	</p>
	<p>
		I deposited my pay cheque and withdrew my rent cheque though, which was the important thing to get done on the trip.
		I also bought the missing ingredients for my next attempted batch of brownies.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I got my home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair-removal treatment taken care of.
		That treatment was the main reason I didn&apos;t think I had time for the bottle-redemption errand.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="pronouns">
	<h2>Pronouns</h2>
	<p>
		After picking up the rent cheque, I waited at home for the on-site manager&apos;s office hours to begin, then went to drop it off.
		There, the apartment manager&apos;s mother saw one of my rings, and thought I was engaged.
		It&apos;s hilarious when people think that.
		My rings are on my middle fingers, not my ring fingers.
		But also, I&apos;ve never even been on a date.
		Me?
		Engaged?
		No, definitely not yet.
		So I said I wasn&apos;t even looking for someone at the moment, and that I&apos;m too busy with school, not to mention that I still need to fix my body up a bit.
		It came up that my main worry at the moment is my voice, and they didn&apos;t think there was anything wrong with it.
		Of course they didn&apos;t think there was anything wrong with it; they were listening to it from the perspective of me being a man.
		When you hear a crow cawing, you don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything wrong with its voice either, but if a pigeon or dove sounded like that, you&apos;d immediately recognise that something was amiss.
		So I pointed out that I sound like a man, but I&apos;m not one.
		I&apos;ve mentioned not being a man before to them, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		That was when the on-site manager said they had a question.
		They said I could tell them to butt out if I&apos;d liked, then asked me about my preferred pronouns.
		Awesome!
		Someone that actually cares enough to ask!
		Most people, even if I tell them without their asking, can&apos;t be bothered to make the effort.
		But if someone actually cares enough to ask, they&apos;re more likely to actually have the courtesy to try to stop misgendering me.
		That said, there&apos;s no guarantee.
		I mean, they could be like Freya, accepting transgenderedness, but not accepting non-binary-ness, but it brings me hope.
		It was hilarious that they thought I might not want to answer though, as they were asking about my preference.
		They weren&apos;t trying to pry personal information out of me, but rather, asking how I would prefer to be treated.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="prank">
	<h2>Terrible prank</h2>
	<p>
		The new assistant manager had me cover their break at the pizza dress station.
		They told me we were low on thin-crust pizzas, and warned me about throwing in too many, as we&apos;d run out prematurely.
		I joked about throwing them in judiciously.
		Already, the wheels were turning in my head for a prank.
		I&apos;d hide all the thin crust pizzas except for one, to make it believable, and tell them it was our last one.
		In retrospect, it was a terrible idea, and I shouldn&apos;t&apos;ve done it.
		I should have known better.
	</p>
	<p>
		They got back, I told them we were down to the last one, and they double-checked that I hadn&apos;t missed the ones in the refrigerator.
		I hadn&apos;t.
		Then they left to the back room without a word.
		I didn&apos;t realise they&apos;d gone, and by the time I noticed they weren&apos;t coming back to the pizza dress station, they were already on a telephone call with the head manager.
		It was too late to undo what &apos;d done.
		Lovely.
		Just lovely.
	</p>
	<p>
		So yeah, the head manager ended up needing to borrow some thin crust pizzas from another store location in the franchise and bring them in on their day off.
		That&apos;s not what I wanted.
		I just wanted to mess with the assistant manager in a playful way, then I was going to reveal what had happened, and that it&apos;d all been a joke.
		I can&apos;t do this as a boss.
		And to be honest, it&apos;s not the sort of prank I can safely pull on a boss either, even if I wasn&apos;t a boss myself.
		But as a boss myself, I really, <strong>*really*</strong> shouldn&apos;t have pulled such a prank at all.
		Why am I even one of the bosses now?
		I don&apos;t deserve such a position.
		I&apos;m too much of a jokester.
		Then again, this place isn&apos;t great, so it&apos;s not like it deserves the best bosses.
		Still, I should be the boss that would be best for my workplace, not for the workplace itself, but for me.
		I want to actually be worthwhile as a leader, and not just be a screw-up that the place would be better off without.
	</p>
	<p>
		And head manager, if you&apos;re reading this, I&apos;m sorry.
		I didn&apos;t mean to make you come into work on your day off.
		I know I complain about you sometimes, but I really wasn&apos;t trying to hurt you, or in fact involve you in the prank at all.
		I know you&apos;re not the type to enjoy pranks, as you&apos;ve confirmed yourself.
