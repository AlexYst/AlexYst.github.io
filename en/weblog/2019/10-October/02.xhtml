	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		I figured I should get out today.
		I haven&apos;t missed a day yet, since I set that goal of biking for at least twenty minutes each day.
		It took me a bit to figure out what to go <strong>*do*</strong>, but I eventually went out to return redeemable bottles for deposit and do a little grocery shopping.

	<p>
		Today, I really didn&apos;t want to bother with that stupid line I dug in the sand yesterday.
		I realised something about the new line I wanted to draw though: it follows next to the line of the dam.
		The line I wanted to dig marked the furthest the water can travel, and the dam is only there to make it look natural that the water stops.
		I don&apos;t need any snow for the dam.
		So I dug the spot for the dam and filled it with the dam itself.
		On one side of the dam, I filled in the line I dug yesterday with sand, undoing that part of yesterday&apos;s mistake, and on the other side, I ignored part of it and finished the other part with snow.
		I built out the bridge over to the mountain and dug the tunnel there, though I haven&apos;t built the walls of the tunnel yet.
		I&apos;ve started work on the bridge on the other side of the tunnel, so I can have an easier time getting the tunnel itself right.
		Once the tunnel is better defined, I need to start my mine there, so I need to decide what the entrance should look like.
	</p>
	<p>
		I set up a platform off the side of the one with my chest and furnace for housing the elemental crystals.
		After I built it, I sort of wished I&apos;d waited until I could build it out of stone or silver sandstone, but later decided I&apos;d done the right thing.
		This is the sort of early area in which my infrastructure is all wooden because wood is all I&apos;ve got.
		I don&apos;t have the stone to spare just yet.
		I will soon enough, but having a place for the crystals isn&apos;t something I&apos;d like to hold off on.

	<h2>Taxes</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the state of Oregon has decided I owed them more for last year&apos;s taxes, so now they&apos;re charging me.
		I don&apos;t mind getting charged the difference, but the annoying part though is that they&apos;re also retroactively charging me interest, as if I hadn&apos;t paid before but somehow could have known they were going to do this.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to pay online, but the site demands I enter the telephone number I used on my return for &quot;verification&quot;.
		I didn&apos;t include a telephone number though.
		There is absolutely no reason I would <strong>*ever*</strong> include a telephone number on a tax return.
		If the government doesn&apos;t want to take my tax money without the inclusion of a telephone number with my return, they&apos;re the ones that lose out, not me.
		Seriously.
		And they can try to come after me legally, but if they&apos;re literally not letting me file my tax return just because I don&apos;t have telephone service, they&apos;re seriously not going to have a leg to stand on in court.
		I&apos;d hire a lawyer, who would explain how I tried to file and the system wouldn&apos;t let me, and ...
		Well, I don&apos;t know what would happen after that, but I can&apos;t be in trouble for not paying taxes that I tried to pay and the government wouldn&apos;t let me.
		But while our government is pretty terrible, they&apos;re not idiotic enough to set up such a system in which they don&apos;t let citizens pay their taxes.
		So such a problem would never occur.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got into a bit of a bind this year, if I recall.
		I didn&apos;t have time to run from tax-filing service to tax-filing service, and the government here doesn&apos;t allow you to file your taxes online directly, likely because politicians took bribes from tax-prepatarion services to require taxes be prepared through a company in order to be filed electronically.
		Normally, to try several services until I find one that doesn&apos;t demand a telephone number, which is particularly annoying because they only tell you they won&apos;t file your taxes without a telephone number <strong>*after*</strong> you&apos;ve entered all your information, so I end up having to enter the same information into fifteen different websites.
		This year though, if I&apos;m remembering the correct year, I didn&apos;t have time for that garbage,  and instead entered a bogus number into the preparation service I used.
		While I was writing this entry up though, I remembered that, and thought the bogus telephone number had gotten sent to the government.
		I double-checked my tax return documents though, and it had not.
		No telephone number in sight; all telephone-related fields were blank.
		When I&apos;d initially skipped that field online, that caused it to be left off the forms, then the later field that demanded a number only sent the number to the tax-reparation company.
		They&apos;re the ones demanding it, not the government, so they deserve bogus data to work with.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I was going to write an email to the Department of Revenue&apos;s support team, as the email address is provided in the letter I received, but decided I wanted to be able to say in my journal that I&apos;d tried the form and it really was as bad as it looked, so I tried the form again.
		I tried entering nothing in the telephone number field.
		It didn&apos;t like that.
		I tried entering &quot;no telephone service&quot;.
		JavaScript on the page wouldn&apos;t allow the entry of non-numeric characters.
		Rather than disable JavaScript, I tried entering &quot;0000000000&quot;.
		Surprisingly, that worked.
		Okay, fine.
		So the form works, though it tries to trick you into providing an actual telephone number, which is still not okay in my book.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, there were two forms I could work with.
		The first was to take money directly out of my chequing or savings account.
		I looked at that form to verify that it had the &quot;required telephone number&quot; field, but did nothing else with that form.
		I don&apos;t allow people to take money directly out of my accounts unless they&apos;re my credit card companies, with <strong>*exceedingly*</strong> few exceptions.
		I just don&apos;t feel comfortable with that.
		The other form instead charged a credit or debit card.
		That was the form I worked with above, and I assume the telephone number field mechanics were the same between them.
		The credit card form&apos;s description said that a fee might be charged to the card, but that they wouldn&apos;t tell me what the fee was, or even if there would be one, until I&apos;d entered all the required information.
		When I entered the information, they told me there&apos;s be a fee of $13.86 for paying by credit card, so I cancelled the transaction, which they&apos;d specifically said before I&apos;s started was something I could do after seeing the fee and before finalising the transaction.
		I don&apos;t think they were trying to be underhanded, they just built their system n such a janky way that they can&apos;t figure out the fee until I&apos;ve entered all my information.
		It&apos;ll cost less than $13.86 to buy a stamp and mail them a cashier&apos;s cheque though.
		And after they&apos;re charging me interest and trying to charge me a service fee for paying by credit card, I&apos;m not really feeling like it&apos;s worth it to pay extra just so they can get the money quicker.
		It&apos;s no skin off my nose if they have to wait for it to arrive in the mail.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s been a week, but I&apos;m still not fully better yet.
		I probably shouldn&apos;t go to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting tomorrow.
		Instead, I&apos;ll probably stop by the credit union to get the cheque, then the post office to mail it.
