	<h2>Computer specs</h2>
	<p>
		After finishing up last night&apos;s journal entry, which dragged on after midnight due to my late-night delivery leaving me little time afterwards in which to report on how it went, I checked the advert from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> again.
		I noticed a few more things, now that I had time to actually sit down and read it more thoroughly and investigate what it was offering.
		First, it&apos;s only ten dollars per month before tax.
		I&apos;m not sure how much tax would be, but that&apos;s cheaper than I&apos;d thought they were offering.
		I thought they were charging thirty dollars before tax, or maybe thirty-five.
		For ten dollars a month, I&apos;m not sure how much longer I should put this off.
		I decided to try applying today.
		It&apos;s an incredibly good deal.
		At least, assuming I can find a way to deal with the lack of a static <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, as it seems this <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> has started using dynamic <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses for customers that don&apos;t specifically pay more to get static ones.
		And renting a static <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address is only available to business-tier customers, I&apos;m pretty sure.
		Second, there&apos;s no contract.
		Normally, they charge you an arm and a leg for being off-contract, but with this program, they don&apos;t.
		And finally, they offer you 40 one-hours sessions on their shared hotspots every thirty days.
		I&apos;m pretty sure they allow their regular customers unlimited access to the shared hotspots.
		The shared hotspots are also paid for by the customers that host them, not by the customers using them, so when you rent a Wi-Fi router from this company, you&apos;re paying to allow other customers to use your connection, which you&apos;re also paying for.
		I prefer open Wi-Fi, so I have no problem opening up my connection, but the catch here is that your connection is only opened up to other customers of this <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>.
		They&apos;re having you pay for a perk to keep other customers as customers.
		Not cool.
		But The <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> is being stingy here, only allowing the low-rate subscribers to use the hotspots for forty hours or forty times, whichever is less usage.
		At least, I assume you can string together multiple one-hour sessions for a longer session if you choose to.
		I don&apos;t know that for sure.
		All of that&apos;s irrelevant to me though.
		They use captive portals, which means that a securely-configured firewall such as my own isn&apos;t going to allow me to sign into their Wi-Fi hotspots, so I&apos;d be using exactly zero of those sessions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I checked out their website.
		Maybe the website the instructions said to visit for registration would also give me the information on the computers that the advert said I could only get after becoming a customer.
		It was a long shot, but I figured it couldn&apos;t hurt.
		Surprisingly, everything specific (or what seems to be everything specific) about the machines is listed on the website.
		It seems these are refurbished machines, not new machines, and specific minimum specifications are provided.
		It&apos;s specifically stated thought that the machines might not exactly match this, but that they&apos;ll meet at least these minimums.
		That means I have no way to look up what hardware is included, and see if Debian will run on it before choosing which to get (or whether to get one at all).
		I also noticed that the screen size was listed for the desktop machines.
		Um.
		What?
		Those don&apos;t have built-in screens.
		Upon closer inspection, it seems the $150 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> price tag includes &quot;all&quot the required hardware to make the thing function.
		I&apos;m not sure what 7quot;all&quot; means to them, but I assume it includes a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and some cables in the case of the desktop machines.
		Mostly, the desktop and laptop options have the same specs, aside from a larger monitor for desktops, a different processor of each, a lack of Wi-Fi card on the desktop, and a lack of <abbr title="digital versatile disc">DVD</abbr> drive on the laptop.
	</p>
	<p>
		The registration form wouldn&apos;t accept that I don&apos;t have a telephone number.
		It wouldn&apos;t let me leave it blank, nor would it let me zero it out.
		So I used my usual bogus number, <a href="tel:+15555550101">+15555550101</a>.
		Come to think of it, that&apos;s too easy to track.
		I should write a short script to provide random fake numbers for me, in the form &quot;+1XXX55501XX&quot;, so I can quickly make up numbers that aren&apos;t assigned to any actual subscribers.
		Anyway, my usual bogus number was accepted by the form, but we&apos;ll see later if their system is bad enough that not being reachable via telephone interferes with their process.
		Annoyingly, it also wouldn&apos;t accept my address, saying I needed to specify my address components in exactly the order I was already specifying them.
		I made a guess as to the problem, based on the sample text shown in the input field when it&apos;s empty: it wanted me to abbreviate everything.
		I abriviated the words &quot;apartment&quot; and &quot;Oregon&quot;, and it finally accepted my address.
		That&apos;s ridiculous.
		First of all, it&apos;s stupid it won&apos;t accept people actually writing out their words.
		Secondly, it has to be poorly programmed to claim the issue is the order of the address components when it&apos;s just not allowing words to be spelled fully and correctly.
		I happened to guess what it was after, but not everyone would take the time to figure it out instead of trying to complain to the support team instead, especially because I got the hint from the filler text.
		That text isn&apos;t visible after you enter your address; that is, when the website is presenting the error message.
	</p>
	<p>
		After submitting this form, which was the first of a few, the site freaked out, gave me an unspecific error message, and wiped the form on me.
		I tried starting again, but it told me there was already an application with my telephone number.
		Y&apos;know, the bogus one.
		I tried claiming to be returning to fill out an application I&apos;d saved, and this time, it let me finish the application process.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was told it&apos;ll be a three-business-day wait for a response.
		That&apos;s fine.
		In the mean time though, I&apos;ve been working on organising things around my apartment.
		There&apos;s no self-install option for this service tier.
		For regular customers y&apos;know, the ones the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> rips off with their ridiculous prices, plethora of fees, and noxious service contracts - there&apos;s a fee for having a tech come install your modem, so there&apos;s a self-install option to get around that fee.
		With the gratis tech installation that comes with this tier, they seem to think that everyone wants the tech to come do it; that there are <strong>*no*</strong> other reasons to want to do it yourself, such as not wanting strangers coming into your home or not having the place very well organised at the moment.
		And With Summer&apos;s boxes inhabiting my living room, there&apos;s not enough space left for me to keep things organised.
		I can get things temporarily looking better before the tech drops by though.
		I didn&apos;t finish before going to bed, and didn&apos;t finish between getting up and going to work, nor did I even work on it when I got home from work.
		I&apos;ll have at least some semblance of organisation by the time the tech drops by though.
		Assuming I even get approved for service.

	<p>
		I played a bit of Minetest, just to say I did.
		I left off in the cobble mine last time, so I just mined a few ores and shut the game back off.
		I think this particular cave isn&apos;t deep enough for mese, but I&apos;m systematically revisiting the cares I passed through and cleaning them out.
		I was in a bit of a rush to get down deep when I first passed through, not to mention that I was trying to get by on just a single set of torches.

	<h2>Honorifics</h2>
	<p>
		I received a letter from American Express today.
		I found it as I was headed out to work.
		They addressed the letter to &quot;Mr. Alex Yst&quot;, which pissed me off, and when I opened the letter, I found it made out to &quot;Mr. Yst&quot; inside.
		There&apos;s absolutely no reason for them to assume my gender and add an honorific.
		They never even asked me.
		I&apos;ve written a letter in response, which I&apos;ll send along with their original letter back to them tomorrow, when the post office is open:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello American Express,
		</p>
		<p>
			I received a letter from you today addressing me as &quot;Mr. Alex Yst&quot;.
			I&apos;m not a man, and it&apos;s *incredibly rude* to call me a &quot;Mr.&quot;.
			&quot;Alex&quot; can be a man&apos;s name (short for &quot;Alexander&quot;), but it can also be a woman&apos;s name (short for &quot;Alexandra&quot;, &quot;Alexandria&quot;, &quot;Alexa&quot;, or &quot;Alexia&quot;) or even a gender-neutral name (short for &quot;Alexis&quot;).
			In my case though, I&apos;m just &quot;Alex&quot;, a name typically used as a nickname by men and women alike.
			The state of Oregon recognises me as non-binary, meaning that the correct honorific isn&apos;t &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, or &quot;Miss&quot;, but instead &quot;Mx.&quot;.
			I&apos;ve enclosed a copy of my state-issued ID so you can verify that I&apos;m not a man.
			Note the &quot;sex&quot; designation is &quot;X&quot; (non-binary), not &quot;M&quot; (male) or &quot;F&quot; (female).
			Please update your records.
			It is *highly insulting* for you to insinuate that I&apos;m a man by calling me a mister.
			If your system can&apos;t handle the &quot;Mx.&quot; honorific, that&apos;s fine.
			Just leave off the &quot;Mr.&quot;.
			That&apos;s all I&apos;m asking for.
			There&apos;s absolutely *no* reason to call me &quot;Mr. Alex Yst&quot; when you can just call me &quot;Alex Yst&quot; instead, or even just &quot;Alex&quot;.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
			~ Mx. Alex Yst
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		The worst part is that they&apos;re trying to be polite.
		In most people&apos;s minds, the polite thing to do is assume someone&apos;s gender, then call them things that assert that gender.
		The only way we&apos;re going to fix that flawed mindset is if enough people complain to those doing it until they knock it off.
		It&apos;s bad enough when individuals make such assumptions.
		There&apos;s absolutely no excuse for companies to be doing that though; not if they want your business.

	<h2>Management</h2>
	<p>
		customer claims to have gotten confirmation and money was taken from account
		tried to blame us, but either they didn&apos;t confirm or corporate messed up
		kept saying it didn&apos;t make sense that that we wouldn&apos;t have control over our website, had to keep telling them we&apos;re not corporate, we&apos;re a franchise, and it&apos;s not our website, it&apos;s theirs
		nothing I can do
		my guess is they didn&apos;t finalise and didn&apos;t actually get confirmation - that&apos;s what usually happens
