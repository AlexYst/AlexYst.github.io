<section id="brownies">
	<h2>Baking brownies</h2>
	<p>
		I really didn&apos;t plan my brownie-baking plan well.
		I hadn&apos;t even considered the possibility that I might be out of one of the ingredients, and that I should make a list of what I didn&apos;t have enough of to bring to work yesterday and go shopping after work.
		When I went over my recipe this morning, I thought I was out of vanilla extract.
		It turns out I had a gram over what I needed though, and I threw in the extra gram just to not store so little in the bottle.
		Now I&apos;m out though.
		I also thought I didn&apos;t have enough sugar when I went to weigh that out.
		It turns out I just didn&apos;t have enough of the unrefined sugar I&apos;ve been using.
		I don&apos;t use that because I like it better or something, but because I got it from the giveaway table in the laundry room, and I might as well use what I&apos;ve got.
		I had some coconut sugar to finish off my sugar quota though, another item snagged from the laundry room.
		Everything was fine this time, but I really need to plan better in the future.
		It&apos;s not like I could just go grab the items I need really quickly, as I had to wait at home for the package.
		Waiting at home for the package was pretty much my only responsibility for the day, aside from the brownie-baking and my day job.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried baking the brownies most of the way, then adding the chocolate bits on top and finishing the baking.
		I think that might have been the wrong way to go about it though.
		Instead, perhaps I should have put the chocolate on top of the batter before baking.
		I was worried the chocolate bits would sink or mix with the batter that way, but when you bake first, the batter rises unevenly, creating a bulge in the middle, which isn&apos;t something you normally see on brownies.
		The chocolate layer didn&apos;t melt in time, either.
		I thought it&apos;d melt much faster.
		I ended up having to bake them quite a bit longer.
		I ended up baking them so long that there was no way I could use them as a gift, but I had to keep going, to know if the chocolate even <strong>*would*</strong> melt.
		There was no point in doing this again if the chocolate wasn&apos;t going to melt.
		It got to a point though where the chocolate was burning.
		It refused to melt, but it was burning.
		Clearly, I couldn&apos;t just melt chocolate chunks on top to get the brownie chocolate layer.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to Web search the issue, but got nowhere.
		I then turned to <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> and tried to find a baking channel in three different places.
		None of these three channels existed, but I noticed that my client automatically joined a vegan channel I have it set to join when I opened the client.
		My brownie recipe is vegan, and one legitimate fear I had was it was the type of chocolate that was the issue.
		Is is milk chocolate, and not dark chocolate, that melts like that?
		So I framed the question that way, and asked on that channel.
		It turns out there&apos;s a bizarre secret to melting the chocolate, and it doesn&apos;t apply specifically to milk chocolate.
		I&apos;ve got to put water in a pan, put a glass bowel on top of that with the chocolate in it, and boil the water underneath.
		Somehow, this melts the chocolate instead of burning it.
		That&apos;s what I&apos;m going to need to do next time.
		I need to buy more sugar (I don&apos;t think there&apos;s enough coconut sugar left, I didn&apos;t have much of it), more vanilla extract, and more chocolate.
		Hopefully this time, it works out better.

<section id="IRA">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		The financial consultant finally got back to me.
		They say my account is still on file and the partnership hasn&apos;t ended with the investment firm, but that somehow, my legal name change mucked something up.
		I think I tried to access the account before the name change, but I don&apos;t really remember for sure.
		And the teller I spoke with specifically told me that the partnership with the investment firm had ended, so someone here (probably the teller, as part of the financial consultant&apos;s job is to know what&apos;s going on with the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> options) is clearly out of the loop.
		They said they need to verify my identity via telephone before they&apos;ll do anything about the problem though, and they want to pass sensitive information.
		Ugh.
		Not this again.
		Telephone lines aren&apos;t secure, anyway.
		Even if I had telephone service, telling someone identity-verifying information over the telephone would be dangerous.
		So I wrote back:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hey <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			That&apos;s odd.
			The person I spoke with months ago claimed the partnership had ended.
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, I don&apos;t have telephone service and cannot place any calls.
			Besides, telephone lines are not secure, and I&apos;d rather not have you give me sensitive information via telephone.
			Is there another way to fix the problem and/or verify my identity?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
			~ Alex Yst

	</blockquote>
	<p>
		They wrote back, offering me an in-person appointment, which is what I&apos;d asked for when I first wrote to them.
		They gave me three appointment slot options, saying that if none worked, we could set something up for next week.
		The first option was tomorrow as 10:00.
		I&apos;d love to take that.
		We could get this done really quickly.
		But I can&apos;t.
		I have an appointment with the dietitian in Eugene that day, and it supposedly will end at 09:30, half an hour prior.
		It could run late, not to mention that it&apos;ll likely take me about half an hour to get home, and depending on how I&apos;m feeling, could take even longer.
		And then the credit union is even further from the hospital than my apartment is, so it&apos;d take even longer to get there.
		That just isn&apos;t a viable option this week.
		The other two appointment slots were at 10:30 and 15:00 on Thursday.
		I don&apos;t have anything in my planner that conflicts with either of these times, so unless I&apos;ve forgotten to write something down in my exhaustion (which I&apos;m going to end up missing anyway because I&apos;ve forgotten it), either time will work.
		The can openers are supposed to arrive at some point that day, and I have the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting in the evening, but nothing&apos;s keeping me away during these times.
		I went with the 10:30 appointment, so as to get it done as early as feasible.

<section id="ISP">
	<h2>Package from the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I planned to wait in the entryway for the package, sitting on the chair by the table.
		Scrap bikes are in the way though, as I moved them there while I was cleaning to get them out of the way, and I&apos;ve been roaming the apartment taking care of other things.
		When working on my laptop, I&apos;ve been in the bedroom, which was the absolute worst place for me to be.
		I&apos;d be least likely to hear the door if someone tried knocking, and I don&apos;t have my &quot;I&apos;m half deaf, please don&apos;t knock, ring the doorbell&quot; sign built yet.
		I&apos;ve been planning that for a few months, but haven&apos;t done anything about it yet.
		Thankfully, while I was in the bedroom when the deliveryperson arrived, they rang the doorbell, so I darted to the door.
		(Why do some people try knocking instead except when a sign tells them to do otherwise, anyway?
		That&apos;s what doorbells are for.)
		They tried to hand me the package, and I said that before they gave it to me, I needed to ask if there was a return to sender option.
		I said I&apos;d take it and return it myself if there wasn&apos;t such an option, but that I had to ask.
		They telephoned someone, I think their supervisor, and asked about it.
		The person on the line walked them through it, having them file it as a refused package on their little device thing they scan the packages with.
		Sweet.
		That&apos;ll save me a trip.
		I honestly believed I would <strong>*have*</strong> to return it in person, but my trying to get out of it paid off.
		Also, I now know that I can simply refuse packages that are delivered through this company, provided I&apos;m there to refuse them, so they don&apos;t just get dropped at my door.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got home, I found an email notification alerting me that the package would be delivered tomorrow.
		That worried me, as I wouldn&apos;t be home tomorrow to decline it again.
		I checked with the tracking site though, and it clearly says the package is being returned to the sender.
		So the package will be returned to the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> tomorrow.
		Nice.
		That was quick.
