<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I&apos;d come across a large building with multiple stories and an epic overhang.
		I tried to get a photograph of it, but a storage shed was in the way in just the wrong angle, so I couldn&apos;t get a good shot of it.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="gaff">
	<h2>Gaff</h2>
	<p>
		I tried out the Gaff while running my Tuesday errands.
		I didn&apos;t expect any issues, and figured I&apos;d wear it both during my errands and at work.
		However, I found I hadn&apos;t even travelled far enough to get off my block, and things were shifting out of place.
		I&apos;m not sure what to do about this.
		I don&apos;t have time to walk everywhere just to keep my gaff in place!
		Am I using it incorrectly?
		Is there a way to make the gaff hold?
		I was certainly right to buy just one.
		If I can&apos;t figure out how to make these things work, I don&apos;t need a whole pile of them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried wearing it all day at work, too.
		Normally, I don&apos;t have access to a restroom when I go out, because gender-neutral restrooms aren&apos;t available.
		However, the women&apos;s restroom at work is used for storage, and everyone, regardless of gender, uses the men&apos;s, making it effectively a gender-neutral restroom.
		So I got to work, went to the restroom, and adjusted the gaff back into place.
		It didn&apos;t even last the two hours until my first break though.
		I tucked again on that break, and it didn&apos;t last the three hours until my next break.
		I tried again, and that didn&apos;t last the two hours until closing time.
		This thing really isn&apos;t holding.
		I&apos;ve got to be doing something wrong.
		I need to look up instructions, I guess.
	</p>

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		My academic advisor wrote back to me saying the tech team isn&apos;t going to do anything about the <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> wall issue.
		Honestly, I didn&apos;t think the would, seeing as they have a history of not fixing the technical problems I bring up to them.
		I don&apos;t recall a single problem I&apos;ve brought up that they&apos;ve ever actually fixed.
		The important thing here to me though is that I tried.
		Again.
		Even if in vain, this attempt means that I&apos;m not going to sit and build my frustration throughout the coming term until I finally blow up at the school.
		I mean, my frustration is still going to build, but I&apos;ve already done all I can, as far as contacting the school is concerned.
	</p>

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		<del>It&apos;s Tuesday again, so I took care of my home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment.
		If I&apos;d know the university was going to pull their garbage and I wasn&apos;t going to be able to attend class this term, I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve scheduled these treatments for Tuesdays.
		It&apos;s a bit late to change the treatment day now though, as I&apos;m not sure how close they have to be to being a week apart.</del>
	</p>
	<p>
		<ins>Oops.
		I was doing the treatments on Tuesdays and Saturdays when I had two treatments per week, and for some reason, I thought that when I hit the once-per-week phase, I&apos;d dropped the Saturday treatments.
		I looked at my calendar later though, and noticed it was actually the Tuesday treatments I&apos;d dropped.
		Hopefully the timing isn&apos;t incredibly important, as I accidentally did this week&apos;s treatment <strong>*way*</strong> early.</ins>
		I should have known that I would have dropped the Tuesday treatments because of my Tuesday errands occurring on that day, with Saturdays having plenty of time to spare for treatments.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/10/08.png" alt="A path of pine needles, used as scaffolding while I work under the bridge" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		Again, my goal for the day was just to gather a bunch of pine needles for grinding while I did other things; in today&apos;s case, while working on my home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="IRA">
	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> account</h2>
	<p>
		I tried setting up an account to manage my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> online, finally.
		At first, I thought it&apos;d be easier than I&apos;d feared.
		On the registration form, there&apos;s the option to add existing accounts to the online profile.
		Honestly, my biggest fear was that because I already had an account, trying to register through the website would create a separate account, and that the actual thing I needed to do was contact support, which is a a bit of a pain, seeing as they only seem to want to handle account-related matters via post, which is not only slow in that it needs to be delivered, but also slow in that it means I need to go find a place to print out my letters to them and take them into the post office to buy stamps for them.
		What a pain.
		But the registration form seemed to indicate that I wouldn&apos;t need to bother with any of that.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, every time I try to register, I&apos;m presented with an error message with no specific error given, and told that trying again usually works.
		I tried again several times though, to no avail.
		So I emailed them:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello Shareholder Services,
		</p>
		<p>
			Years ago, I set up an investment account with your company through my credit union.
			Unfortunately, my credit union no longer has a partnership with your company, so I&apos;ve lost access to my [company name] account.
			Today, I tried setting up a profile online, so I could regain access to the account and start depositing again, but your website gives me a vague error message: &quot;We&apos;re sorry, we couldn&apos;t complete the action you requested.&quot;.
			I tried a few more times, and always got the same error message.
			How do I set up my online profile so I can regain access to my account?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
			~ Alex Yst
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		They wrote back telling me to follow a chain of links they provided to get to the registration form - the same registration form I&apos;d been using - and follow the instructions provided there.
		Gee, that&apos;s helpful.
		Clearly, I&apos;ve already found the registration form if the registration form is giving me an error message when I submit it.
		They also recommended I try again, and if I continued to have problems, I call some telephone number.
		No.
		We&apos;re not doing this via telephone.
		Besides, I don&apos;t even have telephone service.
		I tried again though, and the website sent me the same error message in return.
		So I replied:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello Shareholder Services,
		</p>
		<p>
			I don&apos;t have telephone service and cannot call any numbers.
			I followed the instructions you provided though, and the website continues to give me that error message.
			How do I get help with the problem?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>

<section id="swimming">
	<h2>Swimming lessons</h2>
	<p>
		My workmate offered another swimming lesson tomorrow.
		I was actually looking forward to using tomorrow productively, but beggars can&apos;t be choosers.
		I also figured that on such short notice, I wouldn&apos;t get much sleep.
		I had to get laundry done, so I&apos;d have my one and only gaff clean and ready for when I&apos;m in a swimsuit and need it most, right?
		This was before I found my gaff slipping at work though.
		This isn&apos;t going to hold until I learn to use it properly, so I need to go back to using the jockstrap for that day.
		I&apos;ll use the small, unmodified one, but with underwear under it this time, and see how that works out.
		I still had to stay up late to do a full-body shave, which I would have done last night or the night before, had I known I&apos;d be half-naked at the pool tomorrow, but that didn&apos;t take as long as laundry would have.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, my workmate called me a &quot;he&quot; to a customer, showing they still think of me as a man, which is disappointing.
		I thought this was one of the few people that actually saw me for what I am.
		I didn&apos;t say anything, but after the customer left, they apologised for not calling me an &quot;it&quot;.
		I&apos;d rather be called an &quot;it&quot; than a &quot;he&quot;, but the polite word would instead be &quot;they&quot;.
