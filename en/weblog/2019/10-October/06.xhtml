	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		This school just gets worse and worse.
		Now they&apos;ve put their course registration interface behind one of those obnoxious CloudFlare <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> walls.
		I&apos;d write to them and complain if I thought it&apos;d do any good, but I know it won&apos;t.
		Out of morbid curiosity, I tried loading the main classroom website.
		Sure enough, that thing&apos;s got a CloudFlare <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> wall now too.
		This really is no way to treat their students.
		I might complain about that one, seeing as I&apos;m likely going to have to be dealing with it every single day while school is in session.
		If I don&apos;t complain right off the bat, the <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> wall will wear me down until I <strong>*do*</strong>.
		Y&apos;know what?
		It&apos;s better to complain now.
		I wrote the following letter to my academic advisor, knowing that if I tried to write to the tech team, my advisor would intercept it anyway as if it was a letter meant for them:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			I went to register for courses for the coming term, and found that both the student portal website and the main classroom website are now blocked by obnoxious CloudFlare CAPTCHA walls. If this isn&apos;t fixed, I&apos;m probably going to have to complete multiple CAPTCHAs each day while school is in session just to access the course material, which needless to say, is going to waste a sizable amount of my time, not to mention that it&apos;s going to get really tiring really fast. As you already know, I&apos;m already pretty ticked off with all the garbage the school has been throwing at me over the past year or so, and adding these daily CAPTCHAs to the mix really isn&apos;t going to improve my opinion of this school.
		</p>
		<p>
			My guess is that the tech team isn&apos;t going to care, as they&apos;ve done nothing about technical issues I&apos;ve brought to their attention in the past. It&apos;s probably been over a year since I&apos;ve been able to use the school&apos;s on-site messaging system, for example, and no apparent fix is in the works. However, could you please at least let them know about the problem just in case they choose to actually do something about it this time?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>

		I got a really bad feeling as I was writing the letter too, and tried an experiment on a hunch.
		It seems that if you disable JavaScript, Google (who provides CloudFlare&apos;s <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>s) will acknowledge you as human after filling out several <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>s, but CloudFlare will refuse to accept the code Google gives you, and will just send you another <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> wall.
		That means I&apos;m going to have to enable JavaScript to get past these infuriating <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> walls, then once past them, disable it again because having JavaScript enabled on the school&apos;s website causes bad things to happen, such as page freezes and lost coursework submissions.
		What an absolute pain in the rear.
		The school wasn&apos;t being enough of a pain, so they decided they needed to make their site even more obnoxious and cumbersome to work with.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I got registered for courses for the coming term.

	<h2>Groceries</h2>
	<p>
		I forgot I needed cilantro for the salad, so I didn&apos;t pick that up yesterday after work.
		I had to head back to the grocery store for that, taking up what little time I had to spare.
		What did I say yesterday?
		I said today wouldn&apos;t be productive, as I&apos;d be busy putting together that salad.

	<p>
		I spent a bit of time harvesting trees and using the snow to replace the edging of the bridge, though my actual intent today was to gather pine needles to have the game grind for me while I got other things done, such as prepare the salad and go grocery shopping.
		I haven&apos;t made much actual progress in the game world today though, and didn&apos;t really intend to.

<section id="work">
	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		We had a new employee join us today.
		between their face and they&apos;re general demeanour, I&apos;m convinced they&apos;re someone I&apos;ve worked with in the past, and their name seems familiar as well.
		They recognised me too, bu they said I looked like an &quot;Andrew&quot; they&apos;d worked with here six years ago.
		I don&apos;t remember an &quot;Andrew&quot;, but they might be mixing up names, and might actually remember my face.
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager thought they figured out why our stupid computer system keeps going down.
		The soda cooler up front started leaking, so they pulled out the nearby table to clean up the slipping hazard.
		The system went down on us.
		They got the system back up, supposedly by resetting a specific circuit breaker.
		But then they pushed the table back in, having finished with the spill, and they system want back down.
		This time, toggling the breaker back and forth didn&apos;t fix the issue.
		I&apos;m pretty sure they&apos;re right about the problem&apos;s trigger.
		They bumped something when moving the table.
		Either Windows isn&apos;t recovering from that properly (it&apos;s set to restart after power failure, it seems, based on past dealings with the issue and what a former shift leader said about what they saw when they plugged a monitor into the on-site server), or the power was cut, not toggled.
		Some connection wasn&apos;t tight enough, and came loose.
		If that&apos;s the case, as much as I&apos;d love to blame Windows, it&apos;s actually a hardware issue.
		<del>I don&apos;t think the head manger is right about the <strong>*solution&apos;s*</strong> trigger though.</del>
		They tried it several more times, to no avail, but also, several forced power cycles like that shouldn&apos;t fix anything, as far as I&apos;m aware.
		<ins>Actually, it turns out I misunderstood the situation.
		When the system went down, the breaker was tripped.
		Therefore, the tripped breaker is what took down the system.
		However, the second time it happened today, the system didn&apos;t come back online when they reset the breaker.
		They kept trying the breaker, so I thought they were toggling it back and forth each time, but I don&apos;t actually know what it is they were doing.
		The tripped breaker was definitely the issue.
		We&apos;re not sure why moving the table trips the breaker though.
		I worry we have a short somewhere over there, and moving the table is grounding something that shouldn&apos;t be grounded.
		I told the head manager that when they asked if I had any ideas why moving the table would trip the breaker, and brought up the fire in that same area from several years ago, but it seems the fire from last time was due to a faulty extension cord, which is no longer in use.
		Of course it&apos;s not in use though; it caught fire!
		I doubt it would have even sort of worked after that.</ins>
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager confused me as we were finishing up our closing duties.
		They gave me a fifty-dollar bill, saying it was &quot;because they like me&quot;.
		I&apos;m not sure how to interpret this.
		To start with though, I have to assume they like me as a worker, not as a person.
		If they liked me as a person, they&apos;d stop calling me manly words that they know I hate and stop referring to me as a &quot;he&quot;.
		They&apos;re not doing that to be mean, so I have to assume it&apos;s more of an apathy.
		They simply don&apos;t care about me, and to be honest, I see no reason that they should.
		They&apos;re my boss, and as far as they&apos;re concerned, I&apos;m a tool to get the job done, which again, leads me to believe this refers to liking me as a worker.
		But I didn&apos;t think they liked me as a worker.
		I guess they haven&apos;t been doing it since they first offered me the promotion, but they use to tell me off for things I couldn&apos;t help, or getting on my case about small mistakes that actually were my fault.
		They seemed to dislike me.
		Maybe they don&apos;t?
		Or maybe they don&apos;t <strong>*any more*</strong>?
		I don&apos;t know.
		Or maybe this is the bonus split they mentioned?
		Maybe they still got a small bonus, even despite all the setbacks last month, and this is my cut?
		I just don&apos;t know.
		And honestly, I&apos;m not sure I have the emotional energy to process this properly at this time.
		I&apos;m just so worn down.
		Even after taking a break from my to-do list, it&apos;s going to take a bit to process today&apos;s strangeness.
		And this is sort of low-priority, anyway.
		It&apos;s positive, not negative, which puts it mostly off my treat <abbr title="Radio Detection And Ranging">radar</abbr> and makes it something to deal with on another day.

<section id="Summer">
	<h2>Summer</h2>
	<p>
		When I got home from work, one of my neighbours informed me that Summer and Vanessa had dropped by and taken a few boxes.
		For some reason, they thought they might have been taking them to the dumpster, but they seemed unsure, so I&apos;m not sure why they thought that.
		We talked for a while, then I headed upstairs to my place.
		There, I found my door unlocked and my light on.
		She&apos;d left my door unlocked, and hadn&apos;t even bothered to turn out the light!
		I swear, I hate that she has a key to this place.
		It&apos;s just not safe for her to have one.
	</p>
	<p>
		I took a look in the dumpster later to see if the neighbour&apos;s theory was likely, but I didn&apos;t see any boxes in there.
		I&apos;m pretty sure they were just taking them with them to wherever they were going.
		Summer may have found a home; I&apos;m not sure.
		That&apos;d make more sense.
		I&apos;m not sure why she&apos;d store stuff here that she didn&apos;t want instead of throwing it out to begin with.
