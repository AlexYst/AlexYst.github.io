	<h2>Unproductivee</h2>
	<p>
		For the past couple weeks, or maybe even the past three weeks, I&apos;ve been very unproductive.
		Honestly, I needed a break.
		But now I&apos;ve had one.
		I planned to get back to working on my to-do list today, but that didn&apos;t end up happening.
		I got distracted.
		My bad.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got some grocery shopping done, but I bought ingredients for that Aztec salad.
		That&apos;s good because it&apos;s a healthy food that I really enjoy, but it&apos;s bad because it takes so long to make.
		I&apos;ll probably spend my free time tomorrow assembling the salad, so I won&apos;t get anything of note done then either.

	<p>
		I don&apos;t like how the bridge is coming out.
		This time, I didn&apos;t include snow in the design, figuring that&apos;d speed up the process of saving up snow for the island.
		I really do prefer the snow-edged bridge design though, and the bridge design has to carry on far beyond the island.
		It was short-sighted to sacrifice the bridge&apos;s design to speed progress of the island.
		So now, I&apos;m going back and replacing the wooden stairs on the bridge with snow ones, as I had in the other world.
		It&apos;s going to take longer than if I&apos;d just done it right the first time, but at least I&apos;ll have the nice bridge design before I extend the bridge even further and make even more work for myself.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I nearly forgot to get my home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment done today.
		I remembered on and off, but usually had something else to do first, such as go to work, pick up groceries, or hang my laundry.
		It was nearly time for bed by the time I actually got it done.
