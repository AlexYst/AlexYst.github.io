	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was trying to get a certificate of initiation into some cult.
		I&apos;m not sure why, as I didn&apos;t buy what the were preaching.
		All you had to do though was buy their expensive starter kit, which included their initiate robes, and participate in a welcoming ceremony.
		I think the robe was blue with fancy yellow or white trim, but the memory of what it looked like is fading quickly.
		They took tried to take me to a crowded locker room area, saying I needed to change into the robe there.
		I objected, saying there wasn&apos;t a changing area I could use there.
		They insisted, and practically dragged me while I was fumbling for my wallet to show them my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		I&apos;d show them the non-binary designation, and they wouldn&apos;t be able to claim me to be one or the other any more.
		We got to the locker room area,and they pointed the way to the men&apos;s locker rooms and the way to the women&apos;s locker rooms.
		I kept trying to tell them I&apos;m not a man or a woman, but they kept interrupting me before I could get it out.
		A friend walked by though, saw what was probably going on, and told the cult leader that unless there was a non-binary changing area, I couldn&apos;t change there.
		They ignored them and kept pushing, but I was now able t get a word in and explained that I&apos;m neither man nor woman and couldn&apos;t use either changing area.
		They didn&apos;t believe me, and my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> wasn&apos;t in my wallet for some reason.
		Luckily, they started throwing a tantrum, and I soon found out it was because their own <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, which they were trying to pull out for some counterpoint I couldn&apos;t even fathom, was also missing.
		For some reason, this meant they needed to go home, and they were pretty much in tears about it being missing, saying it wasn&apos;t fair.
		They asked me if I knew where the nearest train station was, except they called it by some company name (I don&apos;t recall the name now) that I&apos;d never heard, so it took me several moments to even know what they were asking for.
		I explained that I don&apos;t ride trains, so I have no idea where the stations are.
		They left, ostensibly to find a train station, and I was left with the robe and most of the starter kit.
		I hadn&apos;t paid yet.
		I thought that this was a golden opportunity to get the certificate that I for some reason needed without having to get ripped off by a cult I didn&apos;t even believe in.
		I thought there was another higher-up there, that with robe in hand, I could get the certificate from, explaining the situation of the cult leader having left without granting the certificate, but not explaining that I hadn&apos;t yet paid and hadn&apos;t yet con through the ceremony.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why did I want that certificate so badly though?
		That&apos;s the real question.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve finished my work at World&apos;s Navel for the time being.
		All that&apos;s left to do there is install the rails, which I don&apos;t currently have the materials for.
		I&apos;ve gone back to mining, now with many more torches, and have put temporary torches in my main mine shaft.
		It&apos;s difficult to walk at precisely the right angle to make it down the mine shaft without getting stuck on things, so having light to reorient by makes things easier.
		Once the rails are installed though, the torches won&apos;t be needed, as I won&apos;t need to see where I&apos;m going.
		The cart will just take me there, and I&apos;ll have light at the destination point.

<section id="Summer">
	<h2>Summer</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been meaning to do this for nearly a week now, but I finally got a note to Summer posted on th einside of my door for next time she drops by:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			[Summer],
		</p>
		<p>
			Please lock the door when you leave.
			On both September 17 and October 06, I came home to find the door unlocked and the neighbours saying you&apos;d been by.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I got out my paper and marker, then thought for a bit that maybe I should wait until she leaves the door unlocked a third time before leaving a coldly-worded note.
		But no, she&apos;s got  history of doing this.
		I&apos;m not sure what her problem is, but she can&apos;t figure out how to lock my door, even though she&apos;s real uptight about making sure her own is locked.
		Besides, I haven&apos;t spoken with her at all since a bit after we had our last major talk.
		That&apos;s been months.
		I think she knows I want nothing to do with her.
		Either she knows, or she herself wants nothing to do with me, seeing as she&apos;s the one avoiding me while still dropping by my place, making sure only to do it when I&apos;m gone.
		Most likely though, it&apos;s both.
		But I think it&apos;ll help it sink in a bit more to see a note addressed not to her title of &quot;Mother&quot;, but to her actual name.
		I&apos;m still angry.
		Not a week goes by that I don&apos;t find myself thinking about how pissed off I am at her on at least two or three days.
		I want her to see just a bit of that anger.
		Not a tonne.
		But I want her to see that I no longer call her &quot;Mother&quot;.

<section id="Vanessa">
	<h2>Dropping off Vanessa&apos;s birthday present</h2>
	<p>
		Vanessa&apos;s birthday is coming up.
		I bought her a gift a while back, but have been neglecting to wrap it.
		So I got it wrapped before work, hoping to deliver it after work.
		I was pretty sure Summer would be asleep by then, if she&apos;s even at the house.
		I mean, she&apos;s moving stuff out, so she may have found another place and be sleeping there instead.
		If Summer and Vanessa are elsewhere, it&apos;ll be a while before she finds the gift, but she&apos;s not responding to my emails, so I can&apos;t exactly ask her.
		On some level, I kind of wonder if Summer&apos;s responsible for Vanessa&apos;s unresponsiveness.
	</p>
	<p>
		After work, I stopped by Summer&apos;s house.
		I wasn&apos;t sure she or Vanessa would still be there, as I said, but the entryway light was still on.
		The entryway light is usually a good indicator that Vanessa&apos;s awake.
		Summer&apos;s still a pack rat.
		I arrived to find the front door blocked by a table on its side on top of some other item she&apos;s brought home.
		I didn&apos;t pay attention to what it was.
		And getting in the door was a struggle too, not to mention the hallways ans stairs were covered in her belongings.
		Before I went in though, I checked around back, to see her bedroom light was on, but dim.
		I figured that meant she was probably still awake, but in her bedroom, where I wouldn&apos;t have to see her.
	</p>
	<p>
		I quietly opened the door and went in, in case she was closer to the entryway than I was guessing (she can&apos;t hear anything at the entryway, and can&apos;t even hear the loud doorbell, from her bedroom), and headed upstairs.
		As I tried to reach the base of the stairs, Summer&apos;s cat called out to me from the top of the stairs.
		It still remembers me.
		If it didn&apos;t, it&apos;d&apos;ve fled; it fears strangers pretty badly, and panics when it sees them.
		It may have been a year since the cat and I&apos;ve seen each other, but I suppose the likelihood of the cat not recognising me would be about the same as the likelihood of me not recognising the cat.
		We spent years living together, so it should recognise me.
		Still, it surprised me to hear the cat calling me.
		To be honest, I&apos;d forgotten the cat exists, and it very well could have forgotten me too until it noticed me coming in the front door, just at the bottom of the stairs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Vanessa didn&apos;t seem to be around.
		She might have been in Summer&apos;s room with Summer, or she might not have been at home at all.
		I considered putting the gift outside her door.
		If it were me, I wouldn&apos;t want things showing up in my bedroom.
		But Summer would be more likely to notice it.
		I decided to put it on her pillow instead.
		She&apos;d see it there, and Summer probably wouldn&apos;t.
		I think she&apos;d agree with me that Summer shouldn&apos;t see it, and if I&apos;m wrong, she&apos;ll show Summer anyway.
		This way, it&apos;ll be her choice.
		And I&apos;m not sure she&apos;s as territorial about her bedroom as I am about mine, not to mention that my territorialism comes directly from how Summer has behaved regarding my bedroom my entire life.
		In fact, I don&apos;t even mind other people doing stuff in my bedroom as long as they&apos;re respectful about it, I just know that she&apos;s never been respectful about it, which is why I had to lock her out of my own room.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, my best guess is that Vanessa will find it tonight, but maybe she&apos;s not even there.
		Summer&apos;s music was audible from the entryway, so the entryway light might have been on because Summer was doing something.
		I was glad not to run into her though.
		I was still wearing my manager shirt as I&apos;d come straight from work, and she&apos;d probably recognise what it was.
		She doesn&apos;t know about the promotion, and it&apos;s none of her business.

	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I was supposed to use my hair-removal <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> today, but I mistakenly used it on Tuesday instead, so I simply didn&apos;t use it today.
		Hopefully that was the right way to deal with the mistake.

<section id="memories">
	<h2>Memories</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t have time to write much before work, aside from keeping up with today&apos;s journal entry, but I did sort out the notes related to my next topic from my other notes: how I came to be a Debian user.
		It was an interesting journey, and started out rather slow.
		It&apos;ll probably be a short page, but it&apos;ll be a fun topic to talk about.

<section id="computer">
	<h2>Strange computer offer</h2>
	<p>
		I got another advertisement from the local cable company yesterday via post.
		I could tell what it was from the envelope: they were telling me again about their affordable Internet service for poor people.
		It&apos;d be nice to be able to get my home server back online.
		I&apos;m not sure I have the time to deal with their garbage right now though.
		I took the letter to work with me, figuring I&apos;d read it on my break.
		I totally forgot though, and it came back home with me, without my even remembering I&apos;d taken it to work.
		It just stayed in my laptop bag.
		I saw it as I was getting ready for work though, and this time, I had time to take a look before I headed out, so I did.
	</p>
	<p>
		This time, they tell me that if I get their service, which is actually reasonably-priced, I can also get a new computer for $150 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		There are desktop and laptop options available (I assume only one option of each type, but that technically might not be the case), though they won&apos;t give me the details until I register for service.
		That&apos;s an awesome price for a new machine though.
		It really has me curious.
		I could use a new laptop to have another spare, for in case one dies on me.
		I mean, <a href="/en/domains/bailey.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a> has threatened to die on me at least a couple times now, and I pretty much consider it gone already, meaning I don&apos;t have a backup laptop at this time.
		It&apos;d be great to have one again.
		But at that price, I have to assume very low specs, and probably a bunch of proprietary bullshit to deal with.
		The desktop would be more likely to run Debian.
		I mean, both probably start with Windows, but if I installed Debian, the desktop&apos;s the one less likely to have issues.
		If the laptop didn&apos;t run Debian though, I might be able to make it run Ubuntu and use it as an unclean machine for school.
		Or even - <em>*shudder*</em> - leave Windows on it in case the school throws any other Windows-specific assignments at me.
		I should look into this soon, and I should see if I can find the computer specs online somehow before accepting any offers, just in case the specs can in fact be found.

<section id="EUGLUG">
	<h2>Making it to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting</h2>
	<p>
		Halloween lands on a Thursday this year, and on Halloween, everyone at my workplace works.
		It&apos;s the busiest night of the year.
		At the end of last month, when I was filling out this month&apos;s calendar, I saw when Halloween landed.
		I was disappointed, but just accept that I&apos;d miss the meeting, if there even was one.
		However, the head manager pulled me aside tonight and told me to write them a note telling when I was available that day.
		They specifically brought up my Thursday stuff, though they didn&apos;t seem to remember exactly what I had going.
		That&apos;s still pretty cool though.
		So there&apos;s a pretty decent chance I&apos;ll be able to make the meeting after all.
		That is, again, if the meeting doesn&apos;t get cancelled.
		Multiple <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> members have children, including the owner of the garage we meet in.
		Trick-or-treating plans may prevent the meeting from happening.

<section id="management">
	<h2>Management</h2>
	<p>
		For the past week or so, when I&apos;ve been doing soda counts for the nightly inventory, I&apos;ve been finding partial crates of sodas under other crates of soda.
		My guess has been that one of the new employees has been taking sodas from underneath when restocking the coolers.
		We&apos;re not allowed to do that though.
		It&apos;s too easy not to see the missing sodas when doing the counts, so only the crates on top are allowed to have missing sodas.
		All others have to be perfectly full.
		I&apos;ve noticed and replaced the sodas using ones from the top crates, but not everyone does, and I&apos;ve also been unsure of whether there are further missing ones deeper in that can&apos;t be seen.
		Ive been meaning to talk to the people working registers about the problem, as it&apos;s your job to restock your register&apos;s respective cooler when you&apos;re stationed on a register, so one of them was the likely culprit.
		I&apos;ve been too nervous to confront anyone about it though, and have been trying t work up the nerve.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, I had a passing thought that I could bring it up with the head manager.
		I could mention it offhandedly or something.
		I quickly swatted down that idea.
		The problem should remain unfixed until I stop being a coward and fix it myself.
		That drove me to confront today&apos;s cashiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to confront the drive-through person first, but they were busy.
		They were a returning employee from before, so I needed to talk to them to cover my bases, but I figured it wasn&apos;t them.
		So I confronted the front counter cashier.
		I explained that I didn&apos;t know if it was them, but I was telling everyone.
		Honestly, I thought it was them though.
		I figured if I was in that position, I&apos;d handle it better if my boss wasn&apos;t accusing me of something I hadn&apos;t done, and I didn&apos;t know for sure it was them.
		I&apos;d fixed the crates yesterday and the problem was back today, but it still could have been morning crew that messed them up again.
		As a boss, I don&apos;t even care who&apos;s doing it anyway, I just want it to stop so things will run smoothly.
		I then explained the rationale behind why we can&apos;t take from the bottom crates without replacing them.
		If I were in that position, I&apos;d be less likely to think my boss was just being arbitrary and over-controlling if they explained the reasoning to me.
		A bit later, I caught the drive-through checker, and did the same thing, except instead of saying I wasn&apos;t sure it was them, I said I didn&apos;t think it was them.
		They actually admitted to it though!
		I thought they&apos;d know better.
		No matter though.
		The problem should be solved now.
		That is, unless they&apos;re not the only one doing it.
		But yeah, it pays not to avoid talking to someone about something just because you think they&apos;re innocent if you don&apos;t actually know who did something.
		And I&apos;m glad I finally worked up the nerve to actually act.
		That&apos;s another step toward being a decent boss and a decent leader.
		When you&apos;re in charge, you can&apos;t let fear stop you from even talking to people about basic issues that can easily be fixed with a little communication.
