<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 42 grams of cereal and 93 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had 314 grams of that pizza, and another 59 grams as a snack.
		For dinner, I had a 594-gram smoothie.
		I also snacked on some potato chips at the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="GNOME">
	<h2><abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> issues</h2>
	<p>
		My plan for the day was to type up my recipes at the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr>  meeting.
		That&apos;s not what ended up happening though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, I spent al day trying to research the file-sorting issues in <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr>.
		Someone recommended I use <abbr title="K Desktop Environment">KDE</abbr> Plasma instead, which is the other desktop environment supported by the PureOS team.
		Supposedly, it offered the option to turn off that obnoxious behaviour, though it was turned on by default.
		When compiling locales didn&apos;t work, I gave Plasma a try.
		When I installed it though, I found it had decided that PCManFM was the default file manager.
		I&apos;d tried setting that as the file manager in <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr>, but to no avail.
		PureBrowser was still insisting on using Nautilus though.
		But I didn&apos;t know that until later.
		What I found though was that Plasma lacked the touchpad gestures that <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> has.
		That shouldn&apos;t matter, but this stupid laptop was built without mouse buttons, so without the gestures, you&apos;ve got no middle or right click options.
		I was at a loss as to what to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to researching the file-sorting issue.
		I&apos;m not the only person that has complained, but it seems the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> developers don&apos;t care.
		Numerous people have submitted patches for the problem, which allow users to configure <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> to sort the way we want or sort the way the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> developers want, but the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> developers always reject the patches.
		They don&apos;t want a basic character-by-character sort to even be an option.
		I ended up deciding to try to edit the source of whatever <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> library was providing this obnoxious behaviour, and recompile it.
		It&apos;s not ideal.
		I won&apos;t be able to update the library using the package manager, and when I update other packages, they may break because of the older library version before I realise I need to manually edit the source of the new version and compile again.
		But at least I&apos;d have a working machine for the most part.
		While researching, I learned that Debian 10 had been released.
		That was irrelevant at the time, but would become relevant later.
	</p>
	<p>
		After having spent all day researching, I was going to type up those recipes at the meeting.
		But I just couldn&apos;t focus on that.
		I did further research, and found the exact function that was causing all the trouble: <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code>.
		Using that name, I was able to track down the library: <code>glib</code>.
		If I could compile <code>glib</code> after removing the obnoxious behaviour from <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Unicode-Manipulation.html#g-utf8-collate-key-for-filename"><code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code></a>, I thought all applications on my system that depend on <code>glib</code> would stop this foolishness.
		And to make matters easier, a function called <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Unicode-Manipulation.html#g-utf8-collate-key"><code>g_utf8_collate_key()</code></a> was mentioned on the same <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>-discussing webpage. It has the same parameter types and return value type, but doesn&apos;t mention the obnoxious behaviour the other function&apos;s section does.
		What if I were to copy the body of this function over the body of the other function so they both did the same thing?
		Would that fix the issue?
	</p>
	<p>
		As I mentioned before, Debian 10 has been released.
		My dying laptop, <a href="/en/domains/bailey.local.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a>, is running Debian 9.
		What this means is that I&apos;ve got to wipe <code>bailey</code> and install the new system anyway.
		I can break the current system all I want to before that happens, because none of my breaks are going to matter.
		So I stated trying to perform the feat on <code>bailey</code>, with the intent of eventually using what I learned on <a href="/en/domains/taylor.local.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a>.
		I didn&apos;t manage to get the fix working, though with the help of a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BuildingTutorial">Debian package-building guide</a>, I might be able to get the fix working soon.
		I feel like I&apos;m close.
		I feel like if I skipped work tomorrow and spent all day just trying to fix this, I might be able to get it done.
		But I can&apos;t skip work, and I&apos;m also likely to spend the morning running an errand.
		I&apos;m not likely to get this done tomorrow, but maybe within the week, I&apos;ll have a fix in place.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s good that I&apos;m learning how to do this.
		Learning is good.
		But it&apos;s stupid that I&apos;m <strong>*having*</strong> to learn to do this.
		Most computer users aren&apos;t up to this sort of task, but they should be able to get their files sorted correctly regardless.
		It seems many people have complained about this problem over the years, but the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> team don&apos;t care.
		A multitude of patches have been submitted to add a configuration option to disable the feature, but they always get rejected because the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> team don&apos;t want this feature to be optional.
		They want it forced on everyone.
		It seems pretty bizarre, considering that they release their source code and allow everyone to modify it.
		They want to force users to use the software the way the developers want it used, while also not forcing users to use the software the way the developers want it used.
		What is even up with that?

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/29.png" alt="The trees outside my cabin" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I feel like I&apos;ve lost all direction in Minetest.
		I just sort of want to start over, y&apos;know?
		I don&apos;t think I got the best of starts, and as I&apos;ve changed things, it&apos;s felt like the history of that world isn&apos;t quite right.
		I think I&apos;m going to build a mod that takes out some of the features of the game I find annoying.
		Not all of them though.
		I&apos;m also going to build some sort of reward system for levelling.
		I&apos;m working toward levelling up, but for what?
		I&apos;d like that to actually be meaningful.
		Again, this would work best with a restart.
		I&apos;ll build a better sleepless Isle.
		One that&apos;s better organised, that makes better use of space, and that I won&apos;t be so eager to escape.
		One I can have fun on for the foreseeable future.
		I&apos;ve learned much from this iteration of the world, but I think it&apos;s about time to try, try again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oh, yeah, I should look into settings too, and carefully consider my options.
		For example, a few weeks ago, I thought about what it&apos;d&apos;ve been like if I&apos;d played in a world without caves.
		There&apos;d be more minerals, which would be nice, but caves are often fun to play in when you&apos;re not in a rush to get anywhere.
		The deciding factor though was that without caves, there is no lava, and stone thus becomes a finite resource.
		I&apos;d find myself always using wooden tools when possible, and that wouldn&apos;t be any fun.
