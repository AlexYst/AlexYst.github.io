<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 72 grams of cereal and 135 grams of soy milk.
		For each lunch and dinner, I had a veggie patty, tapioca cheese, and pickle sandwich with eight potato nuggets.
		I also had a 402-gram smoothie and 158 grams of pretzels.
		Finally, I had about a third of a handful of potato chips at the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, but the fact that I biked to Eugene twice today - to the dietary meeting and the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting - should more than balance that out.

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten my learning journal assignments submitted and my final exams taken, leaving me free from the university until next term.
		I&apos;ve looked at the schedule, and it seems the terms starts on the fourth of next month.
		I&apos;ve got almost three weeks off.
		It&apos;s unfortunate that I&apos;m still stuck sitting on my hands for the time being, and can&apos;t do anything particularly productive with this time, but at least I won&apos;t be dealing with the school&apos;s toxicity for a while.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="dietary">
	<h2>Dietary meeting</h2>
	<p>
		Five of us showed up today, but three of us forgot to bring our binders.
		Oddly enough, this is the first time any of us forgot the binders, and now three of us did at once.
		Unfortunately, I was one of the ones that forgot.
		I remembered before I got into the building, but but if I headed home for it, I would have been half an hour late to the meeting.
		Not worth it.
	</p>
	<p>
		This time, we introduced ourselves by telling the group one food that we have or have had on our forbidden foods list.
		The dietician&apos;s food was cheese.
		For another, it was cheesy breadsticks from this one restaurant.
		For another, it was cheese bread from the same restaurant.
		I sort of wondered if these were the same menu item, and like the idiotic customers at my workplace, one of these two people either didn&apos;t know what a cheese bread is or didn&apos;t know what breadsticks are.
		I later looked up the menu for this restaurant, and assuming the menu is complete, they don&apos;t serve breadsticks of any sort.
		I was right.
		Another participant&apos;s forbidden food was ice cream shakes, and another&apos;s was just ice cream.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, we reported on our goals, as usual.
		The person that was having trouble sleeping is getting full nights&apos; sleep now, though it&apos;s difficult and requires prescribed drugs.
		Another person is doing better about putting things down and making the effort to go to sleep; they&apos;d had a similar goal.
		One person&apos;s goal was to go to the gym more, and they failed at that.
		Another person&apos;s goal was again to quit smoking; they haven&apos;t fully quit yet, and they&apos;re still vaping.
	</p>
	<p>
		We started the lesson today with what I think was supposed to be a profound though: if you change your mindset, you change your life.
		It seemed rather obvious to me though.
		Mindset is everything.
		I mean, even if nothing else is changed whatsoever, a change of perception is going to make your life different.
		Of course, I&apos;m pretty sure this message was supposed to mean that a change in mindset will change what you do, which is also true, but the change in mindset itself is a drastic change to your life.
	</p>
	<p>
		We watched a video that had an interesting take on dieting.
		It said that dietary restrictions cause problems, as people naturally fight for their freedom.
		If you don&apos;t feel free to choose, you&apos;ll choose to break the restrictions, as doing so is the only way to assert and reclaim your freedom.
		If you tell yourself you can&apos;t eat something, you can&apos;t feel free to eat something without actually eating it.
		Instead, the video recommended that you don&apos;t make rules that you can&apos;t eat things, but instead have no restrictions, and freely choose not to eat it things you shouldn&apos;t.
		<abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr> brain studies show that the part of the brain best at controlling eating isn&apos;t used when obeying rules and commands.
		You need to embrace freedom to see the best results.
		When you know you have options, you&apos;re able to consider them, and make better choices.
		You can&apos;t be rebellious either when there&apos;s nothing to rebel against.
		On the other hand, if you don&apos;t have a sense of freedom, your priority is to feel free, not to make the right choice.
		The more freedom you have, the more self-control you can develop.
		If you&apos;re not freely choosing to eat less, it&apos;ll feel negative like a punishment.
		It was an interesting take on things, and I&apos;m going to try to put it into practice.
		I made that my new goal.
		The dietary restrictions related to veganism need to remain in place, but I&apos;m going to work on removing the other restrictions, and work on changing my mindset.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note, one person recommended putting salsa on salad instead of salad dressing.
		That sounds like it might be pretty delicious.
		A recommendation of the dietician in regards to salad dressing was to get the light dressing, not the fat-free dressing, then dilute it with things such as plain yogurt.
		Obviously, I can&apos;t eat yogurt, but it was an interesting idea none the less.
		Also, it seems the dietician is a vegetarian.
		Interesting.
		It sounds like they give that vegan dietary packet to any of their group participants if they find out those group participants are vegetarian.
		That&apos;s sort of interesting.
		Though they&apos;re not trying to promote veganism, that packet is what they find helpful for vegetarians.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hmm.
		I should pick up the ingredients for the Aztec salad from that packet after work tomorrow.
		I&apos;ve been wanting that salad for a while, but haven&apos;t had time to make it lately.
		School&apos;s out though, so I&apos;ve got more time now.
	</p>

<section id="transition">
	<h2>Transnational stuff</h2>
	<p>
		I found this morning that one of the tops I bought yesterday, the tight one I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d look good in but do, shows my nipples too much.
		The rest of my body looks fine in it, but my nipples stick out, and I don&apos;t like that.
		If I pull the top down enough, the ruffle covers them, but then too much of my chest is exposed.
		I&apos;ve got bras, but they&apos;d show through as well, which I didn&apos;t think would be any better than showing my nipples.
		I really wanted to wear this top today though, so I asked the Internet what to do.
		I&apos;m not the only person with nipples, nor am I the only one not wanting to expose them, so several good search results came up right away.
		Apparently, there are companies that make disposable, adhesive pads specifically for that purpose.
		They also make &quot;non-disposable&quot; ones, which last for several uses, but in the end are still thrown out and replaced.
		There are also some strip-like bras, called bandeaux, which seem like something I&apos;d love to have for this sort of top.
		As for quick solutions, one was to use simple bandages.
		That worked great!
		The bandages grew progressively itchier as the day went on, but it was totally worth it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The person that offered me the swimsuit brought it for me today.
		They left before we could plan an outing though, so I guess that&apos;s not going to happen.
		As for the swimsuit though, it looks great on me!
		It wasn&apos;t quite what I was intending to get, but I think I like it better.
		It&apos;s a two-piecer, though the two pieces overlap.
		The bottom doesn&apos;t stay on though.
		I need to find some way to tighten the waistband, perhaps by sewing in elastic or something, which is oddly missing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I noticed today that my voice seems to be getting deeper.
		I&apos;m not happy about that.
		I really need those trans voice lessons.
		They wouldn&apos;t make my voice any higher, but they&apos;d make my deep voice not sound so manly.
		I noticed too that my face doesn&apos;t really look good with what I&apos;ve been wearing today; both the top and the swimsuit.
		I don&apos;t think fixing my voice is going to be enough after all.
		I might need facial surgery as well before I can look decent.
		Lovely.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/15.png" alt="A path down through the water" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve decided to focus work not on Languescent Mine, but on Albert Herpin Mine.
		Instead of laying rails as I go, considering the fact that I&apos;m out of the mese I need to craft the rails from, I&apos;ll lay the rails later, once I strike mese.
		That way, I&apos;ll get down further, and I&apos;ll have this mine usable sooner.
		I managed to get a good start, but I ran into an underground lake.Building the mineshaft diagonally down through that was a bit of a pain, and drastically slowed my progress.
		I&apos;ve made it through to solid rock though, so next time I go to extend the mine, I won&apos;t have to deal with the water.
