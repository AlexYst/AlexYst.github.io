		I dreamed I lived in an alternate world, one where I was learning magic.
		Someone came up to me telling me I had a package from the normal world, that I needed to sign for it, and that they thought it was a valentine from my mother.
		I hadn&apos;t even realised it was Valentine&apos;s Day, and I also didn&apos;t want anything to do with Summer.
		I debated back and forth as to whether to sign and not take the package or not sign at all.
		They handed me a clipboard, and on the line they wanted me to sign, there was stuck a milk chocolate heart wrapped in foil like you see around Valentine&apos;s Day.
		That made me think about signing and writing a note to her on the box with the chocolate (would it even reach her though?) that she knows I can&apos;t eat milk chocolate because of the milk it contains, that she knows I don&apos;t want to hear from her, and that she knows I prefer to ignore holidays.
		I didn&apos;t get to decide what to do before the scene shifted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Others in the world I was in were talking amongst each other about boots, and how they don&apos;t borrow them and how they only buy them locally.
		I looked down, and they were wearing what looked like leather moccasins.
		Everyone was but me.
		That seemed to be what was worn in this world.
		While I was mostly dressed the same as them, I had tennis shoes from this world instead that I&apos;d brought over when I came.
		I guess I swapped out most of my wardrobe to match theirs, but didn&apos;t bother with the shoes, possibly because the shoes around here were made of animal skins and I didn&apos;t want to wear them.

<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 48 grams of cereal and 84 grams of soy milk.
		For each lunch and dinner, I had a veggie patty, tapioca cheese, and pickle sandwich with potato nuggets, fifteen for lunch and fourteen for dinner.
		I also had 169 grams of pretzels as a snack and 639 grams of soy milk to drink when I got home from work.

		I finally got around to <a href="https://redmine.replicant.us/boards/9/topics/15356">asking for advice on my <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card issues</a> on the GT-i9100.
		I don&apos;t want to downgrade the device, but if I do downgrade, the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card issues should clear right up.
		Hopefully, someone will have a better idea I can try.

		I went searching for a battery online.
		I couldn&apos;t find a single site that would actually sell to me though.
		They&apos;re all either throwing bizarre errors or outright denying me service.
		<del>I&apos;m going to have to pick up a battery locally then, which is going to be expensive.
		Ugh.
		I guess maybe I&apos;ll try to do that tomorrow.
		The battery store might be closed on weekends though, so I might wait until Monday so they&apos;ll be more likely to be open or wait until Tuesday, when I&apos;ll be in the area anyway.</del>
		<ins>I checked my email for unrelated reasons, and found that the bank notified me I&apos;ve been charged by a site that claimed there to be an error in payment processing.
		I guess I&apos;ll wait it out and see if they actually send the product.</ins>

		I&apos;m sort of regretting the name <code>alchemy</code> for my mod-in-progress.
		It seems too much like a search for gold production or immortality.
		I think chimeras are associated with alchemy, which would be perfect for the plant abominations that <code>alchemy</code> will define, but the name just isn&apos;t quite what I&apos;d like it to be.
		I think I want something closer to <code>fusion</code>, though that name is a bit too ... I don&apos;t know ... boring?
		With that in mind, I did a synonym search online, and found a much better name for the mod: <code>amalgam</code>.
		Using a process I&apos;ll call &quot;amalgamation&quot;, different elements may be combined into the abominations I&apos;ll be defining.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note, I wasn&apos;t planning to limit the number of craft items I defined because I&apos;m unaware of any hard cap on the number you can have in the game at once, but defining all the craft items I&apos;ll need individually would eat up a lot of memory.
		I think I&apos;m going to try defining only one craft item of each basic type and using colours to differentiate them.
		Nodes can only have 256 colours, chosen using a palette, but craft items are able to be set to use any of the 16 777 216 colours definable using three eight-bit colour channels.
		They can be made much more compact in their definitions, which is especially great, as these items are the most boring items as well, because they don&apos;t actually do anything on their own.
		I also didn&apos;t mention when I first realised, but the calculations I&apos;d used to find the number of chest I&apos;ll need to define didn&apos;t account for some things, and are therefore off.
		I&apos;m not going to recalculate the total number of chests I&apos;ll need to define at the moment, but for version 0.0.0 of the mod, I&apos;ll need to define 22 chests.
		Furthermore, with just how much stuff I want to pack into this thing, I think I&apos;m going to break it up into several mods and call it a modpack.
		People won&apos;t have to install every last component if they don&apos;t want to.
		The main component, <code>amalgam</code>, will be depended on by the other components though, and for technical reasons, will define all the base amalgams.
		While you can make a particular combination useless by removing the mods that define its uses, you can&apos;t remove any of the amalgams themselves without editing the source code.
		Of course, given the free license, you&apos;re more than welcome to edit the source, but it&apos;ll be more work to update your copy if you choose to update at all.
		It&apos;ll look silly at first, as each mod in the modpack will have so little functionality and should theoretically be combined into a single mod, but by the time I have all 30 elements supported that I plan to support, having the various components separated out will be obvious to most people as being a good idea.
	</p>

		I&apos;m planning the tree-based mineral-renewal mechanics at the moment.
		I&apos;d originally planned to substitute the leaves of the trees with the mineral that they renewed, but I don&apos;t think I actually want to do that.
		It&apos;d be preferable from a gameplay mechanic standpoint, but it wouldn&apos;t be very aesthetically pleasing, and I think it might look a bit lazy.
		I&apos;m probably instead going to have some sort of leaf decay mechanic that makes rotten leaves convert into the relevant minerals or something, and doesn&apos;t allow leaves without a relevant mineral to rot at all.

		I leaded both the tracking page of the seller and the tracking page of the mail-tracking-number proxy, and now it seems the tracking information is back on the seller&apos;s tracking page.
		Odd.
		Anyway, it said it&apos;d get delivered today, and it did, though without enough time for me to take a look at it before work.
		I&apos;ll read the instruction manual tomorrow and see if I can figure out how to properly use the thing.
