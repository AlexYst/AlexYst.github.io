	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was at work, and someone at the menu board didn&apos;t wait their turn, and started talking after I&apos;d told them to wait while I helped the customer ahead of them.
		They were a group of robbers though, and were threatening me through the menu board!
		I knew the protocol for dealing with robbers, which starts with giving them all the money in the register.
		Seriously, two of the questions and answers on that packet the head manager told me to learn from specifically deal with what to do in case of a robbery.
		As if save the people and give up the cash wasn&apos;t already the obvious choice.
		But here, I had a bit of a head&apos;s up, because they were idiots and tried to rob me through the menu board.
		I again told them to wait as if they were a rude customer that tried to order while I was still working with the customer ahead of them, which was believable because they <strong>*did*</strong> have a customer ahead of them in line, already at the window, and I ran to both registers, front and back, and dropped all the cash into the safe.
		When the robbers came to the window, I opened the register to show them there was no money.
		I&apos;d forgotten to drop the coins, and had only dropped the bills, but somehow, the only coins were pennies.
		Still, the robbers weren&apos;t interested in those.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought they&apos;d just go away when we didn&apos;t have what they wanted, and we could resume business.
		Not so much.
		They occupied the store for several hours, trying to find a way to get cash out of us.
		We were lucky they didn&apos;t decide to kill us over what I&apos;d done, though I&apos;d told them we had no cash because we were in the process of closing for the night.
		It was an obvious lie though, seeing as we had been taking customers through the drive-through up to that point.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the heads-up, what I should have done instead was lock down the store and called the police and the owner.
		I should have basically begun the post-robbery protocol, but due to having enough warning to lock up before the robbery instead of after, done it before handing out any money.
		With the doors locked and the metal shutter down over the drive-through window, they wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve been able to rob us through the drive-through, and would have to either go away or break in through the front, through the glass doors, in which case we would have to hand over the money anyway.
		Instead of treating this as a battle and trying to set up our physical defences, I tried to let them see we had nothing to try to make them think it wasn&apos;t worth trying to rob us.
		That was my mistake.
	</p>

<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 44 grams of cereal and 70 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had 636 grams of Aztec salad.
		For dinner, I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, I made a pizza to take home, using tapioca cheese I&apos;d brought instead of the restaurant&apos;s dairy cheese, and topped it with seaweed, olives, onions, and bruschetta.
		I had 50 grams of that once I got home to my scale.

	<h2>Hair-removal <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I was right to break down my self-treatments and only focus on one section of my body at a time.
		You have to shave before treating, and shaving a large area of your body takes a lot more time than I&apos;d like it to.
		Shaving my entire body twice per week for the twice-per-week treatments just wouldn&apos;t be feasible.
		And then, of course, the treatments themselves take time.
		I could manager the full-body treatments between terms, but once school starts up, I&apos;d have to cut the treatments short, which wouldn&apos;t be preferable.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="exercise">
	<h2>Exercise</h2>
	<p>
		Between time constraints and exhaustion, I didn&apos;t feel like running my Tuesday errands today.
		I almost skipped them.
		But then I remembered that the main point of the errands is to keep up the exercise and keep up my metabolism.
		I didn&apos;t have a choice.
		I had to go.
		For time constraint reasons, I only went on the main errand, which is to check the drawing at that one store.
		The other errands can wait until tomorrow, which will mean a second trip, and further exercise.
		Then again, I already have a long errand tomorrow, so maybe this&apos;ll wait for another day.
		Just getting to that store and back is most of the trip, and thus most of the exercise.
		I don&apos;t feel like actually entering buildings on foot and going about my business there - the time-consuming part I skipped - really adds much to the actual energy burn total.

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		The academic advisor wrote to me today.
		They informed me that the payment option only becomes available in week six each term, as if that was somehow justification for something.
		That didn&apos;t justify anything though, and in fact was one of the things I&apos;d expressly mentioned as being a major problem.
		They also explained that there aren&apos;t as many course options during late registration.
		I&apos;m not sure why they told me that either.
		I obviously already knew that, as it was one of the things I complained about when it came to them cancelling my registration on me.
		And finally, they recommended using express mail in future terms.
		They want me to pay more for their own refusal to open up the payment option within a reasonable time frame.
		My response:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			I understand that the assessment fee only becomes available in week six, *WHICH IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM*.
			You open up the payment option in week six, then start hassling me that the payment hasn&apos;t arrived by week seven.
			You give me about one week to pay before you&apos;re wanting the payment, and it takes *MUCH* longer to get the payment to you.
			Open the payment option sooner.
			That&apos;s what I keep saying.
			There&apos;s no good reason why we can&apos;t pay in week one, for example.
			By putting off opening the payment option, you are causing huge amounts of stress for absolutely zero reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know there are limited available options during late registration, which is part of why I&apos;m so *ANGRY* that you cancelled my registration on me.
			I learned that there aren&apos;t options during late registration in a previous term when I was having technical difficulties before and you *WAITED UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE DAY* to get back to me, resulting in all the courses filling up on me so I couldn&apos;t get into the ones I needed to get into.
			And now you&apos;ve caused that same mess for me again by cancelling my registrations on me.
			So thanks.
			That&apos;s more stress to add to my plate.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can&apos;t afford to use express mail every term.
			I work minimum wage and I have a lot of medical bills that insurance doesn&apos;t cover.
			If I had money, I wouldn&apos;t be spending it on express mail either, but instead a spending it on a school that didn&apos;t censor me, cancel my registrations on me, avoid opening up payment until a week before they want the money, run a website that eats my coursework and refuse to fix it, and cause me huge amounts of stress.
			The lack of money that keeps me here also makes express mail not a viable option.
		</p>
		<p>
			I talked with my credit union yesterday, and they can stop payment on the cheque and reissue it.
			I talked to the post office today, and the local one can&apos;t send express mail out-of-state, so they can&apos;t send my tuition cheque to you overnight, but they said that the post office in the next city over can send things to California overnight.
			I&apos;ll have to bike to the next city over, as I don&apos;t have any other transportation, but I&apos;ll get the cheque you already have voided so I can send you the new one.
			This time, I&apos;ll have a tracking number for you and the delivery will require a signature, so you won&apos;t be able to deny that it arrived this time, even if you mess up again and lose it.
			I don&apos;t have time to bike to the next city over today though, so it&apos;ll have to wait until tomorrow, and you&apos;ll have your new cheque the day after that.
		</p>

	<p>
		To get across how livid I am, I didn&apos;t address the letter, and I almost didn&apos;t even sign it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I made some of this sound a bit more dire than it is, just to get the point across.
		I would opt for a better school if I could afford to, that&apos;s for sure, though I could still make ends meet and still send the cheque via express mail every terms.
		The post office told me today that it&apos;d cost $25.5 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> each time.
		It&apos;s much more than I want to spend on this garbage school, but it wouldn&apos;t mean starving or being unable to pay my medical bills.
		The only actual lie though is that they post office is sending me to the next city over.
		They&apos;re actually sending me to a different post office in town.
		In all fairness though, the one in the next city over is actually closer than the one they sent me to, I think.
		Maybe not.
		Either way, it&apos;s pretty far out from where I live, and is a trip I shouldn&apos;t have to make just to deal with the school&apos;s garbage.
		My only consolation for this unnecessary effort is that I&apos;m fat and need the exercise anyway.
		If I didn&apos;t head to the credit union in one direction then the post office in the other, I should probably find some other long bike ride to go on tomorrow.

	<h2>Keys</h2>
	<p>
		The bike lock company says they have accepted my replacement key request, and will be sending two keys.
		They say that they estimate the keys will arrive within eight business days, which is ten actual days.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I started to see the futility in my mods again.
		I&apos;m trying to pack as much functionality as I can in using palettes, but Minetest Game isn&apos;t built that way.
		Coming up with all the ideas for these similar nodes is difficult.
		But getting the numbers to add up is outright impossible as long as I use Minetest Game as a base.
		With that in mind, I toyed with the idea of starting my own subgame again.
	</p>
	<p>
		To start with, I tried running an old script I have for finding the nodes the engine directly references using the source code.
		I needed a node list to begin from.
		The source code has changed too much since the last time I ran the script though, so it&apos;s not working now.
		I spent probably at least half an hour debugging, but didn&apos;t complete the project.
		I&apos;ll need to pick this up again later.
	</p>

<section id="baked">
	<h2>Baked shift leader</h2>
	<p>
		Business had slowed down for the night, so pretty much everyone was sent home.
		Only one shift leader and I remained.
		No matter how slow it gets, we tend to keep at least two people.
		I guess part of it is for accountability, but also, we keep both the drive-through window and the lobby open until closing time, and if we just happened to get customers at both places at once, one person wouldn&apos;t be able to keep up, especially if we ended up with a line at both ends.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went to take some soda crates out to the back, where we stash the empty ones, and the shift leader caught me to talk about the plan for the night.
		They were on break, and I could tell they&apos;d gotten high from their flushed cheeks and red eyes.
		That was unexpected, but I didn&apos;t really mind.
		They&apos;re pretty chill about things, and when people don&apos;t get uptight about nothing, I tend not to care if they break the small rules.
		Business was slow, and this shouldn&apos;t interfere with anything.
		They told me everything was done except taking inventory and dealing with the waste, and that we&apos;d do those things half an hour before closing.
		That seemed on-par for what we normally do, as getting that stuff done late means not having to do it a second time after more customers have come through and changed our numbers on us.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, a bit later, we had a sudden rush.
		Lots of customers came from both sides, and we ran out of certain menu items because we&apos;d thinned down for the night.
		We weren&apos;t keeping up as well as would be optimal, but we did take care of everyone&apos;s orders.
		I still didn&apos;t mind though, as long as I didn&apos;t get blamed.
		And I didn&apos;t.
		I think we did well enough, considering that we weren&apos;t expecting a surge in customers.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the rush ended, the shift leader went into the back and laid on the table, while I ran around the store taking care of everything else.
		There was the inventory and the waste to deal with, but also the things that can&apos;t be done until we close anyway, which were unstated but understood between us.
		The shift leader got up in time to close one of the registers while I was closing the other one, but aside form that, I handled everything.
		They seemed a little surprised that I&apos;d taken care of the inventory, probably because that&apos;s not officially my job yet, but I didn&apos;t really have a reason <strong>*not*</strong> to handle it.
	</p>
	<p>
		We ended up getting out of the store later than normal, as I was the only one taking care of things, but I didn&apos;t mind.
		I&apos;d been stationed on the front register all night.
		That&apos;s probably the least taxing position in the store, and I&apos;ve had to deal with the rush of the pizza dress station for a couple days lately.
		I still had plenty of energy.
		And I didn&apos;t really have a reason to be in a rush to leave.
		I mean, don&apos;t get me wrong, I hurried, but I didn&apos;t feel like I was in a race against the clock.
		I just didn&apos;t poke along.
		Besides, this was good practice for me.
		The more practice I get, the faster I&apos;ll be at the manager tasks that I&apos;m going to need to start performing on a more-regular basis.
		Practically working alone is something it wouldn&apos;t hurt to get used to either.
		I don&apos;t know who I&apos;m going to be closing with, and working with people that don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing might happen more often than I think.
		Of course, this shift leader does know what they&apos;re doing; I&apos;m not implying otherwise.
