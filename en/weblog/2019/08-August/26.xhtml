<section id="repair">
	<h2>Tube repair</h2>
	<p>
		Repairing the inner tubes wasn&apos;t complicated, but it was very time-consuming, and I ended up losing a few hours of sleep, as expected.
		A good chunk of that time was spent waiting for glue to dry too, it wasn&apos;t actual labour time.
		For some reason, you have to apply the glue, wait for it to dry, then apply the patch.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can&apos;t find the hole in the latest flat inner tube.
		I inflated the tube, and it even stayed inflated as long as I stayed awake, but when I got up in the morning, it had gone flat again.
		I&apos;ll have to try putting the tire underwater and locating the bubble stream before I can patch this particular tire, but that can wait.
		I now have two working inner tubes in the bike and five spares.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 63 grams of cereal and 111 grams of soy milk.
		Out of stress, I skipped lunch and ate an entire 340-gram bag of pretzels.
		For dinner, I had 457 grams of Aztec salad.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="bras">
	<h2>Bras</h2>
	<p>
		I tried getting a bra that fit me better today, but the flat bras available at the store didn&apos;t use the size format I found online.
		There were no band sizes or cup sizes, though I suppose on a flat bra, you wouldn&apos;t need a cup size.
		The lack of a band size made it impossible to know what size to get though.
		The options were &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, &quot;extra large&quot;, and &quot;triple extra large&quot;.
		I ended up getting the extra large one, hoping I wasn&apos;t fat enough to fill a triple extra large one, and with no double extra large in stock.
		When I got it home, I found it a bit too snug on me, but I think I can make it work.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I checked in with the credit union today to see if they could void a cashier&apos;s cheque they&apos;d issued and reissue it.
		It turns out they can.
		They say I just need to bring the cheque stub, probably either to help them identify the cheque or to prove I really was the one it was issued to.
		Probably the former, as the cheque is tied to my account, so they just need my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> to verify that I&apos;m the account holder to verify that I&apos;m supposed to be the one with the cheque.
		I&apos;ll need to check in with the post office to see if they offer a rush delivery option with a tracking number and signature verification upon delivery.
		If they do, I&apos;ll get the cheque voided and resent, this time paying extra to make sure the school can&apos;t deny when it gets there.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/26.png" alt="A chest full of stone" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t do much in Minetest today, but I did continue cooking cobble into stone.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="mould">
	<h2>Black mould</h2>
	<p>
		I got a chance to check out the machine today before it got cleaned.
		It was fine.
		Not a speck of black in sight.
		That means it either was mould that I cleaned off or some other build-up that takes more than a day to accumulate.
		In either case, it wasn&apos;t getting cleaned properly each night like it should have been.
		I&apos;ll keep an eye on it, and if it builds up to visible levels again, I&apos;ll talk to management about it.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="sexist">
	<h2>An idiotic and sexist customer</h2>
	<p>
		A customer came in complaining about a pizza that wasn&apos;t as fresh as i should have been.
		If they&apos;d left it at that, there wouldn&apos;t have been a problem, and I would have gladly made an exchange for them as is our policy to do.
		However, they had to continue, adding sexism and idiocy to their spiel.
		It took me so off-guard that I was unable to react, and I still made the exchange without saying much except to apologise for the hassle, but it really showed me what a sexist and idiot they really were.
		To start with, they told me that women are cooks.
		Um.
		Not all women.
		This is the modern day, and women don&apos;t have to cook any more than men do if they don&apos;t want to.
		And secondly, they claimed that as cooks, they can tell when food isn&apos;t fresh.
		Um.
		You don&apos;t need to be a cook to tell when food isn&apos;t fresh.
		That&apos;s just completely illogical thinking, there.
		If that sort of thing happens again, I should at the very least bring up that not all women are cooks, and to imply otherwise is completely sexist.
		Whether I point out that you don&apos;t need to be a cook to recognise unfresh food though would depend on my mood.
