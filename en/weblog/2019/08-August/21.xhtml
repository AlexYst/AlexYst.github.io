<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 52 grams of cereal and 77 grams of soy milk.
		I didn&apos;t really get around to making lunch, and had 388 grams of pretzels.
		For dinner, I had a 703-gram smoothie.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think I overate a bit today.
		I should be fine though.
		My metabolism should still be up, so while I won&apos;t lose as much today, at least I shouldn&apos;t gain any weight.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="laptop">
	<h2>Purism laptop</h2>
	<p>
		My goal for the day was to get my Purism laptop set up, so it could replace my dying laptop.
		This mainly included getting Aptitude configured to run over <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> and getting <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer installed so I could have the new laptop get onto the Wi-Fi access points that my dying laptop is on a whitelist of.
		I couldn&apos;t get the package manager to function though.
		Aptitude wasn&apos;t installed, and both <code>apt-get</code> and the graphical package manager that seems to be specific to PureOS weren&apos;t letting me install stuff.
		Attempted software installs ended in error, as did attempts to update the repository information (<kbd>sudo apt-get update</kbd>).
		I was at a loss as to what to do.
		I&apos;d failed for today, which was sucky.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, for a while, I couldn&apos;t get the application menu to open if an application had already been started, even if that application had later been closed, making it so I had to reboot to even try something else.
		Someone tried to help me debug that issue, though once they started advising, the issue entirely disappeared without my changing anything.
		I&apos;m not sure what was going on, which means I&apos;m not sure how to avoid the issue in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I got home, the on-site apartment manager&apos;s mother was curious as to what I&apos;d been up to while I was out, so I explained my computer troubles.
		They thought the apartment manager could help, being good with computers.
		I was sceptical, as most people who are &quot;good with computers&quot; are actually just good with Windows-based computers.
		That&apos;s all well and good, but would be of zero help to me.
		I shot off an email to the Purism support team, as the dying laptop had stopped connecting to the Internet over at the library where I&apos;d been trying to install the software I needed on the PureOS machine, then took the Purism machine to the apartment manager.
		Surprisingly, they had the solution: run <kbd>sudo apt full-upgrade</kbd>.
		Apparently, bare <code>apt</code> is now a command, you don&apos;t need to run use <code>apt-get</code>, and that pretty much updated everything so the package managers were able to do their job.
		Also, they gave me the passwords to their two Wi-Fi routers, on condition that I don&apos;t tell the passwords to our other neighbours.
		At this point, I can use the Purism machine to connect to the Internet in one corner of my bedroom.
		That&apos;s good enough for me.
		I&apos;m not even going to need to spoof my dying laptop&apos;s <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address on the new machine, though I might still install <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer and set it to use a random <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address each time for privacy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, the support team wrote back later linking to a page with several solutions, most of which were irrelevant, but I did search the page and find the same solution the manager provided.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="tomorrow">
	<h2>Tomorrow&apos;s goals</h2>
	<p>
		I guess I have three main goals for tomorrow.
		Mainly, I need to finish setting up this laptop.
		That will involve transferring my files from the dying machine, and using a script I currently have on the dying machine that configures <code>iptables</code> to block all non-<abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>, non-<abbr title="local area network">LAN</abbr> connections.
		Aptitude is already installed at this point, and the package managers are configured to run over <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondly, I need to check the local second-hand store for a whiteboard.
		They won&apos;t have one, but I&apos;ve got to keep checking every once in a while.
		I&apos;ve been keeping a to-do list during this break from school on my calendar whiteboard in the margin, but the list keeps growing and I&apos;m running out of space.
		I think I can keep focused on what I need to do better when I have this to-do list on the wall near may calendar, but the calendar itself doesn&apos;t have the space for it, not to mention that I need that margin space for jotting down quick notes about my dietary habits when I&apos;m not in a position to type them up in my journal for the day just yet.
		While I&apos;m there, I should check for slippers, as getting some slippers for when I&apos;m doing laundry is also on my list, but at this point, that&apos;s low on the priority list.
		I&apos;ll just be checking because I&apos;ll already be there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, I&apos;ve been planning for almost a week to use tomorrow&apos;s <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting as a time to type up my unpublished recipes in a better format; one I can include on this website.
		Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have a photograph of the cake I made that one time when I tried to make brownies, so I&apos;ll need to make that cake again before I can get the page for that set up, but I should get the other recipes uploaded to the website on the next website update.
		Come to think of it, I should add making cake to my to-do list.
		I shouldn&apos;t eat much of it, seeing as I&apos;m trying to <strong>*stop*</strong> being fat, so maybe I&apos;ll bring it to work and try to get my workmates to eat it or something.
		Eating a little bit of the cake shouldn&apos;t be a problem though.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/21.png" alt="Coffee Tower" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I made decent progress on Coffee Tower, I suppose, though it needs to be a whole lot higher if it&apos;s going to be at all useful to me.
		It would go much faster if I wasn&apos;t building all these windows, and instead built the tower only out of full cubic nodes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Near the end of the day, I started thinking about how tall it needs to be before it reaches peak usefulness.
		I&apos;d mentioned before that I can stack a full inventory minus one stack, plus maybe one item, and make my grinding strategy work.
		That was actually a miscalculation though.
		Due to the fact that I need to fill all but the one inventory slot with a stack of one item each, we need to subtract one from each stack (a total of 31) to get the actual number of items I can grind in a single session, given that the session was long enough and I had enough items to grind.
		I thought about harvesting nearly a full inventory of pine needles and setting up a marker to tell me when to stop building the tower, then try to go up at least one hundred metres per day.
		In the end though, I remembered that this was the wrong way to go about this.
		The limiting factor right now isn&apos;t how high would even be useful.
		Rather, the limiting factor right now is that I don&apos;t even have enough stone to reach that point.
		All I need to do is use up most of my stone, then I can call it good for now and head back into the mine.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note, it seems that as I fall, I can catch on the windows and take damage, even though I can&apos;t actually fit into the windows and stand in them.
		I&apos;m not sure why that is, and I suspect it&apos;s a glitch.
		But anyway, falling down the tower, even with intent to grab the ladder near the bottom, doesn&apos;t always work because I might catch on a windowsill and die long before I reach the bottom.
		The windows weren&apos;t as great of an idea as I previously thought they&apos;d be, but I still stand by the decision to include them.
		Once the ceiling is put on this tower, they&apos;ll be needed to let light in, not to mention that they&apos;re saving me some valuable stone at this point.
		I thought I had way too much before, but now that I&apos;ve got a stone-built project, I&apos;m finding I don&apos;t have anywhere near enough.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="plants">
	<h2>Aloe and spider plants</h2>
	<p>
		One of my neighbours showed me their tomato plant, which is doing very well.
		The vines are about as long as they are tall.
		Somehow, the conversation turned to my plants, and I mentioned that one of my two aloes is dying.
		I guess when I got it, it was about seven aloes that likely split off from the same one, and continue to reside in the same pot.
		The &quot;second&quot; aloe is actually an eighth aloe, and seems to be a separate species, having a different texture and pattern.
		But anyway, all of the one type are dying, and I&apos;m not sure how to save them.
		The neighbour offered to try to doctor up the aloe and give it back, but I told them that if they could save it, they could keep it.
		I don&apos;t know what I did to the poor thing, but in my hands, it&apos;s likely a goner.
		If they&apos;re able to save it, it&apos;s better off with them.
		They said they&apos;d use it for its gel, as it&apos;s apparently good for cerises.
		I never actually tried to use the aloe plant for anything, and just sort of kept it around, but if they can save it&apos;s life, any small injury they give it later will pale in comparison.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not that I object to using plants for things like that, obviously.
		But in this context, of the plant being better off in their care, it&apos;s something that makes sense to mention.
	</p>
	<p>
		A bit later, the neighbour offered me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophytum_comosum">spider plant</a>, saying they were easier to care for.
		I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve taken it, out of fear I&apos;d kill that one too, but Summer used to have spider plants, so I knew how prolific they are.
		They have a tendency to generate offshoot vines that bud into clones of the original plant, so I figured the neighbour wouldn&apos;t be giving much up by giving me one of those budded clones.
		After accepting the offer, the neighbour said they had too many already, and that their largest one looked like it was about to generate a bunch more babies, so my hunch was right.
		They were actually happy to lose one of them (without killing it, I mean), as they&apos;ve got more of them than they want.
		I&apos;m not very good at plant care, but neither is Summer, and her spider plants managed to thrive.
