	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed my father was a queer protester, and for some reason it was Summer that was on my side.
		Some of the police officers were on the side of the protesters too.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to sleep and dreamed that I was playing some sort of Web-based quiz game for working on building thinking skills.
		Cyrus wouldn&apos;t stop doing things on my account though, no matter how many times I kept telling him to get his own account, and I was worried it was going to mess with my ranking in the system.
		Whether his impact was positive or negative, it didn&apos;t matter.
		I wanted my ranking to be my own.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 65 grams of cereal and 87 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch and dinner, I had 439 grams and 461 grams of Aztec salad.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="errands">
	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t have a whole lot of time today, but I did have time for a small errand trip.
		First, I redeemed one of the two bags of bottles my father gave me for their deposit.
		I&apos;ve got two bags left, one from him, and one I&apos;ve been gathering on my own.
		Next, I picked up a new pair of non-slip shoes to replace the one my workmate stole from me, as well as a jar of pickles.
		Picking up pickles was seriously one of the items on the to-do list I have written on my whiteboard, so I can check that off now.
		It was the least-important item on the list, but I didn&apos;t have time for any of the other items today.
		As a side note, getting those shoes wasn&apos;t even on the list.
		It just sort of needed to get done soon anyway.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/25.png" alt="Burning saplings" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		One of the reasons I was so happy to use stone materials for building Coffee Tower is that it&apos;d get the cobble out of my chests and free them up for other things.
		However, I&apos;ve been finding that about as quickly as the chests empty of cobble, they fill back up with saplings, as I continually need to harvest trees for fuel to cook the cobble into stone for stone blocks and stone bricks, which make the tower look so much less lazily built.
		I&apos;d been debating back and forth about using my excess saplings as furnace fuel themselves.
		It seemed like such a waste, but at the same time, there&apos;s simply not enough space in the world, let alone enough dirt, to support an exponentially-growing number of saplings, not to mention that I have no intention of continually growing out my tree farm.
		In practice, I just stash my saplings in one of a growing number of chests.
		They&apos;re taking up space and providing no value.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, I finally decided to take the plunge.
		I&apos;ve started burning off all my excess saplings.
		They make a terrible fuel source in terms of how long they burn, but this gets them out of the chests so I can stop expanding my storage areas so quickly.
		I&apos;m probably going to consolidate, even.
		With the cobble and the saplings gone, I don&apos;t really need my upper basement, and&apos;ll probably block it off or fill it in after moving all the stuff it contains into the attic.
		That basement only has less than a chest of non-stone materials.
		That&apos;s a lot more manageable of a figure, no to mention that I&apos;m planning to find uses for most of those materials in builds as well.
		It&apos;ll take a while before I use them though, as I want to save them for when I have some other types of materials to use with them, such as apple wood and glacier ice.
	</p>

<section id="mould">
	<h2>Maybe mould</h2>
	<p>
		I wasn&apos;t put on the pizza dress station at work today, so by the time I could get anywhere near the pizza-dressing machine, it had already been cleaned for the night.
		because of that, i didn&apos;t get a chance to see if the black gunk had built up again.
		If I could just see that build up in a day, I&apos;d know for sure it was just burnt pan gunk and not something unsanitary such as mould.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="tires">
	<h2>Flat tires</h2>
	<p>
		After work, I went to ride my bike home, only to find that it had a flat tire.
		Again.
		This is getting really aggravating.
	</p>
	<p>
		Honestly, getting my inner tubes patched was high on my remaining to-do list.
		I wanted to spend tomorrow shopping for a bra that fit me better to hide my nipples under that one shirt without the bra itself being overly visible, and on Tuesday, I have my first home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment and my regular Tuesday errands.
		After that though, on Wednesday, I was going to look up a tutorial on patching inner tubes and get all my popped tubes patched so I&apos;d once again have spares.
		But no.
		Now my tube has popped again, I&apos;ve got no spare tubes, and I&apos;ve got to stay up late tonight learning to patch tubes and batch-patching my set of broken ones.
		Joy.
		If at all possible, I&apos;m still going bra-shopping tomorrow, so I need my bike in working order before I get up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, I&apos;ve got my health goals to think of.
		I ended up having to walk home.
		If I hadn&apos;t run errands by bike earlier in the day, I wouldn&apos;t have gotten half of the twenty minutes of biking I&apos;m trying to fit into each day at a minimum.
