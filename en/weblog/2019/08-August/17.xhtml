	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I still lived with Summer, and she was having one of her tantrums.
		My current personality carried over into the dream though, so I had the strength I&apos;ve gained when apart from her; the strength she always tore down before I could build when I lived with her.
		Because of that, I started making plans to move out and not have to deal with her any more.
		Her temper escalated quickly though, and while I was just listening to her in silence, and planning my escape, she started physically assaulting me.
		It was the pain of getting sucker punched in the stomach that woke me up.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to sleep and dreamed she was throwing a tantrum about raking, and ended up not letting me rake the lawn at all because she didn&apos;t like the way I was raking it.
	</p>

	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		Last night, I picked up the ingredients I needed for that Aztec salad I like, but while I doubled the quantities of most of the ingredients, I forgot to double the number of tomatoes I needed, so I found today that I didn&apos;t have enough.
		I ended up needing to make a grocery run for only two tomatoes.
		That wasn&apos;t very efficient, though I suppose the exercise was good.
	</p>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 48 grams of cereal and 83 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had 486 grams of Aztec salad, later having 342 grams as a snack.
		I had 255 grams of it for dinner, and 257 more grams after work.
		While this salad is delicious and probably nutritious, it doesn&apos;t actually provide many calories, so I&apos;ve got to eat a lot of it.
		I also snacked on 195 grams of pretzels.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I read the entire manual today.
		It wasn&apos;t overly long.
		I took two main things from it.
		First, I need to do a patch test, using all five of the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>&apos;s intensity settings, and see which setting is the highest that doesn&apos;t cause too much irritation.
		I&apos;ll need to stop with the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> for a couple days, so I can see what effects the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> has on my skin.
		After that, I can&apos;t treat that area for a week.
		Secondly, I need to set up a schedule before I start of when I&apos;ll be using the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>.
		I&apos;m supposed to start out using it twice each week, at least a couple days apart, then taper off later.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/17.png" alt="Tracks going down intl the tunnel through the water" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I managed to get a little bit of mese so I could extend the rails down into the mine, but not nearly enough.
		For now, the mine is extending faster than the rails are, which is making travel between the surface and the end of the mine rather tedious.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m cancelling the <code>amalgam</code> project.
		It&apos;s a nice idea, but it&apos;s way too messy
		I&apos;m going to try for a series of smaller-but-cleaner mods instead.
		For example, I&apos;ll have one chest mod that&apos;ll define 256 types of chests, but those chests will be made form materials players have access to without creating bizarre and freaky plants first.
	</p>

<section id="promotion">
	<h2>A promotion?</h2>
	<p>
		I learned today that employees train to be shift leaders for about a month here before becoming actual shift leaders.
		I don&apos;t feel like my training has even begun yet though.
		The head manager keeps saying they&apos;ll start training me next week, but then next week comes, and they don&apos;t.
		They&apos;ve shown me a handful of random duties I&apos;ll need to know, but that&apos;s all so far.
		I also learned yesterday though that there&apos;s a mass quitting going on.
		We&apos;re losing a few of out shift leaders even, so that raises my chances of actually getting the job.
		One of my other workmates is now a shift-leader-in-training now too, and while on the surface, that looks like more competition for the role, I think it&apos;s actually more of a sign that we&apos;re actually going to be needing a few new shift leaders soon.
		I honestly think we&apos;ll both get the job.
