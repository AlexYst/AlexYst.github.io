<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 59 grams of cereal and 67 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, a snack, and dinner, I had 357, 391, and 316 grams of Aztec salad.
		I also snacked on 265 grams of pretzels.
		A workmate gave me a 500-millilitre iced tea, which I enjoyed, and ended up having a second one.
		I probably shouldn&apos;t have had the second one.
		They were too sugary for someone trying to lose weight.
		The Mormons wouldn&apos;t be happy I had either one, because they&apos;re opposed to tea for some reason, but they suddenly dropped out of my life again, so it&apos;s not like they can continue expecting me to live by their codes.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		My goal today was to sit down with my calendar and decide which days I should use the home hair-removal <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> each week.
		School is the biggest factor, I think.
		On Thursday and Friday, I&apos;ve got to get my initial discussion posts in, so I need all the time I can get.
		I should therefore postpone my treatment until Saturday.
		From there, I need to wait no less than two and no more than three days between treatment dates, so I need my other treatment to be on Tuesday or Wednesday.
		Wednesday would be more convenient due to my Tuesday errands, but Wednesday is often my only day off from work aside from Thursday, so I often use it to finish up my coursework.
		I&apos;m probably going to do this on Tuesdays, and possibly have to give up my errand day or cut my errands short.
		I&apos;ll probably do the patch test tomorrow, then start actual treatment on Saturday.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to the manual to figure out how many times per week I&apos;m supposed to use the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> during each phase of treatment and found I&apos;d misinterpreted one of the diagrams.
		Basically, I&apos;m supposed to treat myself twice each week for twelve weeks, and the diagram breaks down what&apos;s going on for three phases during those twelve weeks.
		The whole time though, I use the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> twice each week.
		After that, hair should disappear &quot;permanently&quot;, but might show up again every three months or so, at which point I need to do maintenance treatments.
		Maybe after enough times of the hair coming back and getting killed again, it actually does go away for good though.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I&apos;ve sort of been trying to rush the bridge project since I finished up at World&apos;s Navel.
		I thought I was at the final stretch, and if I could get just a little further, I&apos;d be free from Sleepless Isle.
		This really isn&apos;t the case though.
		There&apos;s much more mining to do, and starting a new mine, even if it is a better one, sort of reset my some of my progress.
		I just need to take it slow, and continue on here on the island for the time being.
		Also of note, when I do move off the island, I should first stockpile powered rails.
		If I don&apos;t, I&apos;ll have to deal with a lack of rails again in my new mine at my new home.
		If I have enough rails to get down to where the mese was though, the new mine will be much less of a setback next time.

<section id="Internet">
	<h2>Internet service</h2>
	<p>
		In the mail today, I received an offer for reasonably-priced Internet service without a contract.
		The catch is that you have to meet certain eligibility requirements, and they appear to be essentially income-based.
		The local <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> normally tries to majorly rip people off, but it appears that for some reason, they&apos;ve got separate prices that they&apos;ll offer to us poor folk.
		It could be that the government is requiring them to do this or they lose their monopoly over the area.
		More likely, the government is paying the remainder or part of the remainder of the bill.
		However, the terms on the advert say that if at any point you no longer qualify and you keep your service anyway, you&apos;ll be charged their regular, price-gouging rates.
		My guess is that you have to cancel before they decide you&apos;re ineligible or they hit you with the higher rate; they probably don&apos;t give you the opportunity to cancel at the point they decide not to keep you in the program.
		I think tomorrow, I&apos;ll bike over to Eugene and ask about their requirements.
		I&apos;ll need to be very careful about making sure that any time they ask me to reverify something, I first verify on my own and check it against their then-current qualifications.
		If I no longer seem to qualify, I need to cancel the service instead of verifying anything.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="promotion">
	<h2>A promotion?</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager said they promise they&apos;ll work on training me tomorrow.
		They also said that if they aren&apos;t able to do it tomorrow, they&apos;ll do it later in the week though, which means it&apos;s not so much of a guarantee that they&apos;ll get to it tomorrow, not to mention that they&apos;ve been telling me they&apos;ll do it &quot;next week&quot; for a few weeks now.
		I&apos;m not too worried though.
		If I manage to become a shift leader before I leave this place, it won&apos;t matter how quickly or slowly it happened, and I&apos;m going to be trapped here for the foreseeable future, so there&apos;s really no rush.
		If it happens at all, I can put it on my résumé, and that&apos;s mainly what I want from this anyway.
		The promotion itself is pretty meaningless to me.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="battery">
	<h2>Battery</h2>
	<p>
		I just received an email tonight telling me the battery for the GT-i9100 shipped.
		I was given a link to a tracking page, so I tried to check that out, so I&apos;d know where to look for the shipping status later.
		You have to log in to see the page though, and they&apos;ve now locked me out of my account.
		This is getting ridiculous.
		I&apos;m getting locked out of accounts on different websites left and right.
		Theoretically though, the battery should arrive at some point, and if it doesn&apos;t, I&apos;ll reverse the charge through the credit card company.
		I mean, first I&apos;ll try finding a way to contact the site&apos;s support team, but if I can&apos;t find contact information or they won&apos;t talk to me, that should be pretty good grounds for the card company to allow me to reverse the charge.
