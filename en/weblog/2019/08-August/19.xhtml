<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was in the back yard of the house I used to live in on H Street.
		For some reason, there was a dresser up against the house.
		I opened it, and found gooey dough.
		It looked like cookie dough that&apos;d been left out in the rain, or something.
		I felt the presence of a creature called the I-Angel though; it&apos;d heard the creaky dresser open.
		I&apos;m not sure exactly what it&apos;s intention was, what it would do to me if I didn&apos;t escape, or even what the creature was aside form its name, but I knew I had to get the dresser closed, then get away before it saw me.
		Closing the dresser took a couple valuable seconds and again made noise.
		I had to run around the house and get in the front door though, and for some reason, I couldn&apos;t run properly.
		I knew it wasn&apos;t the I-Angel&apos;s doing, it was just a problem with my body.
		I made it though, but barely.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can&apos;t remember the running issue enough to even describe what the problem was, but before it faded too much from my mind from being awake too long, I remembered that it was a problem I&apos;ve had multiple times, but only in dreams.
		I think it kept ending up with me off my feet though.
		If I could remember what the problem was, I could add it to my list of things I know I must be dreaming if I experience.
		For example, I&apos;ve got this other leg issue that happens in dreams, which makes it feel like the air is so viscous that I can barely walk.
		I stay upright, but I can&apos;t get anywhere fast.
		This was definitely different though, as I was moving much faster than I can when I&apos;m dealing with the viscous air, and the viscous air never takes me off my feet.

<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 63 grams of cereal and 101 grams of soy milk.
		For each lunch, a snack, and dinner, I had 386, 398, and 337 grams of Aztec salad.
		Dinner also included 19 potato nuggets.
		I snacked on 147 grams of pretzels throughout the day.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Internet">
	<h2>Internet service</h2>
	<p>
		Frustratingly, I found that the people at the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s public sales location won&apos;t give me any useful information about the reasonably-priced Internet service.
		They did confirm my suspicions that it&apos;s a government-subsidised program though.
		The government may or may not be getting paying a reduced rate though due to some law-imposed obligation on the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s part.
		I just don&apos;t know.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, they called some telephone support number, then annoyingly put me on the line and had me hold for about ten minutes.
		In the end, I got matched with someone with a thick accent that I could barely understand, and they chained requirements together with &quot;and&quot; conjunctions so it sounded like I had to meet every last criteria.
		At the end of the conversation, I still wasn&apos;t sure if I qualify.
		I might need to be a war veteran with children on government assistance.
		Requiring me to have children to get reasonably-priced Internet service would be asinine though.
		I&apos;m pretty sure some of those &quot;and&quot;s were supposed to be &quot;or&quot;s.
		I&apos;ll need to do research online when I have time and see what I can find about the program.
		Telephone calls almost never prove helpful to me, and I hate dealing with telephone support.
		Ugh.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/19.png" alt="One mese crystal on a cave ceiling in the distance, right next to precariously-located silver sand" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		When I got home from Eugene, I looked around a bit in Languescent Mine, where I&apos;d set the game up to grind pine needles and gravel while I was away.
		I noticed a single mese crystal off in the distance, close to some sand I might knock down into the lava if I wasn&apos;t careful.
		I came back with some supplies, and was able to safely get the crystal, but there didn&apos;t seem to be any others nearby.
		That was the only one.
		Even though I&apos;ve put off trying to extend the bridge, every mese crystal I find extends the tracks 18 metres deeper into Albert Herpin&apos;s Mine.
		It&apos;s a long walk down a dark, narrow, jagged mineshaft, and every mese crystal I find shortens that walk and makes the trip back and forth easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		Languescent Mine is too much of a pain to get in and out of when you&apos;re low on things to stack.
		I&apos;ve been thinking about building a &quot;tower of grinding&quot; to do my away-from-keyboard grinding at, but thought I wasn&apos;t going to do it.
		The thing is though, instead of having the beginning and ending point at the top, it&apos;d be at the bottom, which I thought would be a little easier.
		I didn&apos;t realise finishing off grinding was so much of a pain though, and the tower would be a huge improvement.
		One of the reasons I was reluctant to build it was that I wasn&apos;t planning to stay here much longer, and it&apos;d be a big project.
		I&apos;m going to be here a while though, so I might as well, especially with the effort it&apos;ll save me when setting up and coming back from the away-from-keyboard grinding sessions.
		I might put it near Exhaustion Isle.
		I thought about building it into part of a castle before, but now, it will probably be just a long, thin tower.
		I need to plan for a number of things.
		Mainly, they all boil down to the fact that a grinding session may end with everything being ground away, but might end before that.
		That means the floor, at the very least, needs to be something that can&apos;t be dug by hand, such as stone bricks.
		The walls probably should as well.
		I&apos;ll need a quick way down from, as well as back up to, wherever I leave off.
		A wooden ladder would be great for getting up; it&apos;s probably the fastest available option, even if it still a bit slow.
		Getting down might be faster with an accompanying waterfall, though that would require a bucket, which as I mentioned before, I&apos;m putting off crafting.
		Even if I get a bucket though, the waterfall can only help in breaking the fall, it can&apos;t be used to climb up or be used as a replacement for ladders.
		I mean, that&apos;s one of the difficulties in using the Languescent Mine as a grinder: trying to climb a waterfall to get out while trying not to drown.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Testing the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		As I planned for today, I tried out the hair-removal <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>.
		I used my chest as the test site, as it&apos;s a large, flat area I can reach easily and I plan to remove the hair there anyway.
		I&apos;ve been rather nervous.
		I&apos;m not sure if I put off using the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> right away because I was honestly too disorganised to have made time for it sooner or if I was just afraid of the pain.
		In any case, I flashed the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> on five patches of my chest, one on each setting, and now I need to wait twenty-four hours to see if there&apos;s going to be a problem.
		On the low setting, I didn&apos;t feel it.
		One setting up, and I felt what I kind of thought was pain at first, but I think it&apos;s just because I was expecting pain.
		It was really mild, and it was actually more of just a sudden warmth.
		Each time I bumped the setting up again, I felt the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> even more, but I don&apos;t think any of the flashes &quot;hurt&quot;, per se.
		Whether it was pain or not though, it was certainly nothing anywhere close to the agony I&apos;m going to go through tomorrow at my professional <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> appointment.
		I think I&apos;m going to be able to use the high setting once I get started for real.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>&apos;s lamp comes with a set number of flashes.
		After that, I assume it locks up, whether it&apos;s physically capable of emitting more or not, to force you to buy a new lamp.
		This seems to be the industry practice, so even if I had been able to buy whatever <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> I wanted instead of getting locked into this one <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> because other websites wouldn&apos;t sell to me, I don&apos;t think I could escape that issue.
		There&apos;s a counter on the device, too.
		The box told me I had 400 000 flashes; the display started me at 400 080 flashes though, so I get eighty more than advertised.
		Each time I flashed the thing though, the counter did indeed go down, which is what makes me think the lamp will lock up when it hits zero.
		This number isn&apos;t an estimation, like when you buy a light bulb that says it lasts for however many hours, as far as I can tell.
		It&apos;s an counted quota that you&apos;re allowed to hit.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, it seems that after the patch test, I&apos;m not to treat the area I tested for at least, as the manual put it, &quot;one week hours&quot;.
		I&apos;m guessing the manual got edited at some point, and they switched from a number of hours to a full week and forgot to remove the word &quot;hours&quot;, or perhaps the reverse and didn&apos;t get the number in and left the week count.
		In any case, a week is the only estimate I have, so I&apos;ll wait that long.
		In the mean time, I need to decide what part of my body I want to treat first.
		While school is going, I don&apos;t think I can set aside enough time to shave and treat my entire body twice per week, so I&apos;ll need to work in sections.
		I&apos;ll probably start with my chest and belly, to be honest, so maybe doing the patch test there was misguided.
		If I&apos;d tested on my leg, for example, I could have done the real treatment on my chest as early as tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		I received an email from the company I bought from.
		It says to use the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> twice per week for four weeks, then once per week for four weeks, and finally once every two weeks for four weeks.
		In the four weeks after that, they recommend using it &quot;only if needed&quot;.
		I suppose I&apos;ll use those instructions instead of the ones in the manual, as they don&apos;t directly contradict the manual, and instead are a bit more specific.
		They linked to a how-to video too, so I should watch that by next Tuesday, when I plan to use the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> for actual treatment.

<section id="promotion">
	<h2>A promotion?</h2>
	<p>
		Sure enough, as I predicted, the head manager didn&apos;t give me any training today.
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, that&apos;s not technically true.
		They trained me to make the new speciality pizza that just went on the menu today.
		That had nothing to do with management.
		Anyone that even might be working the pizza dress station needs to know that, and on rare occasion, I&apos;ve been put on that station.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now they say they&apos;ll train me on Friday or Saturday.
		Let&apos;s see if that actually happens though.
		I&apos;d five it a fifty-percent chance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then again, maybe I&apos;ve been trained more than I think I have.
		At the end of the night, the head manager had me perform all the closing manager tasks aside from entering the alarm code, as I&apos;m not allowed to know the code yet.
		Then they said I was ready.
		Honestly, if I&apos;ve learned what I&apos;m supposed to learn, then being a shift leader is mostly about counting.
		I&apos;ve been counting for decades; I&apos;ve got this in the bag.
		I do need to get better at telling people what to do though, as that&apos;s obviously the other main manager task, and I need to get better at recognising what I need others to do.
	</p>

<section id="gender">
	<h2>Gender</h2>
	<p>
		I had a customer get a bit weird about the fact that I was wearing nail polish today.
		First, they called me over saying they had a question, then asked if I was a man.
		I told them no, and that I&apos;m non-binary, and they didn&apos;t really get it even after I explained it.
		They just kept asking things such as &quot;But you were born as a man, right?&quot;.
		No, I was born male, but not born a man.
		I tried to explain the difference between sex and gender, and they just insisted that they was no difference and trying to get me to claim to be the man I&apos;m not.
		Eventually, they told me that they only asked because they were wondering why I was wearing nail polish, so I simply replied that it was because I&apos;m not a man.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, they had a lot of odd requests too, such as that they wanted their pizza box bagged.
		Our bags barely fit around the boxes if you have the bag sideways, and really don&apos;t contain them well.
		I&apos;m not sure why you&apos;d want the box bagged anyway though.
		The head manager was listening to part of our conversation, and, once they left, called the customer a troll.
		It was a bit funny.
		I didn&apos;t mention that they had a problem with my nail polish though, which I don&apos;t thing the head manager caught.
		I don&apos;t need them potentially telling me I&apos;ve got to stop wearing it.
		If they do, I&apos;ve got to stand up for my right to wear it, and tell them that if they don&apos;t ban everyone else wearing it too, it&apos;s gender discrimination.
		I really don&apos;t want to have to fight the head manager on this, but I also really don&apos;t want to look like a dude.
		There&apos;s a reason I&apos;m heading in for more <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair-removal treatment tomorrow morning, there&apos;s a reason I tested the new <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> I bought today, a reason I bought it in the first place, and a reason I&apos;m on a waiting list for vocal lessons.
		I&apos;m tired of being perceived as a man.
		Once I&apos;ve fixed my voice, even though my face will still look more masculine than I&apos;d like it to, I think people won&apos;t hassle me as much.
		They still likely won&apos;t see me as non-binary, but they won&apos;t be insisting that I shouldn&apos;t wear nail polish, even if they do think I&apos;m a man.
