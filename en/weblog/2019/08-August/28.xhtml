		For lunch, I had 273 grams of that pizza from last night.
		For dinner, I had 190 grams of pizza, 18 potato nuggets, and 187 grams of Aztec salad.
		Later in the night, I had 297 more grams of Aztec salad.

	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I think the email I sent to the school pretty much sums up what&apos;s going on on that front, so I&apos;ll just leave it at that.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello payments office (or <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>, who will probably intercept this letter like all the other letters I send to various school departments),
		</p>
		<p>
			I biked to the credit union to void the cheque and have it re-issued so I could send it to you again, seeing as you clearly lost the first one.
			However, when I sat down with a banker and they looked up the cheque in their system, they found that you&apos;ve *ALREADY CASHED IT*.
			In fact, you cashed it back on 2019-08-06, which was *BEFORE* you cancelled my course registrations for next term.
			You cancelled my registrations on 2019-08-22, which was *MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER YOU HAD MY PAYMENT*.
			You didn&apos;t lose the cheque as I thought you did.
			You *CASHED THE CHEQUE AND STILL LIED AND CLAIMED I HADN&apos;T PAID*!!
			I am absolutely *FURIOUS*.
			And now, you&apos;ve cancelled my registrations on me, so now *I WON&apos;T BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE COURSES I NEED BECAUSE THEY&apos;LL BE FULL BY THE TIME LATE REGISTRATION STARTS*.
			You&apos;ve caused me a *HUGE* amount of stress for absolutely *NO REASON*.
			Again.
		</p>
		<p>
			I&apos;ve attached the proof the credit union emailed me showing that you have in fact already cashed the cheque.
			Update your records, and remove the financial block on my account.
			Now.
		</p>

		After dealing with this mess, I didn&apos;t do much for the rest of the day.
		I find that anger tires me, both physically and emotionally, and I was just exhausted, even though the day had only really begun.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went to pay rent today though, and the on-site manager and I got to talking for a bit.
		They recommended looking into South New Hampshire University and <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr>, both of which they say have inexpensive online courses.
		If they&apos;re talking about the <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> courses I think they are, those ones don&apos;t count toward a degree.
		It&apos;s worth looking into both once I have more energy though.
		If I could escape this wretched school, that&apos;d be pretty awesome.
		They also recommended filling out the <abbr title="Free Application for Federal Student Aid">FAFSA</abbr> and applying for a full-price school.
		I&apos;m reluctant to deal with the <abbr title="Free Application for Federal Student Aid">FAFSA</abbr> again though.
		Last time, I didn&apos;t get enough from that to cover much, and I can&apos;t afford to blow my savings on school and go back into debt.

<section id="MAC">
	<h2><abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> addresses</h2>
	<p>
		One small task I took on today was setting up <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer.
		No matter what I seemed to try, the burnt-in address was always used instead of the random one, even though <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer was told, during installation, to change the address every time the machine connects to the network.
		When I manually told <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer to randomise the <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address, it did so, and when I toggled the hardware switch for the Wi-Fi card, it got randomised, but any time the machine went to sleep, it had the burnt-in <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address being used when it woke up.
		As I tried researching the problem and trying more tests, I found that the laptop sleeping actually had nothing to do with anything.
		The only thing that did was prompt me to check the address again.
		If I checked a few moments after randomising the address, whether the machine slept or not, it had reset again.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tracked the problem down through a series of search results, and found that the NetworkManager was doing it.
		Every few moments, it resets the <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address.
		It was fighting against <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer and undoing its efforts.
		When I tried using a solution from a second-hand source, I found I could get the randomised <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address to stick, but it wouldn&apos;t randomise again.
		Ostensibly, I&apos;d get a new <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address if I rebooted the machine, causing the old one to be lost, but that didn&apos;t seem overly helpful.
		It was better than where I had been, but not where I wanted to be.
		Taking a look at the cited source though, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/thaller/2016/08/26/mac-address-spoofing-in-networkmanager-1-4-0/">I found explanations of several configuration options</a>, and using trial and error, I arrived at a mostly-working solution.
		You need to edit <a href="file:///etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf"><code>file:///etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf</code></a> and add these lines:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
<pre><code>[connection]
ethernet.cloned-mac-address=random
wifi.cloned-mac-address=random</code></pre>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		You need to <strong>*avoid*</strong> adding these lines:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
<pre><code>[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no</code></pre>
	</blockquote>
</section>
<p>
	If you add those last lines, the address doesn&apos;t randomise on the next connection, even with <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer trying to do its thing.
	The catch to this solution though is that the <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address gets changed every few moments.
	It doesn&apos;t change only when you reconnect.
	Still, at least you&apos;re not using the same address until reboot.
	While not preferable, this solution at least works for the time being.
	Once you&apos;ve edited the configuration file above, use <kbd>sudo service network-manager restart</kbd> to restart NetworkManager so the new configuration will take effect.
	Once you have this set up though, <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> Changer isn&apos;t even needed, as NetworkManager performs the randomisation on its own.
