	<h2>A late night</h2>
	<p>
		I went to visit my father last night.
		As usual, we talked for hours and I ended up staying way too late.
	</p>
	<p>
		He gave me a bunch of redeemable bottles, and a whole tub of random computer parts, minus the tub itself.
		It took two trips to carry it all home, and I had to leave my bike locked up at the nearby department store while I took the tub of parts home on foot.
		The parts included two working mice, three non-working mice, and one potentially-working mouse, along with all sorts of things such as cables, keyboards, and a base station for a cordless home telephone, without the telephone, making the base station useless.
		A lot of it&apos;s just junk, but some of it might come in handy.
		In particular though, that crosses getting a mouse off my to-do list.
	</p>

<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		When I got home past midnight last night, I had 490 grams of Aztec salad before I went to bed.
		For breakfast, I had 49 grams of cereal and 95 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had a 611-gram smoothie and 19 potato nuggets.
		I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dinner.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was walking with large, heavy bags at night.
		I&apos;d locked up my bike near the midway point, beside a bench in a parking lot, and was going to have to come back for it.
		I had another trip to make with more bags, and I was deciding weather I wanted to retrieve the bike next or make the second bag trip next.
		I passed by the bike, only to find that both wheels had been stripped of the bike by some thief.
		At first, I tried to deny what I saw, but when I had to accept it, I freaked out.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="PHP">
	<h2>Configuring <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I figured out why my changes to the <code>php.ini</code> file weren&apos;t making changes in <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>&apos;s configuration like I wanted to: I was editing the wrong <code>php.ini</code> file!
		With the human error issue resolved, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> is now configured properly and I can go back to compiling my journal entries on a daily basis.

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		My academic advisor intercepted my email to the payments office.
		They always do that.
		Not just this advisor, but all the advisors I&apos;ve had.
		If I send an email to any department of the school, it&apos;s the advisor that responds.
		I think the mailboxes are set up such that they get sorted not by the &quot;to&quot; addresses, but by the &quot;from&quot; addresses.
		What is even the point of giving each department their own email address if they&apos;re going to do that?
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, they tried to justify what the payments office was doing.
		I responded again explaining that it&apos;s really not cool, and that if they want payments sooner, they should open up the option to pay sooner.
		I can&apos;t pay until they allow it, and it takes time between when I pay and when they receive the payment.
		I can&apos;t do anything about that.
	</p>

	<h2>A promotion?</h2>
	<p>
		When I came into work today, the head manager gave me a little exercise before having me get to work.
		They gave me a clipboard and a piece of paper, telling me to write down as many important things I as I could see in ten minutes.
		They gave me absolutely zero indication as to what type of thing was &quot;important&quot;, and I had to try to figure it out on my own.
		I tried to write down what I thought a manager should be aware of, attempting not to leave out anything I thought the head manager would care about while also trying not to write too many things the the head manager wouldn&apos;t care about.
		At the end of the ten minutes, I showed them what I&apos;d written, and they told me to walk them through the list.
		It turns out I caught two important things that they hadn&apos;t, though they were tied up at the pizza dress station having their attention pulled in five directions at once, while I was specifically told to wander the store and look for things.
		My finding a couple things they hadn&apos;t noticed doesn&apos;t actually say anything about our comparative awareness, and they&apos;ve already proven they&apos;re much better at keeping track of the whole store at once than I am.
		Still, it was kind of cool to find and correct a couple problems no one else had noticed.
		After I went over the list, the head manager said I was already thinking like a manager, and had no further notes.
		I take that to mean there wasn&apos;t anything else they were expecting me to notice and hadn&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		I mentioned yesterday that the head manager&apos;s lack of empathy is understandable, given the stress they&apos;re under.
		It&apos;s worth noting though that they do us the biggest kindness by reserving the most-stressful position in the store for themself.
		In all likelihood, it&apos;s not an act of compassion exactly.
		It&apos;s more that they know they can handle it, but they&apos;ve got a crew full of incompetent people that can&apos;t.
		Much of the crew really doesn&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing for the most part.
		Motivation aside though, their decision to take on that station relieves us all of that burden.
		I&apos;d also called them cowardly in the past due to their outright refusal to talk to customers that ask to speak with a manager.
		I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the problem any more.
		They&apos;re pressed for time as it is.
		They don&apos;t need their attention pulled in yet another direction, and they especially don&apos;t need their time siphoned away.
		I&apos;ve never mentioned it in my journal, but the head manager often sends people on simple fetch tasks when they need supplies.
		I&apos;ve always thought it lazy of them.
		Seriously, they&apos;d just need to walk around the corner into the refrigerator for most of the things they ask for.
		Why send someone else?
		It all makes sense though.
		It&apos;s not lazy at all.
		They&apos;re already so pressed for time, and offloading the fetch tasks helps the head manager far more than it slows down the person they send.
		I&apos;ve never actually minded performing the fetch tasks when sent, I only thought it odd they didn&apos;t do them themself.
		I haven&apos;t resorted to sending others to fetch stuff for me yet, but I now see why they do it.
		I considered doing it just as practice for giving orders, but it&apos;s just not in my nature.
		Maybe it&apos;s something I need to work on.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the awareness exercise, I spent the first hour of my shift practically working alone again, though that first hour was slow, so it wasn&apos;t overly challenging.
		For the next hour, the head manager said they&apos;d take care of the custom orders and they just wanted me to focus on running the pizza-making machine.
		Just taking care of the orders took the majority of the burden off of me though, so I was able to take care of everything else with ease.
		I manned the telephones, threw in pizzas, and ran the machine.
		Not having to make custom pizzas on top of everything else, there was pretty much no stress.
		For the next four hours, I had help on and off, but it seems like the head manager was always there for the worst parts of it.
		The job is so much easier when it&apos;s cut in half, so having their help kept things from getting bad during the busy periods like they did yesterday.
		Yesterday, I feel like my training was to prepare me for the level of chaos of the pizza dress station, but that wasn&apos;t the goal for today.
		Today, I was just to get experience with the pizza-making machine.
	</p>
	<p>
		There was a bit of verbal lesson today.
		They explained a bit about giving breaks.
		First, they explained how many breaks an employee gets based on the number of hours worked.
		We don&apos;t exactly follow the law, but everyone I&apos;ve talked to prefers it this way, and so do I.
		Mandatory unpaid lunch breaks are obnoxious, as we don&apos;t need that much of a break, and if we&apos;re stuck here, we&apos;d like to get paid.
		I already knew this, but the rule here is that you get a paid, ten-minute break about every two hours, unless you&apos;ve got less than four hours left in your shift.
		To put it mathematically, the number of breaks you get is <code>floor(number_of_hours_in_your_shift / 2) - 1</code>.
		They said that it was good to get breaks out of the way before we start mopping.
		We start mopping at around 18:30, it seems.
		I&apos;d never really paid attention to when we mop.
		I guess I&apos;m not usually the one mopping though.
		I tend to start trying to start cleaning my station at around 20:00, if I&apos;m not on landing, and if I&apos;m on landing, I try to start a lot sooner, though I can&apos;t start until the rush ends, which varies.
		They also said not to give people on landing a break while there are a lot of outstanding orders so the orders don&apos;t get mixed up in the process.
		Tell them to finish the orders before going on break.
		If a seasoned employee is to cover the lander&apos;s breaks, it can be alright to allow breaks during times of high order volume though.
		And finally, have the person you least need be the person covering the breaks.
		For example, if you&apos;ve got plenty of dough flattened into pans already, have the dough-flattener be the one to cover breaks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Near the end of my time working the pizza dress station, they showed me how to clean out and clean down the pizza-making machine.
		Most of it was pretty basic, though I needed the instruction so I&apos;d know what needed to be done and how to do it properly.
		Three things stood out to me though.
		First, I was wondering how to get the cheese up and out of the hopper to put away.
		It seems we don&apos;t take it up and out, but instead runt it down through, and catch it in a pan.
		That makes a lot more sense.
		Second, I was told to be careful when working around the sharp blades.
		When we first got the machine, we used thick gloves instead of caution.
		Those gloves looked pretty cumbersome.
		I won&apos;t get a chance to see just how cumbersome the gloves are though, as we don&apos;t use them any more.
		Third, i found what looked like black mould on the outside of the machine.
		I cleaned it off, but I won&apos;t know for sure if it was actually mould until tomorrow, if then.
		If takes a while to come back, it was probably mould, and we need to clean the machine better.
		I&apos;ll need to talk to the managers about making sure the thing is clean.
		If it&apos;s back tomorrow though, that&apos;s way too fast for mould growth.
		In that case, it was probably just burn food from the pizza pans, which get used repeatedly throughout the day and get inserted into the machine again after having been sent through the oven.
		I&apos;m hoping it was just burnt gunk.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the last couple hours of my shift, I didn&apos;t have to work the pizza dress station or do any management stuff.
		I just got sent to the other side of the oven, the landing station, to clean that down and take care of the pizzas that still came out of the oven every once in a while after the rush had ended.
		The head manager says I&apos;ve gotten good at running the pizza dress station over the past couple days.
		I&apos;m not so sure about that.
		Yesterday, I was overwhelmed, and today, I had help during all the bad parts.
		I think I could still use more practice.
		They said they&apos;re not worried about my ability to do the counts.
		I replied that the counts are easy, it&apos;s the pizza dress station that&apos;s the actual challenge.
		They agreed.
		They said I&apos;m ready to take on the job.
		I suppose maybe I am.
		I mean, I&apos;m not going to be the best shift leader if I start tomorrow.
		I need more practice with keeping track of everything while working and with moving people to where I need them.
		I can get that practice whether I have the title or not though, so it&apos;s not overly important that I get in the practice first.
		Finally, they said that they&apos;ve been pestering the person in charge to try to get them to administer my shift leader test, and they&apos;ll let me know when the person in charge lets them know when that&apos;ll happen.
		The person in charge really won&apos;t get back to you if you don&apos;t keep pestering them.
		I&apos;ve notice that when I&apos;ve tried to get them to do something I need them to as well.
		So the test will happen when it happens.
		It might be soon or it might not be.
		Either way is fine with me.

	<p>
		I didn&apos;t really do much in Minetest today, but I did plan and start to build an emergency items stash, which I&apos;ve put in the glitch chamber you end up in when the mine carts bug up.
		being so near the centre of the game world, that room seems like the ideal location for such a stash.
		I&apos;m not going to actually need that stash, but it&apos;s something to build and put supplies toward.
		In the chest, I&apos;m going to have one stack of each item that I&apos;d need to renew all renewable materials.
		The exception would be water buckets, which I&apos;ll need two of, and items that are interchangeable for the purposes of renewal, in which I&apos;ll have only a stack of one of the items.
		For example, I don&apos;t need both snow blocks and un-compacted snow to get pine saplings to spawn more snow.
		I only need one of the two, so I went with the blocks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Getting the needed stack of each type of mushroom spore will be a pain.
		Each spore type stacks up to 65535 items, which is a massively high amount to try to acquire.
		I&apos;m going to have have a lot of mushrooms I&apos;ll have to store by the time I have that many spores, too.
		It&apos;d be nice if mushrooms could be put toward something productive, even something basic such as being used as a weak furnace fuel, instead of just taking up storage space.
		Speaking of which, my saplings are taking up a lot of space, and I&apos;m considering starting to burn off my extras as fuel just to get them out of my hair.
