<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 70 grams of cereal and 119 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch and a snack, I had 590 grams and 268 grams of Aztec salad for lunch and a snack.
		For dinner, I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
		I also had 158 grams of pretzels.
	</p>
	<p>
		The quality of the produce selection at the store today was a bit different than usual.
		The tomatoes were much better than usual, but there were very few red or yellow bell peppers, and the ones available didn&apos;t look like they were worth buying.
		I ended up getting extra green ones for my next batch of salad instead.
		Theoretically, I should be eating sandwiches, not buying ingredients for more salad, as I&apos;m trying to clear out my freezer.
		The bread will keep though, being frozen, and it feels like it&apos;s been forever since I&apos;ve had this delicious salad.
		I think I&apos;m going to start bringing sandwiches to work instead of the salad for dinner though.
		It&apos;ll just be more filling when I need it to be.
		Having the salad for lunch and a sandwich for dinner&apos;s probably better than having the same thing for both meals anyway.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		The treatment today was much less painful than previously, though still quite unpleasant.
		I&apos;ve been literally crying during the treatments from all the pain, though I don&apos;t think the doctor sees it because of the eye covers I have to wear.
		This time though, I didn&apos;t get anywhere near tears.
	</p>
	<p>
		The doctor thinks I won&apos;t need a full treatment next time.
		They plan to do a spot treatment, which they say they&apos;ll provide at a reduced rate compared to a full treatment.
		That seems fine.
		I made sure to mention that I&apos;d like them to go over my full upper lip though.
		The pigment in my hair there was been drastically reduced by the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>, so you can&apos;t see it from a distance, but it&apos;s still there, and it&apos;s coarser than the rest of my hair.
		Elsewhere, I&apos;m still feeling stubble too, but it&apos;s less annoying because it isn&apos;t as coarse.
	</p>
	<p>
		My next appointment will be on September 17, at noon.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s been more than twenty-four hours now, and I&apos;ve seen no adverse effects on my chest from the home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>.
		I mean, there are the beginnings of ingrown hairs, but those happen every time I shave my chest.
		We are a go for home hair-removal treatment.
		I didn&apos;t think there&apos;d be a problem, but safety first.
		The instruction manual told me to do a spot test to be sure there wouldn&apos;t be problems, so that&apos;s what I did.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/08/20.png" alt="The entrance to Coffee Tower is in the underground mushroom garden" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I started work on Coffee Tower.
		I&apos;m calling it that to keep with the lack of sleep theme, but also because the purpose of the tower is to grind nodes into drops.
		Y&apos;know, like you&apos;d grind coffee beans before you filter water through them to make coffee, or whatever it is that you do to make the drink.
		I think that&apos;s what you do, but I&apos;m not actually a coffee drinker, so I haven&apos;t exactly done it before.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t know why, but I didn&apos;t think to use ladders to break my fall when I first discussed the possibility of building this tower.
		I can use the ladders just the same though.
		The idea was to fall while out of the waterfall, then dive into the waterfall near the bottom as I fell, slowing the fall.
		The same idea applies to the ladders though, with the added bonus that I don&apos;t risk drowning.
		Just fall in the column of air, then move into the nodes occupied by ladders to slow the fall gently to a stop.
		At the same time though, with the tower, it&apos;s less important to break the fall at all, when dealing with the tower instead of the mineshaft.
		With the mineshaft, I have to start at the top, make it down to where I need to build up from, then build up.
		Then of course, I dig back down, and have to make my way back up.
		With the tower though, assuming I don&apos;t finish the grinding in a single session, falling to the bottom puts my corpse and its inventory near my base.
		I don&apos;t have to go deep into the mineshaft to retrieve everything.
		Also with the tower, instead of going down, up, down, and back up, I just go up and down, one time.
		It takes much less effort.
	</p>
	<p>
		I built semi-fancy windows made of stairs and slabs into the part of the tower that&apos;s above ground, though that&apos;s not yet finished.
		Partly, the goal was to conserve materials; as even with the windows, I don&apos;t have nearly enough stone to get the tower as high as I&apos;d like it to be, though keeping the inside of the tower lit without torches was also a huge factor.
		The windows make the tower look much less terrible though.
		They sort of make it look like the tower was actually intended to look decent.
		Of course, I&apos;d prefer a decent-looking tower, but I sacrificed form for function for the most part on this project.
		If I&apos;d chosen a material other than stone, the tower would look nicer, but it would have to be cut even shorter, so I pretty much had to go with stone.

<section id="gender">
	<h2>Gender</h2>
	<p>
		I figured out today at work what I should have done about the customer that was trying to convince me to claim to be a man.
		I should have gotten my wallet out of my purse in the back and shown them my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		If they see that the state of Oregon says I&apos;m neither a man nor woman, it might have gotten them to stop arguing about it.
		I&apos;m not sure they would have accepted it, but they really wouldn&apos;t have had a leg to stand on.
