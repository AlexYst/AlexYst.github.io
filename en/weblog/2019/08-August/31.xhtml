<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 54 grams of cereal and 67 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had 191 grams of muffuletta and 22 potato nuggets.
		After realising how close the coming term was and that the school was probably going to make me miss it because of their idiocy, I ended up eating 90 grams of chocolate from the stress.
		For dinner, I had 430 grams of muffuletta.

<section id="sorting">
	<h2>File-sorting problem</h2>
	<p>
		Today, I tried upgrading <a href="/en/domains/bailey.local.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a> from Debian 9 to Debian 10 to try the source code fix on Debian 10.
		The goal was to rule out Debian as the problem, and be sure that the problem was PureOS-specific.
		Instead, what I found was that on Debian 10, my source code fix caused the same breakage as on PureOS.
		That meant that the problem was that in the newer software, my patch wasn&apos;t working, but in the older Debian 9 software, the patch worked just fine.
		So it was back to the drawing board.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried a new source code edit.
		Or I guess you could say I tried the original one.
		I&apos;d originally planned to copy the body of the <code>g_utf8_collate_key()</code> function over the body of the <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> function, as they take the same arguments, have the same return value types, and the return values are meant to be passed into the same sorting function.
		The only difference is that the differences in the return values are meant to cause differences in how the items get sorted.
		Doing it this way, the source once again compiled into a package, but this time, the package didn&apos;t seem to break anything.
		The solution isn&apos;t perfect, but does allow me to get the files sorted correctly in the file manager.
		The files just aren&apos;t sorted correctly in applications that use <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> but use its return value incorrectly.
		This fix works on both <code>bailey</code> -Debian 10 machine - and <a href="/en/domains/taylor.local.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a> - the PureOS 8 machine.
		It&apos;s worth noting that I installed Debian 10 with Xfce this time though, and <a href="apt:thunar">Thunar</a> enforces case sensitivity even with the fix and without any in-application way to turn that off.
		To fix that problem, you&apos;ve got to turn to the command line and run <kbd>xfconf-query --channel thunar --property /misc-case-sensitive --create --type bool --set false</kbd>.
		It&apos;s also worth noting that for some reason, when I installed <a href="apt:pbuilder"><code>pbuilder</code></a> on PureOS this time, it didn&apos;t demand or even ask that I specify a repository for it.
		I have no idea what&apos;s different this time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I estimated that I might get this problem solved in about a week more.
		That was two days ago.
		I underestimated just how far up the wall this obnoxious sorting method drives me and just how determined I would be to get this terrible feature patched out of my system.
		I really wish there was a configuration option for this.
		I shouldn&apos;t need to entirely patch it out of my system just to turn it off.
	<p>
	<p>
		Anyway, this patch isn&apos;t perfect.
		In particular, it doesn&apos;t enforce correct sorting, it just makes it so <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> doesn&apos;t add to the problem of incorrect sorting.
		What I&apos;d like to have this function do in the future is return specially-crafted collation keys that cause applications using <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> to sort files correctly even if they try to impose stupid things such as case insensitivity.
		This could be accomplished by converting each character into a hexadecimal pair, for example, in which the digits range from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;p&quot; instead of from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;f&quot;, for example.
		That way, everything is in lower case letters, and there is no punctuation, digits, or letter case for applications calling <code>g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()</code> to even worry about.
		I have no idea how to accomplish this in C, seeing as I don&apos;t know C, but it&apos;s something I&apos;d like to do in the future.
		I have no more determination to work on this for now though.
		With the fix mostly working at this point, and only a few image viewers left as the remaining applications I know that still refuse to sort my files correctly, I have other things that rank higher on my to-do list.
	</p>

<section id="battery">
	<h2>Mobile battery</h2>
	<p>
		My new mobile battery seems to be holding its power pretty well.
		I guess I need to downgrade the mobile soon.
		Not only does the upgraded version of the system not read the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card (meaning that I can&apos;t play my music on the device), but also, it doesn&apos;t seem to instantiate <code>iptables</code> correctly, so orWall complains.
		I imagine the issue causes data leaks, from the sound of it, so if I&apos;m going to put this thing on the network, I should downgrade to the system that actually will allow me to stop that leakage.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a side note, this whiteboard is really allowing me to see why I never appear to get anything done.
		I&apos;ve crossed so many items off my list, but I&apos;ve finally had to erase those crossed-out items to make room for me to add more items not yet done.
		Every time I seem to make progress, I end up with even more to do.
		I actually <strong>*am*</strong> getting things done, it just doesn&apos;t <strong>*feel*</strong> like it because my to-do list never gets much shorter.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I feel like I rushed my <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> self-treatment today, and didn&apos;t do as through of a job as I really should have.
		I spent all my time trying to debug this stupid file-sorting issue, and didn&apos;t have enough time left to get the hair-removal done properly.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		The term starts in four days, and the school still hasn&apos;t unlocked my account.
		They still haven&apos;t even said a word to me.
		I wrote a short and very angry letter to the school today:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The term starts in just four days.
			You still haven&apos;t taken the financial hold off my account even though you *CASHED THE TUITION CHEQUE I SENT*, and still haven&apos;t allowed me to re-register for the coming term.
			Are you seriously going to make me miss this term because of *YOUR* mistake?
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I need to prepare for the possibility of not being able to get any courses this term.
		If I have no courses, I&apos;ll stress out about the missed term.
		This is a fact.
		At this point though, if I get the term, I&apos;ll stress out about having not gotten the time to work on me that I&apos;m now expecting, as it doesn&apos;t seem that the school&apos;s going to fix their problem in time, given their outright horrible response time.
		I&apos;d would rather have the term though, so I can continue my progression.
		Either way, I&apos;ll be incredibly stressed out, but if I can get some courses this term, at least I&apos;ll get closer to finishing school and leaving this terrible university forever.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="snake">
	<h2>A snake on the path</h2>
	<p>
		I nearly ran over a garter snake on the path to work today, as I almost didn&apos;t see it in time and it was right in my trajectory.
		I think I swerved in time to miss the poor thing though.
		I really have nothing against snakes, and I&apos;d hate to injure the thing for no reason.
		Something as large as my bicycle and I would do a lot of damage to it, too.
		I examined the pavement after it fled, and couldn&apos;t find blood.
		I figured it&apos;d bleed if I ran over it, wouldn&apos;t it?
		I also hoped that the snake&apos;s ability to flee so fast at all was because it hadn&apos;t been injured.
		Now that I think back though, I should have felt a bit of a bump if I&apos;d actually run over it, so the snake should be completely fine.
	</p>

<section id="promotion">
	<h2>A promotion?</h2>
	<p>
		I arrived at work, and the head manager had me change into a black shirt; the uniform worn by management at our workplace.
		Everyone else has to wear orange.
		I&apos;ve never liked orange; it&apos;s such an ugly colour.
		It&apos;s probably my least-favourite of the common colours you see get used a lot.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my workmates said I looked spiffy, and I was glad I was rushing past them already, as I couldn&apos;t hold my smile for more than half a second, and didn&apos;t want to make a big deal of this.
		I mean seriously.
		I don&apos;t like turning things into a bigger deal than they are.
		Management keeps this place running, but they&apos;re treated like dirt by the owner just like everyone else.
		They&apos;re not appreciated for their contribution.
		Being promoted at this place isn&apos;t so much an improved rank to be sought, but instead just more responsibilities to take on with hardly any compensation for the added stress.
		I&apos;m taking this position for the experience though, and for what it&apos;ll allow me to add to my rÃ©sumÃ©.
		This is a stepping stone toward the possibility of something else.
		But it&apos;s true about spiffiness.
		Anyone would look spiffy in comparison after getting to change out of an ugly, orange teeshirt.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was told to take the manager test at home, due to the person-in-charge not having time to administer it themself.
		It seems easy to cheat that way, except that the head manager specifically said I was allowed to bring the packet with all the answers for the in-person test, so this really isn&apos;t any different.
		Simply copying the answers from the packet wouldn&apos;t be cheating by this logic.
		I&apos;d rather rely on memory though.
		I&apos;d rather have actually learned the stuff or fail from not having learned the stuff.
		It already feels like I practically have the job, wearing the black shirt though.
		I could still lose the promotion, but likely won&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what about the other shift-leader-in-training?
		Where is their black shirt?
		At first, I found myself thinking about how they&apos;re so much better than me at this.
		Why would I be the one to don the uniform first; the one that seems to be going to be promoted first?
		But then I remembered.
		This is probably a case of aptitude versus leadership.
		They&apos;re the better leader.
		That much I&apos;m completely convinced of.
		But between the two of us, I have more aptitude.
		I&apos;m picking things up faster.
		I wouldn&apos;t have even noticed, but they&apos;d mentioned to me before that they were having trouble.
		The head manager had to keep explaining how to perform certain management tasks, and they weren&apos;t getting it; tasks I&apos;d picked up the first time they were explained to me.
		The head manager has gone back and re-explained those tasks to me, but those refreshers weren&apos;t needed.
		They didn&apos;t check to see if I remembered, they didn&apos;t test my memory first, they just explained again.
		Being stoned doesn&apos;t help though.
		They admitted to me that they&apos;d been stoned out of their mind when the head manager was trying to explain stuff to them.
		If they head manager had known they were stoned, it would have made them seem unreliable, I think.
		But because they likely didn&apos;t know, it instead made them look very slow-minded or dim.
		Less capable than they&apos;d&apos;ve been if working with a clear head.
		I&apos;m pretty sure they&apos;d have all this down if they weren&apos;t on marijuana much of the time.
		In any case, I think that together, we have what it takes, even if separate, we don&apos;t yet.
		They&apos;ve got the leadership skills needed to run the show, while I&apos;m capable of handling all the paperwork and things like that.
		With time, we&apos;ll both be competent shift leaders separately though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tonight, as we were locking up the store to go home, the head manager gave me the alarm code.
		They said they&apos;d give that to me when I needed it, and I&apos;m not a shift leader yet.
		I don&apos;t need it yet.
		That aside, the code was way too easy to keep track of.
		I won&apos;t say why, as the code is confidential and I don&apos;t want to tell what it is online, but it doesn&apos;t seem like a secure code at all.
		They also said they&apos;d give me keys once they get the keys back from the former assistant manager, who has quit.
		This promotion really seems like it&apos;s going to happen for me.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I had a new idea for the Minetest progress mod I&apos;d so badly like to have.
		I&apos;ll need to restore the per-element level functionality I removed to make it work though.
		It&apos;s a fairly simple idea though.
		Basically, there are different types of warp point nodes, one for each element.
		Each time you gain a level in a particular element, you are given a warp point node that corresponds to that element.
		These nodes will look like some sort of post, probably with a cobble texture, with a floating, coloured cube hovering atop it.
		The cube will be turned, with a corner pointing up and another pointing down.
		I don&apos;t think that&apos;d be too difficult to build in Blender.
		The cobble texture will be the same colour for all warp points, but the colour of the cube will depend on which element the warp point corresponds with.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t want the warp points treated as disposable though.
		I mean, in theory, a player might get more than they think they need, and waste them, using them to warp out of a deep mine they never plan to go back to, for example.
		I want them to be treated with more respect than that, especially considering that each one that resides on the map has to keep its location and owner data in memory so it can be gotten back to from the other warp points.
		I thought about not allowing you to warp unless your inventory is empty, so you can work on distant builds, but still need to transport materials on foot.
		If you have to abandon your inventory to use them as one-way warp points, that would greatly discourage such use of them.
		However, warp points aren&apos;t very useful if you can&apos;t warp your stuff with you.
		Instead, I decided to have outgoing warps have a range based on how much of the appropriate element you&apos;ve deposited in them.
		That way, the more effort it would take to retrieve the warp point (in other words, the further out it is), the more effort you need to waste to abandon the warp point.
		That would be just about perfect.
		I thought about making the range thing affect both incoming and outgoing warps, but that&apos;d require storing the deposit counts in the main database instead of in the node metadata.
		As I mentioned a bit ago, I&apos;m pretty sure the mod&apos;s main database resides completely in memory at all times.
		Also, it would also make the sand warps useless if you use your sand to level up, so it&apos;d be a trade-off between having many low-range sand warps or few far-reaching sand warps.
		I&apos;d have to go with many far-reaching warps not for the warps, but for the progress and level involved.
		Without an incoming range requirement though, sand warps can act as anchors to draw you in, but not sent you out.
		I might actually disallow sand deposits over three nodes to enforce using them as incoming points.
		It&apos;d be fine because it would just go to show that sand is literally the worst element in the base game.
		Besides, outgoing warps are the important ones to have range, as you have to haul in a lot of the element before you can warp out of the area.
		Incoming points don&apos;t need to have as much effort poured into them, as you&apos;re headed toward them, not toward abandoning them.
		There&apos;s less for me to try to discourage when it comes to incoming warp points.
