	<h2>Setting up the laptop</h2>
	<p>
		I got my files transferred over, and <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> had been working since the day before yesterday.
		When I tried to set up <code>iptables</code> though, I lost my Internet access and had to revert the change.
		My best guess was that on PureOS, the user <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> runs as isn&apos;t <code>debian-tor</code>, as it&apos;s not on Debian.
		So I needed to figure out which user it was that I need to allow network access to.
		I checked the list of system users though, and <code>debian-tor</code> is on the list.
		If <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> wasn&apos;t being run as that user, I wasn&apos;t sure what user it would be run as, and why would that unused user be created in the first place?
		I could only assume that there was something else in my <code>iptables</code> configuration that works on the dying laptop but not on the new laptop.
		I started an account on the Purism forums and wrote up most of a post asking for help before I remembered what the problem was.
		PureBrowser, the default browser of PureOS, is very obviously a Firefox fork.
		I don&apos;t remember if I actually read that anywhere, but you can totally tell by both the main browsing interface and the configuration menu.
		Firefox has an annoying default when you set a proxy: it tries to resolve <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> names <strong>*outside the proxy*</strong>!
		Why in Squiddy&apos;s name would it do that by default!?
		But anyway, checking the checkbox that tells it that you do in fact want it to use the proxy for everything like you told it to fixed the problem.
		I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a way to get Firefox to respect the proxy when it comes to bug reports though, so basically, Firefox attempts to send all bug reports over an insecure channel, and the reports end up blocked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, this laptop&apos;s mouse is a huge pain in the neck.
		The touchpad itself <strong>*is*</strong> the left mouse button, so to click and drag, you have to hold the touchpad down and drag your finger across the touchpad.
		That doesn&apos;t sound bad on paper, but the extra pressure from holding the touchpad down means that your finger drags unplesantly across the touchpad, and with much friction.
		Also, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a right mouse button at all.
		You have to use the touch control of double tapping with two fingers.
		I&apos;m not sure how I can possibly play Minetest on this mess.
		It often takes both hands to properly use the mouse, and that&apos;s ridiculously cumbersome.
	</p>
	<p>
		Already, I&apos;m finding broken settings on this system too.
		For example, there&apos;s one that says it&apos;ll give you an application menu with your applications categorised.
		If you turn it on, the system finds that it won&apos;t work, and it takes away your main applications menu, so you get no applications menu.
		And now that they system realises that the setting is broken, you can no longer toggle it.
		Another setting simply turns off the presence of the applications menu.
		That seems to be its intended purpose.
		But once you turn it off, turning it back on doesn&apos;t bring back the menu.
		I tried deleting all the configuration files using the graphical file manager and restarting, but I think the <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> re-saved the relevant files from <abbr title="random-access memory">RAM</abbr>, so I didn&apos;t get my application menu back.
		I ended up needing to log out of the desktop by restarting the machine (there doesn&apos;t seem to be the option to simply log out and leave the machine on to log in again later) and logging in via <code>tty2</code>.
		(<code>tty1</code> seems to be the main <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> instead of the usual <code>tty7</code>, and <code>tty7</code> just isn&apos;t usable.)
		From <code>tty2</code>, I could delete all the configuration files and start fresh without them coming back from <abbr title="random-access memory">RAM</abbr>, as the <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> config files aren&apos;t used by command line interfaces.
	</p>
	<p>
		This system uses stupid <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr>, which uses a file manager unable to properly sort filenames.
		I&apos;m going to need to ask about this on the forum and see if they have a solution.
		They won&apos;t.
		I&apos;ve been looking for a solution for over a decade, if I recall, and no one seems to have a solution that allows the disabling of this intentionally-programmed yet highly-aggravating &quot;feature&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess my migration is mostly complete.
		I need to get <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> set up properly so I can compile my website properly, but that&apos;s about it.

<section id="promotion">
	<h2>A promotion?</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager finally got around to training me on the hard stuff today.
		Basically, as a shift leader, I&apos;d be expected to run things, which in part means running the the pizza dress station, which sort of acts as command central, while also keeping track of what&apos;s going on in the store and moving employees around as needed.
		I used to work the pizza dress station every once in a while, years ago, but things really have changed since then.
		It used to be a three-person station, and business was slower.
		Now, business has really picked up, and there&apos;s often only one person on the station, as two of them have been replaced by a machine.
		While working there; I&apos;ve got to man the telephones, run the machine, take orders that come through the Internet, make custom orders that have come through both the Internet and the telephone, keep track of what the people at the other side of the oven have yelled over for me to throw into the oven, and continually throw in a stream of our top-selling pizza; which sells too quickly for it to be worth calling over to me.
		My attention is being pulled in at least six different directions, and often, I was only able to keep track of about three or four at once, neglecting two or three of those responsibilities for several moments until I remembered they needed my attention too.
		And I wasn&apos;t even in charge of moving people around.
		I didn&apos;t need to keep track of the whole store, which would have been several other directions my attention would be pulled.
	</p>
	<p>
		I expected some hands-on training today, but that&apos;s not what happened.
		That&apos;s not what <strong>*needed*</strong> to happen.
		Instead, the head manager pretty much just put me on the station alone for stretches of time, with someone else (sometimes the head manager themself) coming by and helping for a while.
		I was pretty much just thrown in and expected to swim.
		It sounds like a bad way to train, but it was the only way I&apos;d see how the station actually gets run; and I already knew how to perform any of those tasks individually.
		If they stayed with me and helped me, i wouldn&apos;t see how hectic the station is and what I&apos;d have to deal with.
		It was awful though.
		I&apos;m not looking forward to having to deal with this garbage.
		The one thing that will let me keep my sanity is that the head manager always reserves this station for themself.
		That means that if they&apos;re on the clock, which is five days a week, I&apos;m not going to be the one dealing with all this.
		Most of the time, I won&apos;t have to do this more than twice per week after I&apos;ve finished training, and I might not even have to deal with it that often, as I won&apos;t be the only shift leader.
		It&apos;s no wonder the head manager is such an uncaring person though.
		They no doubt don&apos;t have the energy to be empathetic while dealing with all this garbage.
		Even if I don&apos;t end up becoming a shift leader after all, I feel like getting a chance to walk in their shoes a bit has been and will be (they say I&apos;ll b doing it again tomorrow, and I have a longer shift then) an eye-opening experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I said, they had to throw me in the deep end.
		Their doing that wasn&apos;t a problem.
		My one complaint about their behaviour today was that they got a bit over-controlling about writing instruments.
		I needed to write down an order from the Internet, and the boss had five pend sitting on the table near them.
		I grabbed one of them, and they took it back.
		The thing you need to understand too is that these were just basic pans, nothing special, and they didn&apos;t even belong to the head manager.
		They were just pens used by everyone in the store.
		But the head manager insisted I use the pencil that was already sitting near the ticket pad.
		I hate writing in pencil when I don&apos;t have a good reason to.
		I don&apos;t like how they feel when they write.
		And I didn&apos;t have a good reason to use one.
		We don&apos;t erase things from the order tickets, so I didn&apos;t need to write in an erasable medium, and we don&apos;t even have some stupid policy in place that says we have to write the tickets in pencil.
		No one in the store uses pencils to write the tickets hardly ever.
		In fact, while we have at least a dozen pens floating around the store, we have only two or three pencils.
		There was no good reason for it, it slowed me down to switch writing implements, and added a bit of unnecessary stress to the already-stressful situation.
		From there, the next time the head manager was away, I grabbed two pens.
		One, I put over near the pad to use as needed.
		The other, I slipped into my pocket out of fear the head manager would jack the one I put near the pad.
		And sure enough, when they noticed it, they took it away.
		Seriously, what was up with that?
		What was their problem with just letting me use a squid-damn pen!?

	<h2>A mantis encounter</h2>
	<p>
		I stopped at the grocery store to pick up some ingredients I need for a custom pizza.
		I haven&apos;t made a pizza for myself in quite a while.
		I needed dairy-free cheese and seaweed, and I&apos;ll add other ingredients from work.
		As soon as I took off my bicycle helmet, I felt a large, flying insect thwack into my hat, which I&apos;d been wearing beneath the helmet.
		I saw the thing fall, having stunned itself on my head, and I looked down.
		A mantis had landed on my shoe!
		I haven&apos;t seen one of these things in years.
		I&apos;ve probably seen less than a dozen of them in my lifetime.
		The Internet says they&apos;re not all that rare, but clearly, they keep themselves well-hidden most of the time.
		It&apos;s always fun to see one of these funny-looking critters.
	</p>
	<p>
		I remember the first time I encountered one of these insects though.
		I was a small child, and one showed up in the sandbox in my back yard.
		I had no clue what it was, and just knew that a huge, weird-looking bug with sizeable claws had made an appearance.
		Needless to say, I was pretty scared, so I ran to get an adult.
		My father always worked during the day, so I got Summer instead, and she explained that it was just a mantis, and that mantises are harmless.
		Since then though, I&apos;ve enjoyed the rare cases in which I&apos;ve gotten to see one, as it doesn&apos;t happen too often.
		Summer may have a lot of issues, but one of her good qualities is that she tends not to freak out about critters that are known not to be dangerous like some people do.
		Catching frogs, snakes, and insects was just something she raised us to be okay doing.
		If it doesn&apos;t pose a threat and doesn&apos;t cause any pain, it&apos;s not something to be dreaded or feared.
		(Unless it&apos;s the type of thing that invades your home and causes problems, such as pantry moths that get into all your food; then you dread it, but try to eliminate it instead of fearing it.)
