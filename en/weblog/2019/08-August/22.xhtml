<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 55 grams of cereal and 116 grams of soy milk.
		Today was too stressful, and I ended up not making lunch, instead eating 199 grams of pretzels.
		For dinner, I had 441 grams of Aztec salad.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="errands">
	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve added a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> mouse to the list of things I need to get.
		I&apos;m not going to want to mess with the new laptop&apos;s mouse buttons in ways that might harm them.
		I only did that on my dying laptop because the mouse buttons were already having problems at that point.
		Instead, when I grind while away from the keyboard on the new laptop, I&apos;m going to want to plug in a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> mouse that has both the right and left buttons taped down.
	</p>
	<p>
		I checked two different second hand stores today.
		The first had slippers.
		They were a bit small, but they&apos;ll do for now.
		That store didn&apos;t have the mouse though, or more importantly, the whiteboard.
		The second store had a whiteboard that designed to be hung on the wall, but with some slight modification, I thought I could make it work.
		Still no mice though.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way home, I made a stop at the bike shop to pick up tire patches.
		There, when I tried to lock up my bike, I found that my bike key was missing.
		If you recall, I dropped my keys on the pavement a while back, and the loop on the bike key shattered.
		I learned the hard way that the key didn&apos;t have any metal in the loop, and head of the key was just made from weak plastic.
		I tried super gluing the key back together, and it didn&apos;t hold long.
		I didn&apos;t drop the keys again, but having them in my pocket put too much stress on the weakened loop.
		I don&apos;t think I mentioned it, but I tried gluing it a second time, and it predictably broke again just as quickly.
		I asked the bike shop for their advice, and they said a locksmith could duplicate the key if I had the spare.
		I explained that it wasn&apos;t a normal key, but instead a strange, thick key with sloped cuts out of the corner.
		They still thought the locksmith could duplicate it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sceptically, I headed home for the spare, then to the locksmith, where they confirmed that they&apos;re unable to copy such keys.
		The bike shop person was wrong.
		I, who knows nothing about bike locks, could tell right away that copying this key wasn&apos;t an option.
		That just show how little the bike shop employee knew what they were talking about, which isn&apos;t reassuring.
		The locksmith claimed it was a &quot;security feature&quot; of the locks, that no blanks to make copies with are in circulation.
		The lock company doesn&apos;t release blanks and that somehow prevents the crooks from making keys they shouldn&apos;t have.
		But of course, to copy a key, they&apos;d need an existing copy, and if they have that, they aren&apos;t going to copy the key.
		They&apos;re just going to steal the bike.
		This policy doesn&apos;t provide any security whatsoever.
		If they&apos;re not going to allow the keys to be copied too, they shouldn&apos;t make them so flimsy and weak.
		Just provide keys with a metal loop, just like a standard house key has.
		Just like just about every key has, to be honest.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="key">
	<h2>Broken key</h2>
	<p>
		I tried going to the lock manufacture&apos;s website, where supposedly, I can claim one set of gratis replacement keys and buy more keys after that.
		It&apos;s really sucky that you&apos;ve got to buy more keys just because the keys were made so stupidly weak, not because you were careless and misplaced them or something.
		The instructions there said that claiming the keys requires submitting a support ticket with a written description of the problem, so I wrote:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			A while back, I dropped my keys on the pavement.
			Frustratingly, I found out that my Kryptonite key didn&apos;t have any metal it the top of the key.
			It was pure plastic, and it shattered on impact.
			I tried super gluing the key back together, but that didn&apos;t hold long, and I resorted to carrying the key in a pocket of my purse, which has been really inconvenient.
			Today though, while I was out, I managed to drop the key somewhere.
			That&apos;s the real trouble with broken keys: they can&apos;t be kept on your keyring, and are way too easy to lose.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyway, I still have the original packaging of the lock and the instruction page, and instruction page says the first set of replacement keys is gratis.
			Can I get those replacement keys?
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, for the next time I need to buy a bike lock, do you have any locks that come with real, solid-metal keys instead of these easily-broken plastic-topped keys?
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Overly detailed and a bit snarky?
		Probably.
		I&apos;m kind of ticked off though.
		Submitting the form required me to fill out five Google <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>s, which was annoying, but they usually hit me with dozens of <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>s, so only five wasn&apos;t many, all things considered.
		The lock company&apos;s automated message said that they&apos;ll get back to me within ten business days, which would be fourteen actual days.
		It also said they&apos;ve got a high volume of tickets right now, so I&apos;m guessing they won&apos;t actually meet their quoted response time.
		Still, I&apos;ve marked it on the calendar so I know about when to try to contact them again.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I arrived home form the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, I noticed something hard in my pocket, I pulled it out to see what it was.
		I didn&apos;t remember putting anything in there.
		It was the broken key I&apos;d lost!
		I checked all four of my pockets almost a dozen times, if not more.
		There was a fifth pocket though that I&apos;d somehow missed: one of those tiny pockets that&apos;s inside a larger pocket.
		Y&apos;know, the tiny one no one uses any more that&apos;s meant to hold a pocket watch.
		You&apos;d think I&apos;d have felt the key in there at least one of the several times I patted myself down, but I guess I patted too low or something.
		Anyway, I&apos;m not telling the lock company that.
		The key is still broken, making it easy to lose because I can&apos;t keep it on a keyring, and the price of the lock included a spare set of keys anyway.
		I still want them to send the things.
	</p>

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been having trouble with the school continually telling me I need to pay my tuition, even though I keep telling them that I&apos;ve sent in my payment, and they just need to wait for the mail.
		This happens every term.
		Then send me notification that it&apos;s time to pay tuition, I send in my payment, and within a week, they start sending me notices that I really should have paid my tuition by now.
		First of all, they have no patience.
		Second of all, if they want the payment to arrive sooner, they should send notification that they are now accepting payments sooner.
		Give us students two or three week&apos;s worth of notice that you want the payment, not just one week, and expect us to magically get the payment to you in that time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, the messages from the school appear to be coming from my program advisor.
		I don&apos;t think they actually are, as they look more like automated messages, but they bear the advisor&apos;s name and come form the advisor&apos;s email address, so replies end up sent to the advisor.
		To further my suspicion that they don&apos;t come from the advisor, the messages keep coming even as the advisor and I talk about the fact that I&apos;ve already sent the payment.
		One of the last letters the advisor actually sent though said that they hoped my exam period had been stress-free.
		I said they weren&apos;t stress-free, but that I though I did alright on them.
		I thought that&apos;d be the end of that line of thought.
		Apparently, it wasn&apos;t.
		Today, the advisor asked why they weren&apos;t stress-free.
		So I wrote the following:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Dear <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			The school didn&apos;t like my coursework archive on my website a while back, and instead of first just politely asking me to take it down (I didn&apos;t even realise it was against the rules to have that archive, and from the wording of the letter, it seemed clear that the school knew I wasn&apos;t intending to cause any trouble), they jumped right to *threatening me* and demanding that I take it down.
			When I complied, and told them I complied, I never heard back about the issue.
			They never even wrote to say that they were acknowledging the compliance and were no longer holding threats against me.
			The stress caused by the threats made me *literally ill*, and I spent a few days in bed with killer headaches from it.
			There was absolutely no excuse for the school&apos;s behaviour.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyway, this event has totally drained the joy of studying the material at this school.
			I used to enjoy my time here, but now, everything I do here is stressful.
			During this past year or so since the event, school has become my most dreaded chore.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are things that can be majorly improved upon for future students, but the school isn&apos;t going to care enough to take any action.
			For example, the school could actually try talking to people in a civil manner first instead of jumping right to threats.
			At this point though, the damage is done for me.
			It&apos;s not going to be possible for anything at this school not to be stressful for me unless the censorship of my website by the school is ended and I&apos;m allowed to speak freely again.
			And the school isn&apos;t going to do that either.
			The weekly assignments are going to continue to be very stressful for me, and the final exams are going to be just as stressful.
			There&apos;s nothing either of us can do about that.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for your concern though.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kind regards,<br/>
			~ Alex Yst

	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I might get in so much trouble for that letter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later in the day, the payments office wrote to inform me that because I haven&apos;t paid, even though I&apos;ve sent the school a copy of the cheque stub so they know that I have in fact sent the payment, they&apos;ve cancelled my course registration for next term.
		So this is even more stress to deal with.
		They say after I&apos;ve paid, I can re-register during the late registration period.
		Last time I registered late, which was only because my program advisor waited until the last minute to get back to me about registration issues that I asked for help on on the first day of the registration period, the main course I was trying to get into filled up, and I wasn&apos;t allowed to take that course that term.
		So now that&apos;s going to happen again.
		I predict that I won&apos;t be able to get into at least one of the courses I&apos;m trying to, and I&apos;ll have to pick a different one.
		My response to the school:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Dear payments office,
		</p>
		<p>
			I&apos;ve already sent my payment via post.
			I&apos;m not sure why it hasn&apos;t arrived yet.
			I sent it as soon as you requested the payment the first time.
			I&apos;ve also sent a copy of the cashier&apos;s cheque stub to <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>, and I think <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> forwarded the stub to you.
			I can&apos;t make the mail arrive any faster.
			As you should already know the payment is coming, it&apos;s really not nice to cancel my registration on me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Best regards,<br/>
			~ Alex Yst

	<p>
		I didn&apos;t really have time to do anything in Minetest today.
		I left my laptop grinding for me while I took care of other things though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Coffee Tower is way too short to be practical for now.
		It&apos;s going to be a while before I can stack much to be ground.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="laptop">
	<h2>Laptop setup</h2>
	<p>
		There was too much going on today, and there wasn&apos;t time to finish setting up the laptop.
		I would have had time despite it all if I&apos;d skipped making the Aztec salad, but I&apos;ve put that off for too many days already, and I&apos;m not sure how long the ingredients will stay fresh.
		I had to get that made.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="path">
	<h2>Closed path</h2>
	<p>
		About a month ago, I ran into a roadblock on the bike path.
		There was construction.
		Since then, I haven&apos;t deviated my course, instead opting to hit that roadblock every week and have to take the posted detour route, because I&apos;ve wanted to know when the path is finally available for use.
		There have been some posted signs with information, but they&apos;ve all been in inconvenient locations, such as <strong>*beyond the actual roadblock*</strong>, where you can&apos;t read it without going where you&apos;re not allowed to go, or facing backwards from the direction I head at the top of an uphill path.
		Today, I spotted a new sign, one that wasn&apos;t there last week.
		It was just past the bridge that you shouldn&apos;t take if you&apos;re trying to avoid the closed path with out either going way out of the way or backtracking.
		There should be one on the other side of the bridge too, so people don&apos;t cross the bridge and have to immediately recross to go back to the side of the river with an open path.
		But being in a more-convenient-to-read location, I took a look to see if there was an estimation for how long the construction would take.
		As it turns out, the plan is to keep the path closed for the next two years.
		It&apos;s not going to open any time soon.
		I guess I&apos;ll stop trying to take this path for now.
		I&apos;ll probably forget to check back in two years though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="EUGLUG">
	<h2><abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting</h2>
	<p>
		I arrived at our usual meeting place only to find a notice saying the meeting was moved to some brewing company this week.
		I asked for directions, and though I followed them as best I could remember, I wasn&apos;t sure I was even headed the right way.
		I had to take the express way too, so there wasn&apos;t really a chance to ask anyone if I was headed in the right direction.
		Eventually, I noticed a landmark I was told I was supposed to see though, so I knew I was close.
		Soon, I found the brewing company, which had three large buildings, but none seemed to be open to the public.
		At that point, I nearly gave up and went home.
		After having put in all the effort though, I really wanted to make an appearance.
		I&apos;d put on my <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> tee-shirt just for the night, and I just wanted to actually make it to the meeting.
		I found a local arcade across the street though, so I asked there if the brewing company had another location in the city that might be open to the public.
		I figured it&apos;d be across town in the direction I&apos;d come from, with my luck, but it was actually just a few blocks away.
		Finally, I made it to the meeting, though about an hour late.
		I was too exhausted to work on typing up recipes though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I felt like I&apos;d overeaten before I left for the meeting, but as I rode down the express way, I knew making it as far as I was going to have to wouldn&apos;t have been easy if I hadn&apos;t had the extra fuel to back up the trip.
		It worked out fine this time.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="progress">
	<h2>Progress made today</h2>
	<p>
		At first, I felt like I hadn&apos;t made any progress today.
		I&apos;ve had too many setbacks.
		But after thinking about it, I&apos;ve gotten enough done.
		The important thing is that I got that whiteboard and got my remaining goals for the break written on it.
		With that, I have an organised visual list of what needs to get done, so I can pick things off one by one.
		Honestly, getting the whiteboard was probably the most-pressing thing on my disorganised to-do list in the margins of my calendar.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cancelled term registration was a major setback though, and if it doesn&apos;t get fixed in time, it&apos;s going to slow down my school progress.
		This issue has called my attention to an important fact though.
		I thought I was mainly waiting on vocal lessons.
		I thought that was the only thing that really stood in the way, and that moving forward was solely impeded by the lack of lessons.
		Everything else I&apos;ve been doing has been small stuff that doesn&apos;t get me very far, but is better than not moving forward at all.
		But no.
		Moving forward also depends on getting my schooling done.
		I can&apos;t let myself forget that again.
		That said, it&apos;s not like I&apos;ve been slowing down on my coursework.
		I haven&apos;t been putting off schooling, but remembering that I&apos;m actually making decent progress by simply getting my coursework turned in on time should raise my morale.
