	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I had a new idea for <code>alchemy2</code> today.
		Basically, I want to provide renewability for everything one might use up while not actually changing the rarity of in-game materials or (more importantly) causing redundancy if these materials ever become renewable in future Minetest Game versions.
		So how will I do it?
		The idea is simple.
		I need to define new materials that serve the same functions as the ones available in finite quantities, but make them made from the abomination life forms the mod provides.
		Initially getting these plants and fungi species will require using up finite materials - at least for some of them - but then you can use these materials instead of the finite ones to avoid depleting what rare resources you have.
		It should be interesting trying t figure out how I can define a crafting recipe for furnaces or something stone-like from plant parts from only three trees.
		Keep in mind that stone used to not be renewable, so for the initial version of this mod, a way to build furnaces and perhaps stone tools will need to be imagined.
		I guess the sand-based trees might be a good place to start, as sand-trees are closer to being made of stone than coal-trees or iron-trees, especially because I&apos;ve already planned both to mostly be wooden, with only flourishes of the lump material embedded in different ways.
		The sand-trees, which will probably grow from &quot;saplinds&quot;, will likely be kind of like living stone though.
