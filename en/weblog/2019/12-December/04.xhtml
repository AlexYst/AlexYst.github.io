	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		The school sent me four emails today about my registration requests being accepted; two emails for each of two courses.
		As the emails state though, these courses are to begin on 2019-11-14.
		In other words, they&apos;ve already started.
		Why is the school emailing me about them <strong>*now*</strong>?
		And for that matter, they already emailed me about these course just before the term began.
		They&apos;ve already sent this  information.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve managed to cobble together enough code to get <code>liblevelup</code> working in Minetest 0.4.0, this time, from within <code>liblevelup</code> itself, and not by messing with the engine&apos;s built-in Lua scripts.
		I did have to put added code in both of <code>liblevelup</code>&apos;s Lua files even though I was hoping not to put any in the one that doesn&apos;t define the main <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>, but that seemed to be the only way to prevent <code>liblevelup</code> from counting a lot of garbage I need it not to, such as how much cobble gets mined.
		That stat seems benign but useless, but all stats factor into the total player level, so any bad stat artificially increases the total level.
	</p>
	<p>
		My next step will be figuring out how to deal with world-mapping.
		The old mapper doesn&apos;t allow for boundaries to be specified, beyond which nodes aren&apos;t drawn, nor does the Minetest engine allow a boundary to be specified beyond which chunks won&apos;t generate.
		Should I just allow the map to extend as far as it will?
		Should I use the new mapper instead of the one that goes with the old game version?
		Probably the latter is the better option, honestly.
	</p>
	<p>
		I figured out the issue with being spawned in solid stone on one instance of the map with my chosen seed and not with another.
		The game was spawning me at (0, 0, 0) every time on one day but not on another day.
		Today, it&apos;s back to allowing me to spawn away from that point.
		What a bizarre bug.
		When I noticed I was spawning with zeroed-out coordinates every time, I assumed this old version of the game didn&apos;t yet offer better spawn point positioning and didn&apos;t yet randomly place players within a short distance form the origin instead of directly at the origin.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also did some exploring around, and it seems like the world is just one big desert, with patches of non-desert.
		They&apos;re sort of like oases, but most of them lack water.
		I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s up with the desert though.
		Most of it has no sand, and it&apos;s just a big, red, stone area.
		Is this what Minetest 0.4.0 was always like?
		Mostly bare desert stone?
	</p>

<section id="tires">
	<h2>Tires</h2>
	<p>
		Alright, I&apos;ve confirmed it.
		Both my tires are definitely having problems holding air.
		At some point, I&apos;ll work up the energy to swap out the inner tubes.
		Again.
		In the mean time, I&apos;m forced to reinflate at least one of the two every day or two.
		I can&apos;t just leave them flat and still get where I need to go, so that&apos;s mandatory arm exercise that I&apos;ve been getting in and haven&apos;t be able to put off like the tube replacement.
