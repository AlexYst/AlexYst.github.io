<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I worked on setting <code>liblevelup</code> to handle Minetest 0.4.0.
		It&apos;s not quite ready yet, but it no longer crashes the game as soon as the game starts.
		That&apos;s progress.
		I&apos;m pretty sure it doesn&apos;t actually count any drops though.
		Last time I did this, I found that there was no <code>minetest.handle_node_drops()</code> in 0.4.0&apos;s <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>, which would still be the case.
		With that function not existing, it doesn&apos;t get called by the engine, so drops aren&apos;t tracked.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been thinking about the results of merging elements at work, and I feel like I made some good progress on that today, but none of those ideas will be relevant until after I have <code>liblevelup</code> even just functioning on such an old version of the engine.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think I might base the first four elements&apos; combined forms on Minimal instead of Minetest Game.
		Minimal has graphics form an older time, before the modding <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> had been added.
		Additionally, the graphics didn&apos;t change much between 0.4.0 and 0.4.5, when crystal mese was added.
		The mese-based combinations will embody that time period well enough.
		What got me thinking about this though was the <code>experimental</code> mod from Minimal.
		There are some things from there I might like to incorporate into the sand-based combinations.

<section id="productivity">
	<h2>Productivity</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the franchise owner wants everyone working harder.
		They&apos;ve increased their productivity demands, saying they want us earning $60 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per hour per on-the-clock employee.
		That&apos;s going to be tough.
		A bit after the head manager told us that, they came over to me and said kind of quietly: &quot;Even though I was looking at you, I was talking to everyone. You&apos;re probably the least I have to worry about.&quot;.
		Huh.
		I hadn&apos;t even noticed that they were specifically looking at me, so I hadn&apos;t thought to take it as an attack on my own productivity.
		It&apos;s nice to know they see that I try to keep busy though.
		I&apos;m not as good at delegating as I should be, but I don&apos;t slack off, and I try to get as much done myself as I can.
		I did that before I became a shift leader too though.
		If I can learn to tell people what to do, and more importantly, learn <strong>*when*</strong> assigning tasks will help things run smoothly, I should be able to help us meet the new goal assigned to us.
