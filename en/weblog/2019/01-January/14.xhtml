<section id="pens">
	<h2>Pens</h2>
	<p>
		This pen set I bought supposedly had a variety of different pen types: 16 glitter, 12 metallic, 12 pastel, 10 fluorescent, 6 neon, and 4 standard.
		Previously, I tried to figure out which pens where which, but there wasn&apos;t a good way to tell.
		For example, there seemed to be eleven pens with metallic caps.
		So which pen&apos;s the twelfth metallic pen?
		There&apos;s also twelve pens with glittered shafts and glittered caps, one pen with a glittered cap but not a glittered shaft, and one of the pens with a metallic cap has a glittered shaft.
		At most, that&apos;s fourteen glitter pens, but that removes one of the accounted-for metallic pens.
		Which are the other two of three glitter pens?
		The &quot;pastels&quot;, &quot;fluorescents&qout;, and &quot;normals&quot; are pretty much the same, aside from how close to white they are and how much their colour pops, and have similar caps.
		Between the three types, there should be twenty-six, yet there are nineteen instead.
		I figured clearly, the pen bodies aren&apos;t as well-matched to the ink as they should be.
		There are also the six swirl pens.
		As there are six of them and there are supposed to be exactly six neon pens, I assumed originally that the swirl pens were just being called neon pens by the order page.
	</p>
	<p>
		I noticed today though that a high number of the supposedly-non-glitter pens looked glittery.
		In fact, aside from the pastel, normal, and swirl pens I&apos;d used, I thought I could only remember having used glittery pens.
		So I took every pen out and scribbled a little.
		It turns out that almost half of these are glitter pens.
		All nineteen of the normal/pastel/fluorescent pens are normal/pastel/fluorescent.
		The pen with the metallic cap and glittered shaft is a glitter pen, not a metallic pen.
		I didn&apos;t test the swirl pens, but they&apos;re just swirl pens.
		I&apos;ve used them all before, and they&apos;re neither glittered nor metallic.
		Every single other pen in the set is glittery.
		So the real pen inventory is composed of 25 glitter, 19 normal/pastel/fluorescent (probably 5 normal, 11 pastel and 3 neon, if I&apos;d have to judge), 10 metallic, and 6 swirl.
		I don&apos;t know where the company selling these got their numbers, but they&apos;re clearly very wrong.
		None of them remotely add up, with the possible exception of the swirl pens being &quot;neon&quot;.
		I&apos;m not picky about the ratios between pen types, but it would&apos;ve been nice if the site had given correct numbers.
		It&apos;d&apos;ve saved me a lot of time trying to figure out which pens were which.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that I take a closer look at the photo online, I see the pens don&apos;t match what was actually sent to me, either.
		For example, the image shows five shades of brown and a tan.
		What was actually sent to me includes no browns or tans of any sort.

<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		The first job that caught my eye online was that of a mail-handler assistant.
		It pays sixteen dollars an hour, which is more than I&apos;m making now, and doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;d be too difficult.
		It&apos;s not my dream job or anything, but mainly I just need a job to work for a couple years while I finish my bachelor degree.
		The post office isn&apos;t going away any time soon, so it seemed like a stable, reliable job.
		It turns out not so much though.
		According to the description, the job is temporary and guaranteed not to last longer than 360 days.
		I&apos;d be guaranteed not to keep the job even a full year, no matter how well I performed.
		I&apos;ll pass.
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up reworking my résumé a bit before applying for a position at a grocery store.
		I&apos;d made a mistake in my hire date for my current job, and added a couple other things as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		I could&apos;ve gotten a lot more done, I think, but this break is not only my chance to apply for jobs, but also my chance to unwind from last term.
		I think I;m going to take it a bit slower than originally planned.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="drawing">
	<h2>Drawing</h2>
	<p>
		I mentioned previously that I intended to buy a used pencil case for taking some of my pens to work, but I ended up not doing that.
		Instead, I&apos;ve been taking a small number of pens that fits in my wallet.
		I decide what I&apos;ll draw before heading in, then take only the pens I need.
		Now that I won&apos;t be working on only single drawings per day though, it&apos;s hard to know what pens I&apos;ll want.
		So before work, this time, I did stop into the second-hand store to look for a pencil case.
		None were available, so I bought a mid-sized water battle for under a dollar.
		It&apos;ll keep the pens from getting broken if my bag gets hit, but it&apos;s larger than ideal and a bit cumbersome to get pens out of.
