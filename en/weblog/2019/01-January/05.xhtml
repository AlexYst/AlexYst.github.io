	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		Due to no one posting in the discussion forums, my responses were delayed again today.
		I have gotten a decent amount of the reading done already though.
		I&apos;ve also got two days off from work just before I need to have the material read by, so I&apos;m by no means behind.
		This week should go smoother than I&apos;d originally anticipated.
		If I can get done quickly enough though, so I have one or both those days completely off, I wouldn&apos;t mind taking a trip to see if the recycling centre has a working scanner.

	<h2>Drawing</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m excited about my new pens, so I&apos;ve started drawing again while I wait for them to arrive.
		I&apos;ve by no means aver been even close to a good artist, but yesterday, I managed a rather decent line drawing of grape vines.
		I don&apos;t know what kind of leaves I put on them, but they definitely weren&apos;t grape leaves.
		Anyway, I tried my hand at drawing a flower today, and the results were rather dismal; more the poor art quality I&apos;ve come to expect from myself.
		I think I&apos;ve learned how to get decent results from these two experiments though.
		The trick is that I can draw small, ornate things without much detail, and they come out fine.
		I think.
		These small things then <strong>*are*</strong> the detail of the greater image, as I repeat similar patterns across the larger image.
		However, I lack the skill needed to draw large things.
		I think the problem is that I can do decent outlines, but I can&apos;t make decent filler textures.
		Until I find time to learn how to make larger items look good, I should stick to small items.
