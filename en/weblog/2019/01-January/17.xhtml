<section id="scanner">
	<h2>Scanner</h2>
	<p>
		The scanner&apos;s not getting colours right for non-pastel pens either.
		Neon orange and neon pink barely show up in the image at all, and a normal green comes through as cyan.
		The scanner&apos;s pretty much only going to work for black pen drawings.
		Disappointing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found the cause of the scanner refusing to make a second scan though.
		When asking for an image to be imported from the scanner, the scanner dialogue window pops up.
		After telling the scanner to to scan using this window, the window drops down beneath other windows, but stays open and running.
		It&apos;s tying up the scanner, so a new dialogue window for the scanner won&apos;t pop up because the scanner is &quot;busy&quot;.
		This window can be closed or reused though, either of which fixes the problem.
		There&apos;s no reason for the dialogue box to drop below the other windows after the scan, so I didn&apos;t notice it was doing that instead of just closing.

<section id="water">
	<h2>Water</h2>
	<p>
		I went to use the sink today and found I had no running water.
		I tried the other sink and the bathtub, and the pipes seemed to just be empty.
		I started getting dressed to go notify the manager.
		I figured I&apos;d let them know, and in the process, probably figure out whether it was my apartment specifically or my whole building or the entire complex without the vital liquid.
		Before I could finish getting dressed though, the toilet started making sounds as this one does every once in a while, and the sink in the kitchen gurgled a little.
		For whatever reason, the water was back.
	</p>

<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		Today&apos;s job application was for a pharmacy store.
		They wanted me to take a personality test, and timed my taking of it.
		With my luck though, the Internet connection kept going down in the middle of the test, and at one point, it took about fifteen minutes to get the connection back up, almost doubling the amount of time it took for me to finish.
		Getting back to the test after I got the connection back up was no simple task, either.
