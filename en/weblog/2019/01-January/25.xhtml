<section id="Wi-Fi">
	<h2>Wi-Fi</h2>
	<p>
		I wasted the entire morning trying to learn to hack Wi-Fi networks.
		I&apos;ve been getting terrible reception from the open networks at my complex lately, so I thought I&apos;d try for a closed network.
		Hacking Wi-Fi networks is a basic skill everyone should have, but it&apos;s not one I&apos;ve actually managed to pull off.
		Ever.
		Anyway, it seems the basic tools for that job aren&apos;t built for Debian&apos;s stable repositories.
		I got the main tool running, but it couldn&apos;t find any networks in its scan for whatever reason.
		<code>bully</code> doesn&apos;t seem to exist in the repos at all, and when I tried moving on without data from the scan, I was told my version of <code>reaver</code> was too old.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did learn something useful to my use case though.
		It seems for now, I can get decent reception from the open networks from my entryway.
		This is particularly odd as it used to be that my bedroom had great reception but my entryway had almost none.
		Now things are reversed.
		I should have an easier time getting coursework done now when the term begins, now that I know where to go.
	</p>

<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		Wow.
		I was finally getting around to filling out those job applications this afternoon, and the cash store job&apos;s application has quite a question on it.
		It says they only want people that specifically want to work for their company, and asks for three reasons why working for them is your absolute dream job.
		The word &quot;absolute&quot; is emphasised via boldface, an underline, and a space between every letter.
		They really want to stress that word.
		Honestly, I don&apos;t see why that would be anyone&apos;s dream job.
		It seems decent, but certainly not anything remarkable in any way.
		I have no doubt that whomever gets the job will have lied about it being their dream job, but I just don&apos;t have it in me to make such a claim and make it seem sincere.
		I can&apos;t pull that off, and they won&apos;t hire me if I&apos;m honest, so I guess I won&apos;t be returning that application.
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up throwing out a second application too.
		I&apos;m not sure quite what it was about it, but I got a bad feeling that the job wasn&apos;t right for me.
	</p>

<section id="cleaning">
	<h2>Cleaning</h2>
	<p>
		With the job hunt work done for the day, I should have gotten looking for another <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair removal place.
		Instead, I worked on cleaning my apartment some more.
		To be honest, the home-cleaning should probably wait until I&apos;ve had my vasectomy.
		It&apos;d give me something to do while I&apos;m stuck at home for a week.
		Yes, coursework will be my top priority during that period, but that can&apos;t possibly take all my time when I don&apos;t even have errands or work using any of my time.
	</p>
	<p>
		In particular, I threw out my paperwork box, moving the paperwork to a storage drawer I never found a use for, consolidating things and saving space.
		I also threw out any jar I couldn&apos;t fit my hand into.
		I used to save those jars for making ranch dressing in, but I don&apos;t make it any more because I&apos;m trying to lose flab.
		I started using those jars to rehydrate dry beans, but the beans leave a residue I can&apos;t clean out because I can&apos;t fit my hand in there.
		I should probably get some sort of sponge on a stick or something for that sort of job, but the beans can be just as easily rehydrated in larger jars or even bowels, and I need to clear stuff out of my home.
		I&apos;ll take advantage of any excuse to do that.
		I got rid of various other items I have no need for as well, such as the onion chopper I never use.
	</p>

<section id="religion">
	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		I brought the holy book, the Book of Mormon, given to me by the missionaries to work today, fully intending to read it on my breaks.
		I&apos;d have two break, ten minutes long each, so that&apos;d add up to more than the fifteen minutes per day I agreed to set aside to read it.
		However, things didn&apos;t turn out that way.
		On my first break, I had to run around actually getting things done.
		For example, I didn&apos;t head into work as early as I meant to, so I wasn&apos;t able to write down my schedule for the coming week before work.
		Instead, that had to happen during my first break.
		On the second break, I was hungry and ate my dinner instead of reading.
		On my unexpected third break (Why did they give me a third break?), I was about to actually read the book, but then remembered that without my laptop, I couldn&apos;t write my thoughts on the contents while I read, and would likely miss important things when I went back to write later.
		Reading this book is going to have to be done at home in front of my keyboard.
		It should go without saying that the time I write about this text will be included in my fifteen minutes, too.
		I&apos;m setting aside fifteen minutes each day to read, think about, and write about what these people want me to believe in.
		Of course, I&apos;m free to read and write more too it I have time or something catches my interest.
		Now, without further ado ...
	</p>
	<p>
		<del>In the introduction, we&apos;re informed that the supposed translator of the gold plates, on which this text supposedly came from, decided to abridge the text.
		Seriously?
		This is supposedly part of the word of their god, and afterwards, the gold plates were taken away by an angel, never to be seen again.
		He couldn&apos;t be bothered to take down the entire thing while it was still available to be taken down?
		He just cuts out parts?
		Not cool.
		I mean, my guess is that he didn&apos;t actually have any gold plates or holy word at all and simply wrote the Book of Mormon from scratch, making it not actually an abridged version of anything.
		However, if this actually is holy word and he abridged it the only time it was made available to mankind, that seems a bit sacrilegious.</del>
		<ins>Oops, never mind.
		I misunderstood.
		Someone in the ancient past abridged the then-widely-available word of Yahweh and inscribed it on the gold plates.
		The original version was then supposedly lost to time, but the gold plates with the abridged version remained hidden.
		Then, the modern translator translated the abridged version, being the only version left, and the plates were taken away.
		That&apos;s just a bad turn of events, and not an intentional throwing out of the full version.</ins>
	</p>
	<p>
		The next couple of sections are testimonies from two groups of people that supposedly saw the plates.
		However, the second set, which had eight people.
		Assuming this group wasn&apos;t bribed with seats of power in the church, all Smith had to do was produce plates that looked old.
		They might even <strong>*have*</strong> been old.
		He may have found them, claimed to translate them using divine power, then disposed of them.
		The first group, a group of three, claims to have seen an angel as well, and the angel told them the plates were real.
		This group is much more likely to have been bribed with seats of power in the church.
