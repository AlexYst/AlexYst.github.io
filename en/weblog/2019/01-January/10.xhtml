	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		My final exams have been completed.
		I guess tomorrow, I start the job hunt.
	</p>

<section id="pens">
	<h2>Gel pens</h2>
	<p>
		The gel pen set arrived today.
		I&apos;m not sure what to think of the case.
		It&apos;s a lot thicker than I imagined it&apos;d be, but then again, it has to be to hold all the pens.
		Just like as the image online showed, this thing is sort of like a book.
		Each space between pages can be unzipped to access some of the pens.
		The spot just inside the front cover is mostly wasted space though.
		I knew there would be some wasted space, but I guess the maths of how much wasted space there would be didn&apos;t quite occur to me.
		That said, this was the best case I saw available, in my opinion.
		I&apos;m just very frugal, including in terms of space, so it&apos;s disappointing that one of the pages doesn&apos;t offer the full usability the other pages do.
		I did see one case with seemingly no wasted space, but it was also a smaller case, only able to hold forty-eight pens.
		Still a nice set-up, but if I&apos;m going to spring for a pen set, it should be the bigger one that I&apos;ll enjoy more, especially when the bigger set only cost me two more dollars than the smaller set would have.
		I think I&apos;d buy this set again, except I don&apos;t need two of it.
		One&apos;ll suffice.
		I was right to get the pink case.
		Even though it&apos;s pink, it otherwise looks very much like leather to me.
		If I&apos;d gotten the brown one, I&apos;d probably question whether they&apos;d sent me a product made from dead critter skin, and I wouldn&apos;t like the thought of that.
	</p>
	<p>
		The case is definitely large though.
		I&apos;m not going to want to bring the full set to work with me to draw on my breaks.
		I need most of the space in my bag for all the empty soda bottles my workmates throw out.
		I take them home to later turn in for the deposit.
		It amazes me that they find the money to buy our over-priced, name-brand soda every day, but it amazes me more that they just throw away the bottles when they&apos;re done.
		I mean, I get that they&apos;re too lazy to turn them in for the deposit, but we&apos;re all working minimum wage here.
		They&apos;re not exactly rich.
		But also, we have a recycling dumpster, and they&apos;re too lazy to walk out to it, so they throw the plastic bottles in the trash.
		I&apos;ll probably pick up a small pencil case at the second-hand store next to my workplace tomorrow if I can find one.
	</p>
	<p>
		After examining the large case a bit though, I found one of the metal staples on one of the zippers was dislodged.
		I&apos;d say it wasn&apos;t installed well and I bumped it loose, but there&apos;s another in which the staple&apos;s off-centre, and the prong was put right through the teeth of the zipper!
		I may need to find some matching thread and stitch the zipper ends together instead of relying on the staples the manufacturer put in place.
