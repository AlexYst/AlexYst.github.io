<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		The coming term is just about here.
		My registration requests for next term have been approved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Actually, why do these requests ever need to wait for approval?
		The simple fact is that we aren&apos;t able to register for courses that&apos;ve filled up already.
		I learned that last term, when my advisor messed around and wouldn&apos;t help me fix the registration issues until the last minute, so I wasn&apos;t able to get into the one course I most wanted.
		Unless course prerequisites aren&apos;t properly used to prevent registration right away when students try to register, there shouldn&apos;t be a reason to postpone registration request approval.

<section id="religion">
	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		Continuing with my reading of the Book of Mormon, it seems there were several classes of plates that Smith dug up.
		The first set was mainly devoted to religion, and this set actually never got abridged.
		However, two other sets devoted instead mainly to history of now-ancient peoples did get abridged.
		In other words, no holy text was probably lost.
		Or, y&apos;know, holy text that supposedly existed before Smith translated (or more likely, wrote himself) it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first chapter of the book talks about how the (supposed) author&apos;s father prayed and saw a vision.
		Not much of note in that.
		However, the vision showed him Yahweh on his throne, with angels around singing Yahweh&apos;s praise.
		Again, this paints Yahweh as a conceited god.
	</p>

<section id="cleaning">
	<h2>Cleaning</h2>
	<p>
		It&apos;s been been five or six months now that I&apos;ve wanted to just take a nice, relaxing, scented bath.
		So I figured I&apos;d finally get to do that today.
		Instead, I ended up going on another cleaning binge.
		I got quite a bit done though, and my home does look nicer.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="done">
	<h2>I&apos;m done with this.</h2>
	<p>
		Today, I had a customer ask me what sodas we carry.
		So, I rattled them off as I always do.
		I&apos;ve had to tell people what sodas we stock so many times that I have the list memorised, and on those oddball times when we have an extra soda flavour, I forget to include it because the list is so engrained in my head.
		They asked for the cola, and met me at the window.
		There, they saw I had a bottle of Pepsi-Cola, so they asked if it was Pepsi or Coke.
		They had wanted Coke-a-cola, and had assumed &quot;cola&quot; meant Coke-a-cola and not Pepsi-Cola.
		They then got really snippy with me and told me I shouldn&apos;t say &quot;cola&quot; if it isn&apos;t Coke, as it&apos;ll confuse people.
		I didn&apos;t tell them this, but, um, hello?
		If I meant Coke, I would have said &quot;Coke&quot;.
		I didn&apos;t say &quot;Coke&quot;.
		If you assume a certain brand when I didn&apos;t specify a brand, that&apos;s <strong>*entirely*</strong> your fault, not at all mine.
		What word do you want me to use if I&apos;m listing off soda flavours, <strong>*not*</strong> listing soda brands?
	</p>
	<p>
		It would have ended there.
		It wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve even been worth mentioning it in my journal.
		However, they decided to call the store and complain about me to the head manager.
		The head manager literally swore at me for calling the soda &quot;cola&quot; and told me to just &quot;call it what it&apos;s called&quot;.
		That&apos;s what I was <strong>*doing*</strong>: just calling the soda what it&apos;s called!
		But anyway, they&apos;ve now got me calling it by brand, which is outright humiliating.
		Way too many people are so hung up on brands that they can&apos;t even figure out the generic words to describe something.
		They even call items made by some companies by the names of other companies.
		On the other hand, I lack brand loyalty, and therefore tend to the actual names of items instead of the names of brands, especially unrelated brands.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, the head manager called me off my break just to tell me they knew full well that the customer was in the wrong.
		They continued though that they don&apos;t care about that.
		They only care about customers calling them up while they&apos;re trying to work on other tasks.
		I understand wanting to get your work done, but at the same time, the head manager has proven their cowardice when it comes to customers many, many times.
		I fully believe they don&apos;t like getting pulled away from their tasks - I feel the same way - but I also think there&apos;s another component here.
		They head manager is too cowardly to tell the customer that they&apos;re in the wrong and can just stick it.
		You don&apos;t swear at your employee that did nothing wrong just because an idiotic customer can&apos;t figure out their own native language.
		That&apos;s just not okay.
		I&apos;m done with this.
		This is the final straw.
		I&apos;m done trying, and I&apos;m definitely done trying to cram extra products on the customers.
		If the head manager wants up-sells, they shouldn&apos;t be continually tearing down the morale of the employees making that happen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every once in a while, the head manager asks if I&apos;m tired of working the drive-through.
		I&apos;ve been tired of it for probably over a year now.
		Every time a customer throws a tantrum, the head manager always sides with the customer.
		It&apos;s terrible for morale, and I&apos;ve been sick of it.
		I keep claiming not to be tired of it.
		I keep just trudging along, because I know I&apos;m good at it, because I know other employees hate working drive (for good reason), and because only the employees on registers earn any tips.
		I could use the money, y&apos;know?
		But I&apos;m done.
		Next time they ask, I&apos;ll tell him I&apos;m quite tired of it.
		Honestly, I think they&apos;re only making a poor attempt at conversation when they ask.
		They&apos;ve proven in the past that when you directly ask to be taken off a particular post, they won&apos;t do it.
		That even applies to posts they&apos;ve directly told you to tell them if you ever get tired of.
		That said, they might take me off anyway.
		They might actually be kind this time.
		I know that&apos;s asking too much from them, but some part of me thinks maybe they&apos;d be reasonable.
		At the very least though, it should get them to stop asking me if I&apos;m tired of it yet.

<section id="vasectomy">
	<h2>Vasectomy</h2>
	<p>
		For who-knows-what reason, I was planning to put off even getting my vasectomy scheduled until I&apos;ve gotten my basic medical check-up next month.
		I could use that week off from work now though.
		The sooner the better.
		Getting my bloodline ended will just be a bonus.
		The surgeon told me I needed to wait at least a month but no longer than six months after our talk to get the vasectomy.
		(If I waited longer, I&apos;d need to have another talk with them and wait another month.)
		According to my records (in other words, my journal), we had that talk and I signed the consent form on <a href="/en/weblog/2018/12-December/13.xhtml">2018-12-13</a>.
		The month has passed and I&apos;m in the clear.
		I should go try to schedule that tomorrow or the next day.
	</p>
	<p>
		Huh.
		I think they said I&apos;m not supposed to orgasm that week.
		That&apos;ll be lovely.
		Still, a week away from the head manager would be worth it, and I&apos;ll have plenty of time to myself to relax after completing my coursework.
		It shouldn&apos;t be too bad.
