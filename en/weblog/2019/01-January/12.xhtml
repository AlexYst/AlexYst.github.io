	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		Today I was scheduled to come into work a bit early, and I was to get off even earlier.
		I ended up procrastinating this morning, counting on having time after work to finish up my résumé.
		Not so much though.
		A workmate wanted to take the bus home, and they were scheduled to close.
		Apparently, the buses don&apos;t run that late.
		I wouldn&apos;t know, as I use a bike instead.
		It&apos;s nice not being bound to the buses&apos; schedule.
		So anyway, they asked me to take their closing shift, so I ended up coming in early and <strong>*still*</strong> closing the shop.
		I should&apos;ve gotten to work on my résumé this morning.
		I can never be sure I&apos;ll have the time I count on having later.

<section id="drawing">
	<h2>Drawing</h2>
	<p>
		Once again, I spent my breaks today drawing.
		My new pen set came with six ugly swirl pens.
		If a pen has swirled ink with only similar colours, it could be pretty cool.
		For example, a pen could have only shades of blue or only shades of green.
		Even a pen with several specific colours could be beautiful in its own way.
		For example, if it was a red/orange/yellow swirl pen, you could use it to draw fire, or even autumn leaves.
		But no.
		I&apos;ve never seen such pens.
		Instead, every swirled gel pen I&apos;ve ever seen has tried to cram an entire rainbow into its tube.
		I can&apos;t fathom why anyone actually likes these things, but I did do a Web search, and found an article from someone about how swirl gel pens are their favourite.
		They talk about which swirled gel pens are the best in their opinion, and as seen in the included photographs, they&apos;re not talking about the somewhat cool hypothetical pens I described.
		No, they really like the ugly, rainbow swirl pens.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll find a use for every pen in the set at some point, save for these swirl pens, but the swirl pens would sit in the case and rot if I didn&apos;t deliberately find a use for them.
		So that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been doing.
		In every one of my drawings, I&apos;ve found a way to work a swirl pen in somehow.
		In yesterday&apos;s flowers, I took a pen that was currently outputting orange and purple and used it for some of the inner lines of the petals.
		Neither orange nor purple look out of place on a flower, though I admit their mix didn&apos;t look that great on it.
		The pen ended up going mostly purple near the end, so I used it again today for grapes.
		I took another swirl pen that was mostly outputting purple as well, and used that for other grapes, so I got a bit of a highlight on some of the grapes.
		For a third swirl pen, I chose one that was mostly outputting green, and used it on the leaves.
		But then it quickly started flipping to orange and back to green.
		It poisoned the drawing, and made the vine&apos;s leaves look like they were dying.
		You can&apos;t get consistency out of these swirl pens, so I&apos;m not sure how you&apos;re supposed to make anything look good using them.
		Like I said, some variance would be fine, but flips to drastically different colours really kills your chances of getting something that looks very nice.
		Unless I make a mistake, I&apos;m definitely never buying swirl-type refills.
		Any other type of refill I&apos;ve ever seen would be almost infinitely better.
