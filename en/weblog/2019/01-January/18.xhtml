<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		I found an interesting job in the next city over: basically a <abbr title="Oregon Department of Human Services">ODHS</abbr> secretary.
		I feel I could learn a lot about the agency by working there, and though it&apos;d mean a long commute by bike every day, it also pays about double what I make now, so I&apos;d make it work.
		However, they require an &quot;acceptable method of transportation&quot;, and by that, I assume they mean a car.
		I don&apos;t drive, I bike, so that&apos;s not going to work out.
		I found a second job in the same agency, but that job requires two years of having dealt with high levels of paperwork and taking down personal information.
		I could get that experience there, but they want me to have it before I&apos;m hired.
		I currently don&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found another grocery store to apply at, but had to pass due to inability to fill out the application.
		The application requires you to identify as a Mr., Mrs., or Ms, none of which I am.
	</p>
	<p>
		I couldn&apos;t find any other jobs to apply for.
		There&apos;s just not enough jobs that don&apos;t either demand experience I don&apos;t have or leave me practically where I am now.
		I looked through hundreds of listings, but found nothing viable.
		I need to move forward, not just escape my current hellhole to a hellhole in another location.
		I guess tomorrow, I&apos;ll go print a bunch of physical copies of my résumé, then on Monday, I&apos;ll go around and try to get local businesses to take interest.
		Maybe I&apos;ll get a bite or two.
		This is where recouperation from last term probably ends, and the major job hunt begins.
	</p>

<section id="battery">
	<h2>Another lost battery</h2>
	<p>
		On the way to work, I noticed I&apos;ve lost another camera battery.
		How am I dropping these without noticing!?
		I think I&apos;m going to need to modify the case I keep the camera in so the batteries can&apos;t slip out as easily.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="splash">
	<h2>Splash guards</h2>
	<p>
		When I bike in the rain, the tires constantly fling mud at me, which isn&apos;t very pleasant.
		I can stand the water, but when I get to my destination and find a muddy strip on the back of my pants, it&apos;s something I&apos;d like to avoid.
		I&apos;ve seen bicycles with splash guards around the tires, but I&apos;d always assumed those were a part of the bike itself.
		I got a closer look at some though, and they&apos;re an attachment!
		I wonder where I can get a used pair that&apos;s the right size for my bike ...
	</p>
</section>
<section id="without">
	<h2>Doing without</h2>
	<p>
		I keep wondering about getting an Internet connection set up despite the <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr>&apos;s shadiness.
		I also keep contemplating getting a mobile and mobile Internet service.
		I realised today that I should go without them a while longer though.
		I need to be saving up for electrolysis and voice lessons.
		Whatever expenses I can spare, I should.
		Of course, some expenses are worth it, such as this pen set.
		I&apos;m much more relaxed when I can doodle in colour, and that&apos;s got to be good for my mental and emotional health.
		The mobile line won&apos;t really get me much though.
		The Internet connection would save me some stress when I&apos;m having trouble connecting to the neighbours&apos; Wi-Fi because it&apos;s not stretching as far as usual, but it&apos;s a reoccurring cost, and that cost is rather high.
		I&apos;ll get more out of not having that bill to pay, at least for now.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="pens">
	<h2>Pen case</h2>
	<p>
		I found a better case for bringing pens to work today.
		It&apos;s an old hand-held game console case, but what makes is so great is that it&apos;s compact, much more so than that clunky water bottle I&apos;ve been storing pens in.
		At a little over two dollars, it was definitely worth it.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="doodles">
	<h2>Doodles</h2>
	<p>
		One of the shift leaders noticed that I was drawing something small each time a customer was ordering.
		My intent, of course, was for each line I added to form a part of the larger image I was working on.
		I can draw while I listen to the customer, but the time it takes to order is so short that I don&apos;t get much doodling done in a single order.
		The shift leader thought I was using the doodle to keep a sort of encrypted tally of something though, based on the pattern of when I&apos;d draw.
		Hilarious.
		As I admitted to them though, I have tried to keep encrypted tallies in the past, so maybe those aren&apos;t as covert as I&apos;d hoped.
		Sometimes I like to keep track of things though without anyone questioning what I&apos;m keeping track of.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, they drew a small heart on my sketchpad.
		I guess I have been leaving some of my pens unattended with the intent that someone might draw something with them, but that was a habit from when I was drawing on the order pads.
		I;m not sure why I&apos;ve still been doing it, and having a heart show up on my pad was rather unexpected.
		It was kind of fun to see though, and it&apos;s not like I&apos;m working on some masterpiece.
		I&apos;m just relieving stress and trying to improve my skills.
