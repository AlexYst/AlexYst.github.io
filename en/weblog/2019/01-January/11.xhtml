<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		The first think I need to do is get my résumé built.
		I was hoping to complete that today, but I ended up not finishing.
		I guess the résumé is my main task for this break between terms though.
		Résumés have never been a strong suit of mine.
		If I can get it done before school starts, I might be able to use it to try to seek jobs while school is in session, if I end up with another slowish term like I did this last time.
		I see no reason why I won&apos;t finish the résumé in a couple days though, so I should be able to start applying for jobs long before the coming term.
	</p>
	<p>
		A while ago, I decided I&apos;d use my school-assigned email address for this job hunt.
		Mostly, I guess I want to not directly lead potential employers to my domain, which alludes to the presence of my website.
		I don&apos;t have anything bad here, but I just don&apos;t want to be judged but it before they even meet me.
		Though my rationalization for using the school-assigned email address is that the <code>edu</code> <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> might make me look more professional.
		So I checked with my email client to make sure what my school-assigned email address is, as I never use it, and found my client&apos;s been locked out of my account since November.
		Supposedly, the password was incorrect.
		I figured it was just one of those things where the system forces you to change your password periodically, so I logged in via the Web, and sure enough, that was the problem.
		Supposedly, this is for security, but the system has a password length limit of sixteen characters, so you&apos;ve got to assume with such short passwords that the system isn&apos;t actually very secure at all.
		It figures, seeing as my school uses Microsoft&apos;s servers for their email system.
		I updated the password with a new random one generated once again via KeePassX, and a page came up asking me to verify contact information in case I lost access to my account, so I verified my email address via a code they sent me and moved on.
		For some reason, it logged me back out as soon as I&apos;d entered the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I logged in again, this time with the new password, and the same page came up again, this time showing that the email address had been verified.
		However, Microsoft was claiming to need further information.
		The only things they allowed me to enter were one email address (which was already in place) and one telephone number, so I figured they were trying to force a telephone number out of me.
		I&apos;m going to need to get a telephone line set up for my job hunt, but there&apos;s no valid reason why Microsoft needs access to that number.
		I figured I was going to need to complain to the university about being locked out of my school email account.
		Who knows how long that would take to resolve ...
		It seems like a quick thing to fix, but they&apos;re not always the best about responding in a timely fashion or keeping me in the loop.
		I tried moving on again though, and this time everything worked fine.
		I guess Microsoft was just trying to squeeze that number out of me, but weren&apos;t going to push if I&apos;d declined to give it twice in a row.
		Microsoft my be terrible, but they seem to be less pushy about telephone numbers than Google.
		Then again, I wasn&apos;t signing up for a new account, I was trying to access my existing account through an organisation.
		Perhaps for personal accounts, they would be as pushy as Google.
		I don&apos;t know and I don&apos;t intend to find out.

<section id="drawing">
	<h2>Drawing</h2>
	<p>
		Today on my breaks, I tried adding intentional variance to the flower I keep drawing.
		This compliments the accidental variance, and I really like how the flower comes out now.
		I&apos;ve got to say, I&apos;m pretty good at drawing this one flower now, even if it&apos;s the only think I can draw particularly well.
		I think after I&apos;ve practised with this flower a bit more, I&apos;ll go back and revisit my grapevine design.
		The grapevine design is a bit less realistic, but I think it shows promise.
		If I can keep finding things I can draw okay-ish and improve on them one by one, I might get a better general art sense as well.
