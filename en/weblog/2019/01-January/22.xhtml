<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		I was always told that when searching for a job, you should head out early, around 07:00 or 08:00.
		My shifts are at night and I need rest, so I headed out at a little before 08:00.
		It turns out I forgot something and had to head back, so I ended up beginning at about 08:27.
		So many places were closed though.
		They don&apos;t even open that early.
		Why have people told me to head out so early?
		And every time I job hunt, I forget that the local businesses aren&apos;t open yet and try heading out when I was told was best to head out so long ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		I figured I&apos;d make my way to the credit union to pick up my rent cheque, putting in résumé in the few places I could along the way, then start another loop after 10:00, when most businesses opened.
		I did notice one place that had a help wanted sign though: they adult shop.
		I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve even tried to apply there normally, but hey, why not?
		They&apos;re known to be hiring, increasing my chances of getting a job there, and I think many people wouldn&apos;t apply amount of embarrassment, potentially cutting the applicant pool.
		I&apos;ll take an adult shop job if it gets me out of my current job.
		They want applications though, not résumés, so they gave me one to fill out that I dropped off on my second round.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried the bike shop, but they say they don&apos;t need more people in the Winter, and to try back in the spring.
		That sounds like seasonal employment though, which isn&apos;t what I&apos;m after.
		The next place that was open was a second-hand store.
		Again, they take applications, so I took one to bring back on my second round.
	</p>
	<p>
		My first round got cut short though.
		I tried to bike up a ramp onto the sidewalk, but it was raised a bit more than usual from the gutter, so with the angle I was travelling, I instead crashed on it.
		I ruined my glove and my pants, and messed up my skin a bit.
		I needed some time to recover, but more than that, I needed to change into presentable pants to continue my job hunt.
		I hadn&apos;t even made it to the credit union, either.
		I got cleaned up as best I could, but I couldn&apos;t get all the dirt out of my hand, so it&apos;ll probably get mildly infected.
		I needed a third reference besides my supervisor for the second-hand store job, so I was only able to finish the adult shop application.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, I headed back out the completed job application and my stack of résumés.
		I didn&apos;t reach as many businesses as I&apos;d like to have, but then again, I had to get back home in time for work, too.
		I got a few résumés out, and picked up even more applications, so I&apos;ll probably get those filled out and brought back tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hadn&apos;t been overly hopeful when I started out, but I found a second place actively looking for a new employee: this time, a cash place.
		Again, I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve tried that place if not for the help wanted sign, but I think I have enough of a shot at the job to make it worth trying.

	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		I couldn&apos;t resist dropping by the medical centre today to find their prices see about scheduling <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair removal.
		They don&apos;t offer it for the time being though because they don&apos;t currently have a <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> technician!
		Ugh.
		I don&apos;t know where else in town offers it, and I&apos;d rather not head to the next city over for a multiple-procedure process if I don&apos;t have to.
		I guess I&apos;ll need to do more research and see what I can find.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="medical">
	<h2>Medical check-up</h2>
	<p>
		My doctors&apos; office sent me notice that it&apos;s been long enough that they want me to come in for a routine check-up.
		I feel fine, but since I&apos;m going in anyway, I&apos;m making a list of all the minor issues I can come up with so I can ask about them.
		I might as well, right?
		I suppose I&apos;ll stop by the clinic tomorrow to get the appointment scheduled.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="freezer">
	<h2>Freezer door jam</h2>
	<p>
		The freezer at work has an alarm that beeps at you if both the door is open and the temperature is too high.
		The more-incompetent of my workmates tend to leave the freezer open a crack because they can&apos;t be bothered to close it all the way, then after the temperature drops, one of the rest of us notice because the temperature has dropped and the beeping has begun.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got to work today and noticed the freezer open again, so I closed it.
		We really don&apos;t have the space we need because the business keeps growing while the building does not, so our back room with the freezer&apos;s a bit cluttered at the moment.
		A table ended up moved in front of the freezer.
		Later, I heard it beeping again.
		With the table in the way, I figured no one had gotten into the freezer again, so I took a closer look.
		Someone had packed meat boxes in it rather poorly, and they were holding the door ajar!
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, I was stationed on drive-through.
		If I wasn&apos;t, I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve been in the back room and wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve noticed the freezer crying out for help.
		The boxes in the way, blocking the door, were of course at the very bottom, because why wouldn&apos;t they be?
		To be honest, it&apos;s because not only does the the door have a shelf down there, but the back of the freezer is also thicker down there, resulting in less space for the boxes before they stick into the door&apos;s space.
		So I&apos;m trying to get all the boxes out of the freezer so I can reposition the ones at the bottom, but customers won&apos;t leave me alone long enough for me to do that.
		I don&apos;t normally mind helping customers, but it&apos;s a problem if our freezer isn&apos;t keeping the meat at a safe temperature.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, I get all the boxes out, and start trying to position the bottom ones in the way that&apos;ll use the most of the available space, but allow the freezer to close.
		All while having to run to the drive-through any time another chain of customers appeared.
		I never had more than a few minutes at a time to work on getting the meat back into the freezer.
		Soon, I try without any boxes near the door at all, and find the door still won&apos;t close.
		The boxes propped the door open before, but with the door open, ice sublimated out of the air due to the cold, and now that was blocking the door as well.
		So out go all the boxes, and I try scrape out all the ice.
		The door <strong>*still*</strong> won&apos;t close.
		By this point, I&apos;m <strong>*beyond*</strong> irritated.
		The meat&apos;s going to thaw, the freezer won&apos;t close without any explicable reason, and the customers won&apos;t leave me alone long enough to find a solution and set things right.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, I found the problem.
		Someone had put a metal slug on top of the inside of the door.
		This small chunk of metal was propping the door open and letting all the cold air out.
		I put the boxes back pretty much exactly where they were when I found them.
		It turns out that as much as it <strong>*looked*</strong> like they were in the door&apos;s way, they weren&apos;t.
		Was the ice ever in the way?
		Who knows.
		I don&apos;t know how that slug could have gotten there though except for intentionally.
		Did someone try to sabotage our meat?

<section id="sketchpad">
	<h2>Sketchpad</h2>
	<p>
		As I said the other day, I didn&apos;t mind when someone doodled on my sketchpad, but today, someone decided to tear off a page and use it to put a note on someone&apos;s chest.
		Really?
		You&apos;re wasting my quality sketch paper for that when there&apos;s scratch paper all over the building!?
		Seriously, they could have used the back of any of the hundreds of used order tickets for that.
		They didn&apos;t need to waste my good paper, and it felt very disrespectful that they&apos;d done that.
		So I wrote on the next page:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			I don&apos;t mind if you draw on me, but please don&apos;t rip out my pages - it hurts!
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I&apos;ll probably write that on the rest of the blank pages as well.
		I would say it&apos;s to make sure it doesn&apos;t happen again, but let&apos;s be honest: mostly it&apos;s just something I can use one of the ugly swirl pens for.
		I really don&apos;t like those things, and the sooner I can replace their ink with non-swirl ink, the better.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of the swirl pens, I&apos;ve been using using them quite a bit for drawing flowers, as flowers can pretty much be whatever colour I say they are.
		I don&apos;t have to worry too much about the pens changing colours on me; I just end up with ugly flowers sometimes.
		I have been using regular green pens for the leaves though, so I&apos;ve been using green more than any other non-swirl colour.
		Because of that, I switched to a different of my then-purple swirl pens, as it had a lovely green section I thought would be useful to get to.
		However, the pen&apos;s almost dry, and it&apos;s still only output purple ink.
		There&apos;s been a little variance, but not a whole lot.
		The green seems to just be mixing into the purple and making a lilac shade of purple.
		Ironically, the one time I tried to make use of the colour switch, I didn&apos;t get the switch at all.
		This has actually been a well-behaved purple pen, and had I known it&apos;d actually stay mostly one colour, this pen wouldn&apos;t be on the list of swirl pens I&apos;m using on things just to be done with them.
