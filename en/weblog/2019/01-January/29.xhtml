<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		I wasn&apos;t sure what to do today.
		I&apos;d planned to use today to gather applications and drop off résumés at the local mall.
		I&apos;d then drop off completed applications tomorrow.
		But then I noticed on my calendar that school starts tomorrow.
		I feel stuck.
		There&apos;s no time to find a job before the term starts, and it might be better to wait until I&apos;ve recovered from the vasectomy anyway to keep looking.
		I&apos;ve got my résumé now.
		That was the main thing keeping me from job-hunting during last term.
		This school trains me so much that I wasn&apos;t up for crafting even a simple resume while still dealing with coursework and my day job.
		I can job hunt this term though.
		Maybe I could use today and tomorrow to rest before the term starts.
		I feel like I haven&apos;t been able to sit down and actually relax for at least five or six months now.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end, I ended up deciding to go out to the mall as originally planned, just so I wouldn&apos;t have to admit to my journal and anyone reading it that I gave up.
		Already, if you&apos;ve been paying attention, I&apos;ve been making plans and not keeping all of them, though in my defence, I&apos;ve also been getting other things done in their place, such as when I stockpiled food for my off week instead of working on my job hunt.
		Though after thinking about it a bit, I realised I&apos;ll have my time to rest soon enough.
		The vasectomy&apos;s going to knock me out of commission for a week.
		I&apos;ll still have coursework to work on, but I won&apos;t be able to go to work or run errands, so mostly all I&apos;ll have to do al day is relax.
		I won&apos;t be able to take the scented bath I wanted to, because I won&apos;t be able to bathe at all due to the hole in my scrotum, but I&apos;ll lie in bed and just think about things, or I&apos;ll sit on the chair in the entryway and draw flowers or something.
		I&apos;ll have my much-needed down time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I dropped off three résumés, though one was at a place known not to be hiring at the moment.
		I picked up several applications, and jotted down even more web addresses for online applications.
		One application I found amusing asks for a middle name, and provides a check box to specify that you don&apos;t have one.
		They want to distinguish between candidates that simply neglect to include their middle name and ones that legitimately don&apos;t have one.
		Why do they care that much?
		I&apos;m guessing you don&apos;t need the middle name for a background check, especially if you have the Social Security number, which would be submitted upon consideration for hire.

<section id="bicycle">
	<h2>Another bicycle</h2>
	<p>
		The on-site manager&apos;s mother gave me the other bicycle!
		This one&apos;s not as fancy as the last, but its gear shifters seem to work correctly.
		I still need to fix up the blue one though, when I get a chance.
		I mean, there&apos;s no point in letting a perfectly good bicycle go to waste, and that gear shifter is the only real problem with it.
		I also need to fix the chain on my purple bicycle.
		I&apos;m not entirely sure what&apos;s wrong with it, but it tends to skip a lot lately.
		A friend told me it might just need some lube though.
	</p>
	<p>
		The left peddle on this bike wasn&apos;t attached when she gave it to me, so I worked out how to get it back on.
		It fell off again twice though.
		That might be why the peddle was off to begin with.
		Once I broke out my socket wrench and tightened the bolt as far as I dared to, I was able to make my next trip without issues.
	</p>

<section id="religion">
	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		Once more, I picked up the Book of Mormon to continue learning what the Mormons believe in.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I ended on the note that the unfaithful siblings spoke with an angel, yet doubted the capabilities of their god.
		The next chapter begins with the faithful sibling pointing out just that.
		At the point you have proof of Yahweh&apos;s existence, such as a live angel speaking to you, why have any more doubt?
		I mean, doubt Yahweh&apos;s motives fore sure, but why think he can&apos;t take down a single person, or even a single army?
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems I was mistaken about what the siblings were retrieving though.
		I thought it was a record of their family tree engraved on brass.
		Instead, it seems it was actually the first five books of the bible engraved in brass.
		Given how conceited Yahweh has been portrayed so far, I can see why retrieving this was important.
		(If he wasn&apos;t so conceited, he could have just reproduced it, but he&apos;d prefer to make the original seem more important by sending someone after it.)
		A family tree, on the other hand, is next to useless, considering people at this time likely don&apos;t know enough about medical science yet to know the importance of genealogy in that context.
		Their only usage of genealogy is petty, at this point.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oops.
		I spoke too soon.
		The brass tablets contain both the bible books <strong>*and*</strong> the genealogical record.
	</p>
	<p>
		The claim is also made though that these plates will never be destroyed and will never be &quot;dimmed&quot;.
		I assume my &quot;dimmed&quot;, the book means corroded or sullied.
		In any case, if the plates will never be destroyed, where are they now?
		If they&apos;ll never be sullied, they can&apos;t be buried somewhere, unless they&apos;re buried in some sort of protective container.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="bath">
	<h2>Scented bath</h2>
	<p>
		I finally took that scented bath I&apos;ve been wanting for about half a year now.
		It&apos;s horrible how busy I allow myself to get.
		There&apos;s just no time to slow down and relax.
		Tonight was really the last chance I was going to get for another long while, though.
		Tomorrow, I&apos;ve got to complete and return those job applications after the missionaries have dropped by.
		Then I&apos;ll be running to the store for lime juice, as the discount store I get it from has it right now, and they usually don&apos;t.
		Running two separate errand trips in one day always wears me out, seeing as unlike most people, I get everywhere via leg power.
		I guess that&apos;s another reason I took the time to take the bath today.
		After running two errand trips, I was tired and needed to relax.
		But tomorrow, there won&apos;t be time to relax after errands.
		The term starts that night.
