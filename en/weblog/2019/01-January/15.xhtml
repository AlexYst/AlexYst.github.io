<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was in a pool with my family, but then I noticed I wasn&apos;t wearing any top.
		I got out, embarrassed, and when to look for a shirt.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can&apos;t recall how I got there, but later, I was at work, putting toppings on pizzas.
		I was fully clothed, but a workmate looked down at my crotch and said &quot;definitely male&quot;.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		After running my Tuesday errands, I decided to check out a different grocery store&apos;s job availability.
		It turns out their website&apos;s too broken to function though.
		I thought it was a ban on <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> at first, but the browser&apos;s debugging console isn&apos;t showing any signs of that.
		I think it&apos;s probably just using badly-written JavaScript that doesn&apos;t actually follow standards or do it&apos;s job.
		It&apos;s too bad, too; I hear if you work at this store long enough, they give you stock in the company.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m going to try applying for at lead one job per day until I get hired, no matter how busy I get.
		I&apos;ll already have more than fifteen job applications out by the time school starts, and that&apos;s a conservative estimate.
		On my days off from work, I hope to apply for several jobs.
		So after trying the specific grocery store and failing, I did another search and thought I found an opening at that store I just tried, but on another site.
		Out of curiosity, I tried it, thinking I&apos;d probably be sent back to the buggy website.
		Instead, I ended up at the site of a farming goods store with a similar name.
		Oops.
		I have mild dyslexia, so if I don&apos;t pay attention, I get things like that mixed up.
		Like yesterday, when I saw some markers that I thought said &quot;4 free grapefruit&quot; on the package.
		I thought it was probably grapefruit-coloured markers or something, but that didn&apos;t match what I was seeing, and &quot;grapefruit&quot; is such an oddly-specific colour, given how general the other colours in the package were.
		After examining the package looking for details, I realised it said &quot;gratuit&quot;, not &quot;grapefruit&quot;, which is probably Spanish for gratis or something.
		Anyway, being on the wrong site, but one that was actually working, I applied for the job.
		They need a checker, and I&apos;m usually working a register at my current job.
		I can easily do what they need of me.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="stuff">
	<h2>New stuff</h2>
	<p>
		When I arrived home, I found three binders outside my door.
		I&apos;m not sure who left them for me or why, but I&apos;d been considering getting a binder for a few days to a week.
		Tonight was laundry night, so I headed into the laundry room, and and found some good stuff on the take-or-leave table too.
		The main thing was part of one of those notebooks with the black pages, made for use with gel pens.
		The cover&apos;s quite a bit damaged and I&apos;d guess about a third of the pages are missing, but it&apos;ll still be fun to write in.
		I also found a blanket and a dish-drying rack, both of which I can make use of.
		The drying rack is one of the ones with the tray that drains off to the side though, so I&apos;ll have to rearrange my counter top to make room for it to drain into the sink.
		Until now, I&apos;ve been leaving wet dishes on a towel in the corner to dry.
