	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		I dropped off the completed job applications today.
		I passed by a hardware store, so I decided to try to apply there as well.
		The heavy lifting of the lumber they have there could even perhaps help with my flab.
		However, it seems they too have moved to online applications.
		I&apos;ll apply there later if I remember.

<section id="bicycle">
	<h2>Bicycle issues</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve figured out why the peddles on this new bike don&apos;t feel right and why the bike feels so slow.
		The gear on the peddles hasn&apos;t been on the top gear!
		The gear shift mechanism isn&apos;t shifting quite to the top gear, so I&apos;m stuck in the middle gear.
		When I physically move the chain with my hand to the top gear, I find the chain rubs badly, making a clanking noise and making it harder to peddle.
		When I get time, I&apos;ll try to see if I can fix this, but I&apos;m guessing I can&apos;t.

	<h2>Drawing</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve found the secret to getting semi-decent results with swirl pens.
		Up to now, I&apos;ve been drawing coloured outlines, and leaving the centres of objects white.
		When using swirl pens, this results in the object drastically changing colours back and forth along its length.
		When used to fill shapes though, the swirl pens&apos; flip-flopping pretty much averages out and puts both colours everywhere.
		It&apos;s still somewhat ugly, but much less ugly.
		However, this method doesn&apos;t account for times when a pen switches to a new set of colours to flip between.
		You still get odd results when that happens unexpectedly.

	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		I was thinking about the Adam and Eve story again today.
		The Mormons say that to disobey a commandment from Yahweh is a sin.
		Yahweh gave Adam and Eve two commandments: reproduce and don&apos;t eat the forbidden fruit.
		He made sure they had no idea how to reproduce without eating the fruit, which would give them that knowledge, among knowledge of other things.
		In other words, if they didn&apos;t sin by eating the fruit, they&apos;d sin by not eating the fruit.
		There was absolutely no way for them to win.
		And of course, when they sinned, their immortality was stripped and they were booted from the Garden of Eden to live difficult lives.
		What a cruel god the Mormon version of Yahweh is.
		I mean, pretty much every version of Yahweh is cruel, but the Mormons try to make their version out as softer and kinder.
		It&apos;d be one thing to simply put them into a difficult life, but to give them impossible-to-follow orders and then punish them for disobedience is crossing a line.
	</p>
	<p>
		Back to reading the introduction to the Book of Mormon, I once more read the account from Joseph Smith about the recovery and translation of the gold plates.
		I covered my thoughts on that account in my journal the first time I read it, so I won&apos;t go over that again, but I did notice something more this time now that I was thinking about Mormon Yahweh&apos;s &quot;loving&quot; personality.
		The messenger angel Moroni tells Smith that he&apos;ll be destroyed if he shows the gold plates to anyone Yahweh doesn&apos;t tell him to.
		He&apos;s resorting to threats of violence instead of just reasoning with the poor guy.
		(That said, I&apos;m pretty sure the &quot;poor guy&quot; wasn&apos;t actually threatened, as I&apos;m pretty sure he made all this up.
		Still, it doesn&apos;t paint Yahweh as kind or loving.)
		The angel also tells Smith that his sole intent in getting the plates must be to glorify Yahweh.
		I mean, that doesn&apos;t meant that the sole intent of everything needs to be to glorify Yahweh by any means, but it really makes it seem like Yahweh&apos;s on an ego trip.
		If this version of Yahweh is real, we were probably created just to bolster Yahweh&apos;s ego.s

<section id="prank">
	<h2>Pranking workmates</h2>
	<p>
		Quite a while ago, we had a new employee join our ranks.
		When they introduced themself, I introduced myself as &quot;Sam&quot;, to mess with them.
		We then pretty much didn&apos;t see each other for several weeks, as they were on day shift and I was on night, and I don&apos;t think they ever had a reason to talk about me.
		I know I didn&apos;t have a reason to talk about them.
		And they probably forgot my fake name.
		Again, I know I forgot theirs, as we weren&apos;t really in touch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recently, we got another new employee.
		They&apos;re much more talkative though, so we spoke several times during that shift alone, and we&apos;ve shared many shifts together since.
		I tried the same prank on them too, hoping for better results.
		I kind of got cold feet though, and within a few minutes, I&apos;d told them I was kidding and given them my real name.
		It didn&apos;t stick though.
		They didn&apos;t catch that I&apos;d given them a fake name, so a while later, they were calling me &quot;Sam&quot;.
		I explained the prank a bit more clearly, and they got it this time.
		They don&apos;t seem stupid or anything, it was just such an odd and unexpected type of prank.
		It&apos;s been at least a couple weeks though, and despite knowing I&apos;m Alex, they can&apos;t stop thinking of me as Sam.
		The head manager told them to cover Alex&apos;s break, and they asked who that was.
		Within a couple seconds, they remembered who that was, and they laughed about thinking of me as Sam.
		This is hilarious.
		I definitely need to do this again, but preferably with yet a third non-binary name.

<section id="Wi-Fi">
	<h2>Wi-Fi connectivity</h2>
	<p>
		The availability of Wi-Fi connectivity in my entryway yesterday seems to have been nothing more than a fluke.
		I&apos;m back to having no reception anywhere in my home.
		Except, maybe, the living room.
		But that room&apos;s full of my mother&apos;s boxes she&apos;s having me store for her, so it&apos;s not exactly a usable room at the moment.
