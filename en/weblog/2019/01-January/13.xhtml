<section id="employment">
	<h2>Seeking employment</h2>
	<p>
		I guess my résumé&apos;s about as done as it&apos;s going to get, for now.
		I can&apos;t help but feel it looks rather empty, but then again, I don&apos;t have a whole lot of experience to include.
		I&apos;ve just finished up my associate degree, and I&apos;m looking for a less-toxic place to spend my work day.
		I guess today&apos;s a reasonable time to have the résumé finished.
		I was hoping to have it done yesterday, but I&apos;ve gotten it done in time for tomorrow, which will be Monday.
		I&apos;ll start my job search then.
	</p>

<section id="counterfeit">
	<h2>Counterfeit</h2>
	<p>
		While working the drive-through window today, someone tried to pay me using a counterfeit fifty.
		I&apos;ve never had anyone try to pass off fake money on me before!
		The only times I&apos;ve seen these fake bills is when some other employee accepts them into the register, and the head manager goes around showing everyone and explaining once again what to look for before accepting cash.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure how anyone was supposed to be fooled by this thing.
		It was too blue to be a real bill, and the print design just didn&apos;t have the right texture at all.
		I recognised it as fake right away, but I held it up to look for the anti-counterfeit strip anyway, probably mostly out of habit.
		I knew it wouldn&apos;t be there, and sure enough, it wasn&apos;t.
		The customer looked a bit confused and cancelled their order, but didn&apos;t seem to display any outrage.
		I guess they knew it was a fake and just hoped I wouldn&apos;t catch it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Come to think of it though, where do people even <strong>*get*</strong> fifties and hundreds?
		From credit unions and banks.
		No one gets them as change from purchases.
		The financial institutions of course know what to look for and don&apos;t give out fake money, so you won&apos;t be getting it from there.
		So in most cases, it&apos;s probably only the counterfeiter themself that has the bills; well, them and the businesses with checkers that fall for them.
		That means most people trying to spend fake bills probably know they&apos;re fake from the start.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve still got to wonder why people try to counterfeit big bills.
		The smaller ones have less security measures, so they&apos;re easier to fake.
		Furthermore, people aren&apos;t as likely to check the legitimacy of small bills.
		Personally, I know I only check fifties and hundreds myself.
		If you print small bills instead, you&apos;ll get away with more.
		Then again, maybe you won&apos;t.
		I mean, I notice this bill was fake before I even tried to check it.
		If the small bills are as badly printed as this, anyone with any intelligence and experience with the local currency will notice right away.

<section id="drawing">
	<h2>Drawing</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager told me today that I&apos;ve got to stop drawing on the order pads.
		The pads have this slip we put between order tickets to prevent the carbon paper below from picking up unrelated orders.
		The slip works just as well when drawn on, and I&apos;m not the only one who does it.
		I&apos;ve been doing it regularly for at least a week though, and I&apos;ve been getting fancy and using several colours.
		The head manager says that if the franchise owner comes in and sees, they&apos;ll get in trouble for allowing it, thinking that employees are drawing instead of getting their work done.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought that&apos;d be the end of it.
		No more drawing at work.
		However, the head manager then continued, explicitly giving me permission to keep doodling, as long as I found something else to doodle on.
		Sweet!
		They&apos;ve seen what I do.
		They&apos;ve seen I only draw while taking orders over the menu board speaker.
		(Well, and also on my breaks and sometimes a little before I clock in.)
		We don&apos;t actually use the order pads unless a customer is ordering something we don&apos;t currently have ready, so it&apos;s not like I need the pad open or I need to be writing with my hand.
		The head manager understands that there&apos;d be an exactly zero productivity increase from a ban on doodling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Drawing while I work seems to have been pretty therapeutic for me.
		I don&apos;t feel as stressed as I did previously, and I find I&apos;ve been smiling much more at work.
		Perhaps the boss noticed too, as he&apos;d commented on how down I&apos;d been before.
		So after work, I picked up a small sketchpad.
		This might actually help me relax even more.
		I&apos;ve been trying to finish one drawing each day.
		If I seem to be behind, I stress a bit and rush.
		I want to be able to finish what I start, and the pad might end up empty and thrown away before I next see it.
		I also stop drawing after one image is complete, thinking I won&apos;t have time to finish a second.
		With this pad though, drawing will be more leisurely.
		If I don&apos;t finish, it&apos;ll be fine.
		I&apos;ll still have my sketchbook on my next shift.
		If I finish early, I can start the next drawing, knowing again that I don&apos;t have a time limit within which to finish.
