<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 557 grams of Aztec salad, but for lunch, I had the 91 grams of cereal and 276 grams of soy milk I&apos;d normally have had for breakfast.
		I figured that by having the more substantial meal just before work, I wouldn&apos;t be as hungry at work.
		For dinner, I had 658 grams of the salad along with a banana.
	</p>

<section id="floss">
	<h2>Embroidery floss</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t think about how I needed to pick up some embroidery floss today until the last minute.
		I spent most of the morning relaxing and unwinding, even though I knew I should have been working on code for my hopefully soon-to-be-started Minetest server.
		I did remember in time to get to the craft store before work though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was able to get most of what I need, but they were sold out of three of the colours I&apos;m looking for.
		I asked the clerk if they knew when they&apos;d be getting more floss in.
		Apparently, they&apos;ve got some sort of inventory thing going on on Monday, which is when they normally get their shipments, so they won&apos;t be getting a shipment this week.
		Instead, their next shipment is on the Monday after that, which would be the seventeenth.
		I can&apos;t keep putting off helping the neighbour learn to cross stitch though.
		I&apos;ve got time for a little bit, so if they have time too, now&apos;s when we should do it.
		It&apos;ll be months before I have time again.
		I&apos;ll just have to not work on my project while showing them how to cross stitch, ans just bring over some of the supplies I&apos;ve already got.
		It&apos;ll be fine.
		I&apos;ll bring over a pattern that came with some floss I got a while back too, just in case they don&apos;t have one.
		I think they have some pattern books they&apos;ll want to use though.
		Still, it doesn&apos;t hurt to be prepared.
		I&apos;ll bring the aida and floss too, though again, I think they said they have some of both.
	</p>
	<p>
		The neighbour wasn&apos;t home, so I left them a note.
		I apologised for the delay in finding time, and said that if they still wanted to learn, I have mornings and afternoons available all week.
		They just need to let me know when works best for them.
		Truth be told, I actually did find time sooner, but they rejected my offer because they could see how busy I was at the time.
		They wanted this to be a way to unwind not just for themself, but for me too.
		I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be able to find this relaxing for a long time though.
		When school&apos;s in session, it drains me.
		When school&apos;s not in session, I&apos;m trying to ration my time to get done all the garbage I couldn&apos;t get done while school was in session due to being drained at the time.
		This break will be a less-stressful time to do it than usual though; the main thing happening during this break is that I have to sit on my hands and play the waiting game.

<section id="Woodward">
	<h2>Josh Woodward</h2>
	<p>
		Honestly, I really appreciate that Josh Woodward is the type of generous artist that would send his entire collection when I only asked for the single album I paid for, but my connection is terrible.
		The download broke several times today, and every time I restarted it, it started from the very beginning.
		Some servers will let you start from where the download broke, but his server isn&apos;t one of them.
		This is a waste of his bandwidth, not to mention that it&apos;d already be a waste of his bandwidth for me to get this entire archive when I&apos;ve already got it all, aside from the one album I asked for.
		It really would have worked out better to send just the one album, which would be a much smaller archive, not take as much bandwidth to begin with, and not break so many times.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, I had the archive mostly downloaded, but it was also nearly time to head to work.
		I thought I&apos;d have to cancel the download and start over later, as I need my laptop to be productive on my breaks at work.
		It&apos;s not like I really have time not to be productive.
		Journaling takes quite a lot of time.
		In the end though, the download broke again.
		I didn&apos;t even <strong>*need*</strong> to cancel it.
		Like I said, my connection is terrible, so large downloads are an absolute pain.
	</p>

<section id="competition">
	<h2>Competition</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager announced today that some of our competition is opening a pizza joint just down the street from ours.
		They talked about how they were going to be hard on us because they weren&apos;t going to let the other place &quot;steal&quot; our business.
		They made a pretty convincing speech that, even coming from them, I bought into it a bit at first.
		I mean, the head manager is pretty terrible - to the point he&apos;s completely killed my morale at this job - so he didn&apos;t have me rooting for us.
		However, he had me thinking that they competition was pretty shady, moving in on what was clearly our turf.
		After several minutes though, I&apos;d had time to think the situation over for myself.
		This is a <strong>*good*</strong> thing.
		This is competition in the market.
		Even if both businesses lose a bit, the <strong>*customers*</strong> win.
		Both companies are fighting over them, working to improve quality and perhaps even lower prices.
		Thinking we should have a monopoly over the area is toxic thinking, and I should really know better than to fall victim to it.
	</p>

<section id="chafing">
	<h2>No more chafing</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been noticing lately that even though summer&apos;s already here, I&apos;m not dying of heat like previous summers.
		In fact, I seem a bit cooler at work than I was even in the winter.
		Could it be because I&apos;m not as fat as I was?
		I mean, I&apos;m still too fat, but I&apos;ve got less blubber on me than I used to.
		I&apos;ve been getting better for a while, not just since the dietary meetings.
	</p>
	<p>
		So today, I decided to try an experiment.
		You may remember that last year, my chafing got so bad I had to start wearing different underwear at work than I do everywhere else, and that cleared up the problem.
		Today, I just wore my regular underwear, bringing the work underwear in my purse in case I needed to switch in the restroom on my break or something.
		But I didn&apos;t.
		I certainly got as sweaty as I usually do, but there wasn&apos;t any chafing issue.
		And here&apos;s the cool part: I got put on an oven-landing shift today.
		That&apos;s the hottest station in the store!
		If landing wasn&apos;t a problem, no other station should be.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought at first that the reduced blubber was keeping less heat in, which kept me cool enough not to chaf.
		That can&apos;t be it though.
		I was sweating up a storm, and it&apos;s the sweat, not the heat, that leads to chafing.
		It&apos;s likely instead that my legs aren&apos;t rubbing together so much because they&apos;re not as thick as they once were.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="bicycle">
	<h2>Bicycle failure</h2>
	<p>
		On my way home from work, I realised I&apos;d left the sandwich box I&apos;d brought my dinner in at work.
		I finished the trip home, changed my shirt, then headed back to work to grab it.
		On the second trip home, my gear shift line broke.
		What a pain.
		I&apos;ve never actually had that happen before though, in any of the number of years I&apos;ve biked, so I guess I should consider myself lucky because of that.
	</p>
	<p>
		At first, I figured I&apos;d just walk to work until I could get a new gear shift line and figure out how to install it.
		It&apos;d likely take until Monday to get the line, when the bike shop would be open.
		They might be open tomorrow too, but probably not.
		But then, I remembered I&apos;d made a commitment to go biking.
		I could technically miss a single day an not fail, but I&apos;m trying to not have to do that.
		I&apos;ll have to keep using the bike as it is for now.
		It&apos;s stuck in the high gear, so it&apos;s a pain to get going, but at least I can still travel quickly once I get going.
		I&apos;m not stuck in the low gear.
	</p>
	<p>
		I remembered though that I&apos;ve got a few scrap bikes.
		I could just take a gear shift line off of one of those, right?
		So I spent the last of the night trying to figure out how to remove the broken gear shift line.
