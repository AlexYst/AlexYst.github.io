	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 71 grams of cereal and 160 grams of soy milk.
		For dinner, I had 600 grams of spaghetti, cashew sauce, and veggie dog slices.
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, I didn&apos;t have time for lunch.
		I was running to Eugene to check on my vocal lesson application for part of the day, and spent most of my remaining free time writing up my journal entries for today, yesterday, and the day before.
		I took notes those past two days, but hadn&apos;t had time to formalise them into actual sentences and paragraphs for a journal entry, due to scrambling trying to get my bike fixed so I&apos;d have working transportation again.
		Instead, I had 260 grams of pretzels.
		After work, I was hungry, so I had a 273-gram plate of nachos.
		I&apos;ve still got refried beans left from last time I had nachos, so I figured I&apos;d use some of them up.
		I&apos;ll probably have another plate of nachos tomorrow to finish off what I&apos;ve got left before they spoil.
	</p>

<section id="bicycle">
	<h2>Bicycle repair</h2>
	<p>
		It was about midnight when I finished fixing and tuning my bike last night.
		I thought I&apos;d gotten it tuned correctly by the end of it, but it was dark, and I had to finish up outside where I could actually test ride it.
		It turns out I didn&apos;t get the gear shift line tuned correctly after all;; I can&apos;t switch into the lowest gear.
		I guess I&apos;ll leave it for now though.
		I don&apos;t really need the very lowest gear, I suppose, and I&apos;ve already spent so much time on this already.
		I need a break from it.
	</p>

<section id="voice">
	<h2>Vocal lessons</h2>
	<p>
		I stopped by the clinic in Eugene to check on my application for vocal lessons for the coming term.
		The receptionist couldn&apos;t tell me anything, and went to get their supervisor to see if they could find any information.
		They couldn&apos;t.
		So the receptionist took down my name, email address, and postal address, and said the head of the department (or someone, I forget exactly who) would get back to me.
		I asked about how long that&apos;d take, so I&apos;d know how long to wait before assuming I wasn&apos;t getting contacted and needed to come in again.
		They said it&apos;d be within a week.
	</p>
	<p>
		Within a week?
		A week is just about all I have!
		Hopefully this person does email me within that time frame so I know what&apos;s going on.
		And hopefully, my application&apos;s been approved.
		It&apos;s worth noting too that if I have to go in again next Monday, I might not have time for my embroidery floss run that same day.
		I might need to put that off until Tuesday.
		I suppose I should have checked on my application on Friday, after taking my final exams.
		I was already in the area, I just needed to go a bit further.
		I was still scattered from dealing with the term though, so I wasn&apos;t thinking clearly enough to get organised enough to plan that, let alone bring the map that would remind me where to find the clinic.
		Today&apos;s the first day they&apos;ve been open while I&apos;ve been semi-organised this break.
