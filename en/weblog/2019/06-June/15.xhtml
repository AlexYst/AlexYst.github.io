<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t really have breakfast today, and instead snacked on 156 grams of pretzels.
		For lunch, I had a protein shake.
		For dinner, I had 603 grams of spaghetti with chopped veggie dogs and cashew sauce.
		I also had a large carrot on one of my breaks at work.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m having second thoughts about my <code>elemental</code> mod.
		It&apos;s a step in the right direction, but it treats mining/farming experience as a material to be expended, not a continually-growing strength of the player.
		As such, it really doesn&apos;t capture what the original <code>minequest</code> had set out to do.
		It&apos;s a shame I&apos;ve already poured so much effort into getting the main system for this running, as I thin I&apos;m going to have to end the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		I keep doing this.
		I got the base system for <code>minequest</code> written several times, I might have gotten the base system for <code>minechest</code> written, and I definitely got the base system for <code>alchemy</code> written, but none of these mods actually do what I&apos;d like them to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess I have a new idea.
		Nodes can be crafted from several materials, and based on your mining/farming experience, the nodes owned by you somehow improve.
		For example, a special chest node might hole more items based on how many stacks of that chest&apos;s element you&apos;ve mined.
		I think I&apos;d still like to do warp points or checkpoints though, and I&apos;m not sure how to make the individual nodes for those any better.
		My only thought on that is to limit the number you&apos;re allowed to place and increase the limit as you mine and farm.

<section id="insurance">
	<h2>Insurance coverage</h2>
	<p>
		The Oregon Health Plan people wrote back.
		My coverage has been renewed.
		Now I&apos;m just waiting on the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> people and the voice clinic administrator.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was told the voice clinic administrator would contact me within a week though.
		They&apos;re not likely to contact me on a weekend, so it&apos;s clear that they&apos;re not planning to contact me within the stated time frame after all.
		So on Monday, I need to head back in and try again to see what&apos;s going on.
