<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 72 grams of cereal and 228 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had a 302-gram smoothie and 265 grams of pretzels.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;d planned to have muffuletta for dinner when I got home from work.
		I had a short shift today, and didn&apos;t need to bring my dinner to work.
		However, a workmate asked me to take over their closing shift.
		I was totally unprepared.
		Someone brought the crew popsicles though, and the boss was giving everyone 0.6-litre sodas because of the heat.
		With nothing else around, I had a popsicle and root beer for dinner.
		It really wasn&apos;t great.
		The soda actually made me feel ill for a bit, as my body&apos;s not used to soda any more, but the sugar kept me going until I could get home and get to bed.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="stuck">
	<h2>Stuck waiting</h2>
	<p>
		I felt like I couldn&apos;t get anything done today.
		I&apos;m just stuck waiting.
		I got the drawing number checked, but that&apos;s about all I could get done.
		I have things in the works, but they&apos;re all things I&apos;ve got to wait on at the moment.
		I&apos;m waiting for a response from the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company, one from the health insurance company, and one from the local university about vocal lessons.
		I could look into getting a home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair-removal kit, as I need one for the non-facial parts of my body.
		All the warnings said not to use them on male facial hair, so I&apos;m going to a doctor for that, but for the rest of my body, it&apos;d be cheaper to do it myself.
		I might go back to get my back done too, as that&apos;s hard to reach.
		But I don&apos;t want to start the body hair removal until I know the facial hair removal was a success, so that won&apos;t be for a while.
		I guess I could&apos;ve done some apartment-cleaning?
		I didn&apos;t really feel up to it though.
		I could have done some scripture-reading to work on my religion project, but I didn&apos;t think of that until after I&apos;d left for work.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I could have worked on code for Minetest mods I suppose.
		I&apos;ve been having second thoughts about my server setup lately though.
		Maybe I don&apos;t want to be a secret administrator.
		There are things I can do in-game that I can only do as an openly-known administrator.
		For example, I&apos;d love to have a major road project that connects distant areas.
		I&apos;d need to have some areas of the map reserved long before I can visit them and lay down protection nodes though.
		I wouldn&apos;t use administrative powers to spawn materials from nothing, and would still have to work for what goes into the road project, but it&apos;d be rather obvious that I&apos;m building in areas that other players seem to be magically barred from modifying.
		And if I&apos;m not a secret administrator, there&apos;s really no reason to finish the anonymous administrator contact system.
		Players can just talk to me themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did spend a lot of time thinking about the <code>elemental</code> mod though.
		For a bit, I decided on a more-professional plan for development.
		The craftbooks would be central to the whole release scheme.
		First of all, that meant that they would no longer be optional.
		I would <strong>*have*</strong> to find a way to program them.
		But as for being central, each craftbook would have an equal number of recipes, with every recipe (aside from the recipe for the craftbook itself) appearing in one of the craftbooks.
		That meant that for the time being, items would be added to the mod in sets of thirty.
		That seemed reasonable to me.
		And then as new elements were added, several new items would need to be added in order for the new craftbooks to &quot;catch up&quot;.
		And that&apos;s where things started to fall apart.
		The mod needs to be prepared to take on at least 256 elements.
		Compared to the current count of thirty elements, there&apos;s a drastic difference in how many recipes each book should hold.
		With 256 elements, there should only be one or at most maybe two recipes per book to avoid adding massive amounts of items to the game.
		On the other hand, at thirty elements, each book should eventually hold several recipes.
		The recipe book idea just doesn&apos;t scale unless I remove recipes from books sometimes and eventually probably even remove items that were previously-defined.
		I&apos;d rather not do that, so this craftbook idea is a total bust.
	</p>
	<p>
		It probably doesn&apos;t matter though.
		I was excited to get my server started, but I should really hol off a while longer to save more money.
		An Internet connection would be expensive, and I really don&apos;t need it for the time being if I put off setting up the server.
	</p>
	<p>
		I came up with a better idea though.
		First off, I think I do want to release this mod after all, outside the context of my own server.
		But secondly, I want the mod to be able to go into different &quot;modes&quot; to be able to handle different versions of the game.
		All stable versions of Minetest Game and Minimal should be supported, along with Build and Survival from 0.4.6.
		I plan to support all the elements from these games anyway, so it shouldn&apos;t be too hard to support subsets.
		The main differences between the modes would be which elements show up in the interface, which items are renewed by catalyst stones, and what items are used in crafting recipes.
		I should be able to set a few variables based on some checks and support all of these subgames.
		It&apos;ll be fun to dive into older versions of Minetest Game too and learn more of what&apos;s changed over the years.
		I don&apos;t imagine Minimal&apos;s changed very much, but hey, I might learn that it has.

<section id="work">
	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Today was not a great work day.
		My neck and back were sore, though that would mostly would only be a problem at the end of the night.
		At least the head manager was away though.
		It&apos;s their day off today, so I didn&apos;t have to deal with their garbage.
	</p>
	<p>
		First of all, I didn&apos;t bring dinner to work today.
		I was scheduled for a short shift.
		After work, I planned to pick up the deli slices I needed for muffuletta, which I&apos;d forgotten when I picked up the bread on a whim.
		I figured I&apos;d either have a plate of nachos or a slice of muffuletta for dinner, and there just wasn&apos;t a good reason to try to prepare something before I got home.
		But then, a workmate asked me to take over their closing shift.
		Lovely.
		I didn&apos;t have anything to eat, and I&apos;d be getting off at 23:00.
		The grocery store would be closed, so I couldn&apos;t pick up my deli slices, and I wasn&apos;t sure how I&apos;d even make it to close without food anyway.
		I hadn&apos;t exactly had a great lunch even.
	</p>
	<p>
		Someone brought the crew popsicles though, and the boss was giving out 0.6-litre sodas, so one of each became my dinner.
		I can&apos;t stand the carbonation of soda, but I thought the sugar might keep me going.
		I mean, soda was a part of what made me fat.
		Surely the sugar it contains could keep me going for a while, right?
		My hunch was right on, but it came at a cost.
		My body&apos;s not used to soda, so I felt a bit ill for a while.
		Still, my energy level was soon brought back up, and I wasn&apos;t actually hungry the rest of the night.
		I didn&apos;t think a soda and a popsicle would sustain me as well as they did.
		I thought I&apos;d need more, but I really didn&apos;t.
		It was a terrible dinner though, not to mention no doubt not at all nutritious, and I don&apos;t want a repeat of that any time soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s funny; I work at a restaurant, yet we have nothing to eat.
		It&apos;s all got ingredients not suitable for my herbivorous diet.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started out the work day flattening dough.
		That was fine, though it seemed we were understaffed tonight or something.
		I could barely keep up with demand.
		I had no chance of getting ahead.
		Most of the time, I didn&apos;t have help; usually, two people work the dough-flattening station, but I worked alone.
		At the end of the night though, I got sent to work the drive-through window.
		The drive-through window isn&apos;t a problem whenever the head manager isn&apos;t around making life worse.
		And today, they weren&apos;t.
		But the drive-through worker is responsible for washing the dishes.
		Morning crew didn&apos;t wash their dishes, so we had their dishes plus our own, and as we didn&apos;t seem to have enough people, the person working drive before me hadn&apos;t gotten as many done as they would have liked to.
		Normally, when the drive-through is swamped and the drive-through worker isn&apos;t able to continually wash dishes, someone else is sent back to help with the dish situation.
		But no.
		We didn&apos;t have the people to spare for that.
	</p>
	<p>
		So there we were at closing time, still with a mound of dishes left.
		I&apos;d worked on them between customers as possible, but I&apos;d started out with too many and had had too little time to work on them.
		One of the managers stayed late with me while I finished the dishes, but they just sat on a table playing on their mobile, not helping get anything done.
		Look, I get that we can&apos;t both wash dishes at the same time.
		We&apos;ve got exactly one spray hose to work with.
		However, when I brought the washed dishes back to the front of the store, I found so many things up front not set up for tomorrow morning!
		I&apos;d been frantically scrambling to get the dishes washed, with my neck ache and backache growing worse as I did so, and the boss&apos;d been sitting around doing nothing.
		So I continued my mad scramble finishing up the front of the store too.
	</p>
	<p>
		The boss came up behind me as I was finishing up and asked if I was ready to leave.
		Seriously?
		You&apos;ve been sitting around, and you think I&apos;m at all ready to go?
		I explained I still had a couple more things to take care of, and in frustration, I also mentioned several other tasks I&apos;d had to do up here that they could have done while I finished the dishes.
		Like, seriously.
		They could have finished every task left in the front three or four times in the time it took me to finish the dishes.
		I didn&apos;t mention that they could have done those tasks though, I was just sort of hoping they&apos;d get that they could have been out of here sooner if they&apos;d actually done anything to help.
		We ended up getting out of the store about forty-five minutes after closing time.
		It turns out that they had a headache, but they could have easily performed these tasks so we could get out of there.
		I was scrambling like mad with a neck-and-backache, and the scramble only made it worse.
		Sitting around while someone else works like mad really isn&apos;t cool.
		It was nearly midnight by the time I got home.
	</p>

<section id="plans">
	<h2>Plans</h2>
	<p>
		I guess my main plan for tomorrow is to take a long bike ride.
		The river has two paths, one on each side of it, for a total of four path ends.
		I&apos;ve only been to three of them.
		It&apos;d be interesting to see what&apos;s on the fourth end, and checking would be a good excuse to get in some exercise.
		The neighbour still hasn&apos;t said a word about whether they&apos;re still interested in learning to cross stitch, either.
		I&apos;ve actually seen neither hide nor hair of them lately.
	</p>
	<p>
		I could also work on reading and commenting on Genesis, I suppose.
		And I could work more on planning <code>elemental</code>.
		There&apos;s lots left to do on both projects, actually.
