	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For people reading this entry close to when it was posted, I should explain what these daily &quot;dietary intake&quot; sections are.
		I explained before, but as of the time of writing this, that entry is under censorship by the school, and this is the first uncensored entry since then.
		Basically, I&apos;m seeing a dietician right now because I&apos;m way too fat.
		One thing they recommended was recording what and how much I eat.
		It holds me accountable, and makes me try to eat less.
		This journal is where I record everything, so it&apos;s where I&apos;ve been keeping my dietary intake logs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve set three goals with my dietician so far.
		The first is the aforementioned logging of what I eat.
		I can eat whatever I like with no hard limits, but I&apos;ve got to be accountable for every bite.
		Second, I&apos;m to plan out my dinners every night.
		I&apos;m no longer allowed to wait until the last minute when I need to rush to work and just grab whatever&apos;s handy.
		If I don&apos;t eat out, which is most of the time, I&apos;ve got to actually take the time to make something.
		That said, recipes are often designed with families in mind, so being single, they often make more than I&apos;d need for dinner.
		I often make things in bulk, and have the same thing for multiple dinners and/or for multiple meals throughout the day.
		Planning meals doesn&apos;t mean planning unique meals, and if it did, I&apos;d both not have time for it and have to throw out perfectly good food when I don&apos;t have a use for, for example, three quarters of an onion, after scaling a recipe.
		Honestly, I&apos;d just save the partial ingredients, but they&apos;d often spoil before I found a use for them.
		Third, I&apos;m to go no more than one day in a row without at least twenty minutes of biking.
		I&apos;m aiming for every day without fail, and so far I&apos;ve done that, but there is a little wiggle room for if something comes up.
	</p>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 277 grams of Aztec salad, 333 grams for lunch, and 346 more grams for dinner.
		While that salad&apos;s delicious, it&apos;s also not very sustaining, so I snacked on 201 grams of pretzels throughout the day.
		On the way home from the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, I found my strength failing me, so I ate an energy bar.
		Honestly, even getting <strong>*to*</strong> the meeting was a struggle.
		I should have had more carbs today!
		Tomorrow, I&apos;ll obviously have the salad again for dinner, but I should probably find something else for the other two meals for some variety.

	<h2>Religious study</h2>
	<p>
		The missionaries bailed on me again.
		They said they can&apos;t come Saturday, and asked if there was a time between now and then we could meet.
		That&apos;s literally only one day.
		I explained I have my final exam in Eugene tomorrow, so that&apos;s not really going to work.
		I forgot to mention I also have work that day.
		Oh, well.

<section id="Woodward">
	<h2>Josh Woodward</h2>
	<p>
		Josh Woodward has a new crowd-funding campaign, this time for an album called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshwoodward/josh-woodward-the-shade-from-our-trees">The Shade from Our Trees</a>.
		I&apos;m reluctant to back it, seeing as he never delivered the <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files he promised when I backed his <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshwoodward/josh-woodward-addressed-to-the-stars">Addressed to the Stars</a> album.
		I still haven&apos;t gotten a chance to listen to that album.
		Still, I threw money at his new campaign as a show of good faith.
		Then I wrote to him again, asking if, after three years, I could finally get those <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files.
		I explained that I wrote to him before, when he initially sent <abbr title="MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr>s but no <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr>s, but with the recent release at that time, my letter probably got lost in the mess of other emails he was no doubt dealing with because of the release or he was maybe too busy with other things coming up because of the release.
		Hopefully this time he writes back, and hopefully with the long-awaited <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> files.
		If not, I might withdraw my backing from this new campaign (not that I told him that though).
		I mean, I didn&apos;t even get what I paid for last time, so if I&apos;m not going to get that, I have little reason to believe I&apos;ll get what I&apos;d be paying for this time either.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hilariously, he set his funding goal to a single dollar.
		With the following he has, he <strong>*has*</strong> to know he&apos;ll more than beat that goal.
		He&apos;s already at over one thousand times that, and it hasn&apos;t even been a day yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another artist I used to follow also wrote to me today asking me to back their campaign.
		Funny timing.
		That artist no longer releases their work under free licenses though, meaning that their work is no longer worth my money, not to mention that I shouldn&apos;t encourage such proprietary releases by funding them.
		Woodward gets my funding because he&apos;s still on the side of the free culture community.

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		My advisor finally wrote back to me <strong>*on the day final exams start*</strong> about my question on how to fix the proctor information so I can get my proctor appointment set up.
		It&apos;s a good thing I gave up waiting for them already, or I&apos;d be panicking by now.
		Anyway, it turns out they didn&apos;t want me to fix anything.
		That doesn&apos;t mean waiting several days to answer me was fine though, as if I was waiting on that answer this whole time, I&apos;d be in a world of hurt right now trying to find a time my proctor could see me that I also actually had available during the testing period.
		The advisor said they just want me to use the updated information for any future proctored courses I take.
		However, this is my final proctored term, so all this was is just a time-waster.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;d planned to get my learning journal assignment submitted yesterday, but I wasn&apos;t feeling up to finishing it.
		So I got that finished up today.
	</p>
	<p>
		After finishing that final assignment, I thought I&apos;d get a jump start on my final exams.
		I have the one proctored exam tomorrow, but the unproctored exam  has a more flexible time frame.
		Much to my surprise though, I found <strong>*both*</strong> exams seem to require a proctor.
		Previously, I didn&apos;t recall which one required one, and the school&apos;s website is so obnoxiously difficult to get information from that I finally gave up after at least half an our of trying to get the information from the website.
		Instead, I checked my copy of the course catalogue.
		It told me only one exam was proctored, and that matched what I thought I remembered.
		It looks like that copy of the course catalogue is out of date though.
		I guess I&apos;ll be taking both exams tomorrow then.
