	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 68 grams of cereal and 276 grams of soy milk.
		When I got home from testing, I had 535 grams of Aztec salad as a snack, I ended up having 454 grams of it for lunch too, as I wanted to work on file-sorting instead of preparing a meal.
		And finally, as planned, I had 605 grams of it for dinner, as I said I would yesterday.
		I had 144 grams of pretzels throughout the day as well.

	<h2>Drudgery</h2>

		These last two times I went in for proctoring, I paid in cash, and got much more reasonable rates.
		There&apos;s either a bug in the computerised payment system, which requires one to pay the full fee twice if you take two tests, even if you don&apos;t hit the three and a half hour limit the fee covers, or the people accepting cash aren&apos;t trained to take multiple tests into account like they should and only charge based on the time taken.
		Either way, I wish I&apos;d known sooner.
		I&apos;d&apos;ve saved quite a bit of money.
		Aside from the halved fee, the final exams were rather uneventful.

<section id="paperwork">
	<h2>Paperwork</h2>
	<p>
		A week or two ago, the Oregon Health Plan people sent me a request that I reverify my income level.
		I was far too busy to deal with that at the time, but now school&apos;s out, so I got my tax return printed at the local library so I could mail it to them.
		I&apos;d rather have put it off until tomorrow, so as to have an errand to run tomorrow and an excuse to get in some extra exercise, seeing as I already biked to Eugene for my final exams, but getting this done was important and shouldn&apos;t be put off any longer.
		I need to get out of that mindset of trying to break up errands though.
		Things come up, and if I haven&apos;t run the errands I need to, it can come back to bite me.
		A better strategy would be to find other excuses to get out on days I don&apos;t have errands, assuming I don&apos;t outright make up errands instead.
		I mean, I nearly always have at least one or two bottles to return for deposit, if I&apos;ve got nothing else to go out and do.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was getting the tax return printed, I also printed out a letter to my <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company asking them to change the name on my account from my birth name to my legal name, then as I was headed to the post office to deal with the healthcare people&apos;s documents, I mailed the letter to the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company along with the certified copy of my change-of-name document that I bought months ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of paperwork, I&apos;ve now gone through my entire paperwork drawer and sorted out all the stuff I can just throw out.
		I haven&apos;t files away the things I&apos;m keeping yet, but maybe I can get to that too at some point during my break from school.

		Josh Woodward wrote back today.
		He sent the links to the archives of his entire collection!
		If I hadn&apos;t already bought the full collection years ago, it&apos;d be quite a deal!
		I&apos;m pretty sure all I&apos;m missing though is Addressed to the Stars and maybe a few select songs he released outside of albums since then.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though it was very generous for him to send me the archives to everything (he&apos;s probably forgotten that I&apos;ve got it all aside from the one album, seeing as I&apos;m just one random fan), it&apos;s actually a bit of a downer when it comes to archival.
		First, it&apos;s going to take me hours to download this.
		There are three archives, and they&apos;ve got everything.
		One&apos;s his normal work, which&apos;ll no doubt have the album I&apos;m looking for, but it&apos;ll take over three hours to download.
		Then it&apos;ll take up space redundantly on my external drive because I already have the individual album ZIPs,  which he used to offer, on that drive.
		And I can&apos;t throw out the individual ZIPs, because they&apos;re so much more convenient than a bulk everything ZIP.
		The second archive he sent me a link to contains all the instrumental versions he&apos;s released.
		I&apos;m not even sure what the third ZIP is.
		I might not even have its contents yet, but I guess I&apos;ll find out when I download it.
