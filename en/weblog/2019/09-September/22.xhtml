	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that the head manager at work gave me a computer speaker, and told me I needed to set it up to receive telephone calls on it.
		I guess they wanted me to buy a mobile and connect the speaker to it.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		Mainly, I used my in-game time today to farm snow, and in the process, get logs for the bridge as well.
		I also set up stacks of pine needles to be auto-mined while I watched videos of someone else playing minetest.
		I guess mostly, I just needed to relax today.

	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Today, the head manager said that both the other shift-leader-in-training and I had &quot;graduated&quot;, which I assume means that we officially have the approval of the person in charge of the franchise, who is the final decider of who makes the cut and not.
		A bit later, the head manager headed home, and left the two of us to close the store.
		The other shift leader had joked about sending the head manager home, but I didn&apos;t think we&apos;d actually be left alone in the store yet.
		I mean, when the other shift leader brought it up, I knew right away I was more than ready for it.
		I just didn&apos;t think the head manager had put that much trust in us yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, closing went well, as we&apos;d predicted.
		The system did get a bit buggy on us though.
		I performed the inventory count on paper, as we always do, then entered it into the computer.
		But later, I saw the computer claim it hadn&apos;t been entered.
		So I entered it again.
		It still didn&apos;t save properly.
		The other shift leader tried a couple times, and I tried once more.
		We&apos;d tried a total of five times, and the buggy system wouldn&apos;t take the counts.
		We couldn&apos;t figure out what was going on.
		I&apos;ve entered counts multiple times in the past, so I know I was doing it right.
		And the other shift leader knows how to do it too, so there&apos;s no reasonable answer here except that the system was being screwy.
		Of course, we already know the system is screwy, we just haven&apos;t encountered this particular issue before.
		Anyway, we left a note for morning crew&apos;s shift leaders, in case not having the counts entered messes with the morning routine somehow.
		I&apos;ll talk to the head manager about the issue when I see them tomorrow.
