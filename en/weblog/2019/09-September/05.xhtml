	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I felt something tiny crawling on my chest, and I flung it off with my hand.
		It turned out to be a really strange-looking spider, which then ran in a bizarre way away across the carpet.
		I then felt something on the inside of my elbow, and I almost tried to fling that away too.
		Before I could though, I recognised what I was feeling and stopped.
		It was a cat licking me, and its facial fur was brushing up against my skin as it did so.
		Somehow, the ca was invisible though, so I wasn&apos;t able to see it, only feel it.
	</p>

<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		I was up a bit later than I should have been due to a headache.
		I thought maybe it was because I needed energy after that long bike ride, so I had 375 grams of orange juice and 209 grams of muffuletta.
		That didn&apos;t help though; it was probably just a stress headache.
		I should have known better.
		I mean, I didn&apos;t feel hungry or anything.
		For breakfast, I had 250 grams of muffuletta and 387 grams of orange juice.
		For lunch, I had 212 grams of muffuletta and 404 grams of orange juice.
		For dinner, I had 309 grams of muffuletta.

<section id="iptables">
	<h2><code>iptables</code></h2>
	<p>
		My main goal for the day was simple: write up a <a href="https://redmine.replicant.us/boards/9/topics/15390">short post asking about the presence of <code>iptables</code> on Replicant 6.0</a>.
		I&apos;ve actually been meaning to do that for a while now, but it&apos;s gotten more urgent now that I have a working battery for the device.
	</p>

<section id="key">
	<h2>Broken key</h2>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I pulled out my broken bike lock key and thought about how I might be able to string some thin wire through a tiny hole it has to bind it to my key ring.
		I don&apos;t have any thin wire though.
		Now, I can&apos;t find that key.
		I&apos;m not sure if I took it with me when I went out on my long ride yesterday.
		And if I did, I&apos;m not sure if I had it when I got back.
		I used to keep the key in the small pocket of my purse until the purse became too damaged to use, at which point I started putting it in my backpack.
		It was actually today when I went to move the key to the small pocket of my new purse that I noticed that I didn&apos;t know where it was.
		I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve lost it or it&apos;s still around.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, the new keys are scheduled to arrive.
		I&apos;m guessing they&apos;ll be late though.
		Packages nearly always seem to come a little early or a little late, never on the actual final day of the estimated arrival period.
		For now, I&apos;m using a weaker lock to lock the bike up, which really isn&apos;t the best of options.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/05.png" alt="My new spawn area seems to be a desert." class="framed-centred-image" width="809" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve re-implemented a rudimentary form of <code>liblevelup</code>&apos;s counting mechanic in Minetest 0.4.0, in a very hacky way.
		Again.
		I&apos;ll add more of <code>liblevelup</code>&apos;s features as I need them, but the counting had to be there from the beginning so early drops wouldn&apos;t go uncounted.
		From here, the plan is to just play the game as usual, gathering materials to make the elemental nodes while I plan out their designs.
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing I remembered about older versions of the game is that leaf decay affects leaves regardless of whether those leaves were placed there by the player.
		If I was going to build my grinding tower, there would need to be a pillar of logs embedded in it to prevent the leaves from dying before I could get to them.
		I started to build the log pillar, which wasn&apos;t very high for now because I hadn&apos;t cut down many trees.
		I went to test the setup though and found that holding the right mouse button doesn&apos;t cause the character to repeatedly place nodes.
		That feature is vital to my setup!
		Wow.
		I didn&apos;t realise that was a recent(ish) feature.
		I assumed it was always the way things had worked.
		I guess I&apos;m going back to grinding the old fashion way: building up the tower, mining it all away while I&apos;m away from the keyboard, and building it back up again when I get back.
		It&apos;s much slower, but it&apos;s a tried and true method none the less.
		Honestly though, this is why I went back to play old versions of the game: to learn these things.
		Otherwise, I could just look at the available items in the old versions, but develop and play using the new versions.
		With this new understanding of the pain of grinding in older versions of the game, it makes me want to make one of the elemental items that represents this time period act as a grinder.
		Perhaps when a sapling is substituted for the iron in a locked chest, you get a grinding chest, as it&apos;s only saplings that have this property in Minetest Game 0.4.0.
		To even get one of these chests, you&apos;ll need to have already worked at grinding a lot of saplings - or perhaps had leaf decay do it for you.
		You&apos;ll need 4059 saplings just to build the node that lets you work with the sapling element, then another sapling to actually substitute into the chest.
		I&apos;m not sure how levels should affect auto-grinding though, especially because auto-grinding is partly about getting levels in the first place.
	</p>
	<p>
		I built textures for the refinery nodes, which for now I&apos;m calling &quot;pedestals&quot; for lack of a better word, and found that Minetest 0.4.0 oddly couldn&apos;t handle dashes in texture names.
		I&apos;m not sure what that&apos;s about.
		I ended up swapping the dashes out for full stops though, which I assumed would work because of the usual dots before the file extension, and that seems to work fine.
		Maybe dots are a better option anyway.
