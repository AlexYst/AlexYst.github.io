		For breakfast, I had 529 grams of Aztec salad.
		As a snack, I had 142 grams of muffuletta.
		For lunch, I had 551 grams of Aztec salad.
		I had two glasses of vanilla almond milk, one of 284 grams and one of 271 grams.
		For dinner, I had 637 grams of Aztec salad.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I barely had time today to get my <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment in before work.
		Even without school, I really wouldn&apos;t have time or patience for full-body treatment all at once.
		It really was for the best that I decided to break this up into several sections to work on in different waves.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of the missed term though, it really would have been nice to have gotten into vocal therapy this term.
		With the term off from school, I&apos;d have more energy to put toward practice.
		Besides, it&apos;d be nice to be doing <strong>*something*</strong> to move forward, instead of just sitting on my hands.

<section id="Freya">
	<h2>Freya</h2>
	<p>
		I got the money handed off to Freya today.
		That brings her debt to me up to $1450 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		It sounds like she still intends to pay me back though; I&apos;d assumed after she was fired, I&apos;d never see her or my money again.
		I&apos;m not sure how she intends to pay me back though when she chooses to continue living from pay cheque to pay cheque.
		I mean, even once she&apos;s got a new job, she chooses to think of pay day as the the day she&apos;s got money instead of trying to make that money last.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/14.png" alt="Seven elemental crystals on pillars on the ice" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I got lost in my test world, so I had to take the screenshot in an icy area.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I wrote up code to give players an elemental pillar once they&apos;ve mined forty-one stacks of the respective element, and initially coded the pillars to be owned by that particular player even when not placed in the world.
		I also coded them to keep track of how many of the elemental item the were storing even once dug up, so you could take them with you without emptying them first.
		Now though, I&apos;ve removed both those features.
		You have to empty them to move them, and you&apos;re free to give them to other players if you so choose.
	</p>
	<p>
		I considered adding other features to these elemental crystals to make them more desirable to players.
		For example, I considered allowing players to warp to them.
		I opted against that though.
		If I made them into warp points, I wouldn&apos;t build out my infrastructure because I wouldn&apos;t need it.
		At this point, I&apos;m half considering taking <strong>*away*</strong> their only feature: their storage capacity.
		I mean, theoretically, if I&apos;ve got so much storage in the elemental crystals, I&apos;m not going to build out my treasury, right?
		I don&apos;t think this is actually the case though.
		The main things I&apos;d get a break from using these crystals are my saplings, my mushrooms, and my flint.
		Without the increased storage space, I&apos;d waste my saplings as furnace fuel again, not build more space to hold them.
		And the mushrooms and flint are garbage to me.
		I wouldn&apos;t build a treasury for them, but instead either embed chest for them in places not meant to look nice or literally build a landfill for them.
		I don&apos;t get anywhere close to enough of the other elements to worry about space concerns.
		I probably won&apos;t give elemental sand crystals that wildcard feature I&apos;d planned though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think in my new world, I&apos;ll set up more of a permanent base of operations in the spawn area instead of just a makeshift one while trying to escape the island.
		I&apos;ll probably name the place &quot;Snow Haven&quot;, &quot;Sand Haven&quot;, or something like that.
