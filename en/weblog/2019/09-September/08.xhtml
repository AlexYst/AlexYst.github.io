	<p>
		Today&apos;s goal was to figure out what to do with the bucket-based items.
		A couple things were important to keep in mind when trying to plan these items.
		First, I wanted to take the opportunity to allow the liquid within the bucket to become a part of the final result.
		If you take the iron out of a bucket that contains lava and replace it with saplings, you shouldn&apos;t simply get a sapling-based item that is storing lave, but instead a sapling-based something that incorporates the lava in some way.
		This means that the empty bucket item couldn&apos;t simply be a bucket that&apos;s ready to accept a material.
		Second, non-renewable liquids hadn&apos;t been added to the engine at this point in time.
		As adding ways to renew elements through liquid-renewal mechanics was outside the scope of this mod and should be avoided, any mix that included a non-sapling element couldn&apos;t produce a liquid.
		These things all need to produce solid nodes aside from the plants, which I wanted to make solid nodes anyway just because of the ideas I had for them (watermelons and - you guessed it - lava melons).
	</p>
	<p>
		After working out what to do with the buckets for a while, I realised I was going about planning this mod all wrong though.
		The goal of the element-draining process was to recover elements.
		That would allow me to not have to fear using my elemental items.
		For example, if I need to move a lot of lava, I&apos;m more likely to do it one or two buckets at a time so I don&apos;t have to craft forty-one buckets, most of which I&apos;d never use again, wasting all that iron.
		As it is, I avoid using iron mostly, conserving it for use in powered rails and locked chests.
		Yes, a remnant object is left behind, and the remnant can be combined with another element to create something new and unusual, but the remnant nodes aren&apos;t the purpose of the draining process.
		With that in mind, players should be required to reverse the process as much as they can before the pedestal will drain the item of its elemental material.
		In the case of the buckets, that means emptying them.
		There shouldn&apos;t be remnant versions of the full buckets.
	</p>
	<p>
		I put aside thinking of ideas to think long and hard about what I was actually looking for from this mod.
		I ended up throwing out all my previous ideas.
		For the torch remnant combined with iron, I&apos;d come up with makeshift hooks that can hold only a single partial stack of items, with the maximum stack size being based on your level.
		Being iron-based, it would protect that stack from theft, but a basic locked chest would be more iron-efficient and space-efficient.
		For the sand-element one, I&apos;d decided on a wall-mounted node that when placed, replaces the node you tried to place it on.
		For the sapling-based one, I&apos;d come up with a flower that grows on walls.
		It&apos;d probably be dainty and white, and would be called a &quot;wallflower&quot;; a bit of a pun.
		It would keep track of the level you were when you placed it, and slowly grow up to that many wall-mounted leaf sprouts nearby.
		For the re-element-ed rail remnants, I was planning to make ember rails, glass rails, and creeper rails.
		Ember rails would be made with coal, and would have glowing coals instead of the metal part of the rail.
		Glass rails would have glass instead of metal, but also, they replace what you try to put them on.
		Creeper rails would have their metal replaced with creeper vines, and these rails would actually spawn more creeper rails around them.
		The level you were when you placed the initial rail would be remembered, and the offshoots would grow up to that length.
		They&apos;d be a different node though, with a slightly different texture, and if you placed them elsewhere, they would not continue to grow.
		Out of the locked chest remnant, you could make flame chests, glass-lock chests, or pod plants.
		All three of these would have inventory sizes based on your current level.
		Flame chests would simply emit light, and would appear to be covered in dancing flames.
		With coal instead of iron though, they wouldn&apos;t protect your stuff.
		Glass-lock chests would be identical to regular, unlocked chests with the exception that they would lack the safeguard that prevents you from digging up a chest if its inventory is full, so if you thoughtlessly dug it up without emptying it, you&apos;d lose all your stuff.
		Again, this chest lacks iron, so it doesn&apos;t protect your stuff from theft either.
		Obviously, this is the sand-element chest, and as usual, sand is the worst element.
		The pod plants would be interesting.
		They wouldn&apos;t have inventories themselves, and would just be a stem coming out of the ground with four branches, one going out in each of the four compass directions.
		Every once in a while, a plant pod would spawn on one of these branches, and it&apos;s these pods that have the inventory space.
		You can dig up the pods and move them elsewhere, basically creating an inventory node farm.
		Again, no iron though, so no protection against theft.
		For the steel block remnant, I&apos;d decided to make a coal block with either live flames or embers, a glass block with a different texture, and thin, clustered trees.
		The glass block would have a three-by-three grid of squares on each side.
		The clustered trees would be nine thine trunks in a three-by-three grid, separated by a pixel of air, and with leaves growing in a few  places on them.
		There would be a node that grows by placing an inert node in its former position and putting itself one node higher, resulting in the thin tree cluster getting taller and taller until a time you decide to stop it by removing it.
		There&apos;d be no limit to the growth, as long as there was empty air above it.
		Finally, the glass remnant and the ingot remnant would be the same item, which I was going to call &quot;char&quot;
		When used with one of the other two elements, you&apos;d get a glass heart or flame glass.
		Flame glass, the coal version, would just be red-orange, glowing glass with a flame-like texture.
		Come to think of it, I could animate the flame, but I hadn&apos;t planned to do that, and was only thinking of a static texture.
		The sapling version, the glass heart, would be an apple-red glass node with an apple-like texture.
		It would slowly spawn in either glass leaves or glass branches though, with a range based on your level when you&apos;d placed the node.
		None of these ideas will be implemented in this mod though.
		I&apos;m throwing them all out.
		I might revisit some of these ideas later though, potentially in another mod.
		In particular, I like the idea of inventing new plants; of inventing new crops to farm.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only idea I&apos;m keeping from my plans is the pedestals themselves, though I&apos;m now calling them &quot;banks&quot; instead.
		However, I&apos;ll have them store all of the items you can obtain.
		Each item will be associated with a specific element, and the bank for that element will be the only type of bank that can store that item.
		To have infinite storage of all items, you need to acquire one of each of the banks.
		Also, because banks are gotten from mining or farming, you can&apos;t infinitely store some materials if you let leaf decay do all the work for you in gathering saplings.
		If you want the sapling bank, you&apos;re going to have to mine a bunch of saplings out of leaf nodes by hand.
		I need to take the time to classify each base item as being associated with a specific element, then classify everything built up from those base items as being of the same element.
		There are going to be some rare cases that I can&apos;t cleanly keep as the same element like that though.
		For example, torches contain coal and wood, and locked chests contain iron and wood.
		Should wood be of the coal element or the iron element?
		At the same time though, I&apos;d classify wood as being of the sapling element instead of either, seeing as wood comes from grown saplings.
		For the most part, I can keep crafts together this way though.
		For example, papyrus can be crafted along with wood into bookshelves, but can&apos;t be crafted with any other element, so papyrus has to be of the sapling element.
		I&apos;ll probably ad special crafts that can only be done at the banks using only items that are associated with that particular bank.
		That&apos;s more likely to happen later on though.
		First, I should get the base work done.

	<h2><code>localectl</code></h2>
	<p>
		I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to set my system&apos;s time locale.
		I&apos;d managed to get Thunderbird to display dates in a tolerable format months ago, though not exactly my preferred format of YYYY-MM-DD, if I recall.
		But then some update messed it up, and I never went back and tried to fix it again.
		Obnoxiously, Thunderbird doesn&apos;t simply let you set this, and requires you to set a system locale that has the time format you want, if you can even find one.
		I&apos;ve experimented with several locales, and found one with dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format I like and found one with the time format I like, which is twenty-four hour time, but no locales that have both, so no way to get both in Thunderbird.
		In my experiments though, I&apos;ve had to open Thunderbird from the command line after setting the <var>LC_TIME</var> variable.
		And setting the locale that way kept giving me error messages.
		Today, I tried for a few hours to get that set as my actual system time locale so I don&apos;t have to open Thunderbird from the command line, and without errors.
	</p>
	<p>
		I worked a lot with the <code>localectl</code> command, which seems to be the preferred method of setting the LC_* variables in a more-permanent way.
		However, the command kept complaining about timeouts.
		I couldn&apos;t figure out what could possibly be timing out or why, but after a while, network timeouts came to mind.
		Was <code>localectl</code> trying to access the network?
		Why would it do that though?
		Surely it wasn&apos;t trying to access the network just to set the local machine&apos;s locale.
		I tried using <code>torsocks</code> to find out if network access was indeed the problem.
		If it was, that might make it work.
		What I found was that <code>torsocks</code> output a bunch of error messages about how <code>localectl</code> was trying to go around the proxy <code>torsocks</code> was enforcing, but <code>torsocks</code> was (correctly) responding by blocking the access attempts.
		What the Squid?
		Why is <code>localectl</code> trying to access the network!?
		It&apos;s no wonder it&apos;s timing out though.
		The firewall is protecting the system from <code>localectl</code>&apos;s attempts to leak data over an insecure channel.
		I&apos;m at a loss as to what to do.
		I&apos;ve tried the <code>update-locale</code> command too, but that complains about my locals being invalid.

	<h2>Promotion</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager gave me the final key today.
		That was quick.
		I thought it&apos;d take longer to get it back from the former assistant manager.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today was a bit of a mess.
		Due to my own lack of skill, I wasn&apos;t able to properly deal with having the new recruit I was working with on landing with me.
		I could have easily done the job single-handedly, but they kept coming to right where I was working, spreading out, and taking their time, greatly slowing me down as the conveyor belt continued to bring us pizzas at a steady pace.
		I couldn&apos;t really fault them, as they were just learning how to work in this store in the first place.
		They haven&apos;t built up the speed that I have.
		Finally, about halfway through the shift, I realised what I needed to do.
		I had to put them on another task.
		I had them take care of the breadsticks that were coming out, which got them away from the pizzas so I could work in peace.
		The breadsticks weren&apos;t urgent.
		The bread treys can be stacked and set aside foe a while.
		The pizzas coming out were definitely urgent though, so I told them to work on the breads so they&apos;d stop slowing me down; so I could catch up with how far behind they&apos;d already made us.
		I&apos;m terrible at this management thing.
		It took me way too long to come up with that.
		But I&apos;m learning.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve officially been promoted yet, but I&apos;m calling this my promotion from here on out.
		I have the authorisation in the system to perform manager tasks.
		I have the training to be a shift leader.
		I have the manager uniform.
		I have the alarm code.
		I have the key to the front door, which I verified by testing today does work on the back door too.
		I have the key to the cash registers.
		And I have the key to the managers&apos; cabinet.
		The only thing I&apos;m missing is the raise that comes with being a shift leader, and I don&apos;t really care about that for now.
		I&apos;m not that bad off, financially, that a single quarter dollar per hour is going to make or break me.
		I&apos;ll want that raise for when I fill out job applications that ask for my ending pay rate, but I&apos;m stuck here for the foreseeable future.
		As long as I get that raise before I go, I really don&apos;t care when it actually happens.
		If it happens a week before I leave, that&apos;s good enough for me.
