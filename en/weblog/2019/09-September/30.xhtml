		It took more snow than I&apos;d like it to have, but I set up a base of operations to work from.
		Using snow for the roof, even though I&apos;m trying to gather snow for the island, will be better in the long run though.
		I&apos;m going to be using snow for all the roofs on the island, so using it for the hut on the water will help it fit better with the aesthetic of the area.

		At work, I was imagining how I&apos;d go about doing a Minetest stream or &quot;let&apos;s play&quot; video.
		I&apos;d like to do that some day, just not until I&apos;ve fixed my voice.
		One thing led to another, and I got to thinking about apples.
		Then something hit me: the stupid leaf decay mechanic that I just patched out of the subgame could be used on apples.
		If apples are not given the flag of having been placed by a player, they leave behind an invisible marker when taken.
		And that marker turns into another apple.
		Someone thought it would be a great idea to make apple trees continuously grow apples, and this is how they did it.
		This apple respawn mechanic makes it so you don&apos;t have to chop down your orchard and replant to keep getting apples.
		I can&apos;t even imagine the severe apple shortage we&apos;d have in the real world if apple trees could only grow apples once in their lifetimes.
		It takes so long to grow a mature tree!
		Mostly, I don&apos;t care in-game though, because I care more about upping my apple sapling stat than I care about the apples.
		I don&apos;t eat in Minetest, and there&apos;s not much you can do with apples, so most of them end up in storage or used as furnace fuel.
		Overall though, I think it&apos;s a cool idea.
		I think it separates us a bit from the game we get compared to so often, which itself is worth something.
		And I don&apos;t have to use every mechanic in the game; other players might have more fun with apple trees that keep providing food.
		But anyway, apples when placed by a player don&apos;t leave that marker, so you can&apos;t create a table that keeps spawning apples, for example.
		Or you could, but you&apos;d have a bigger challenge in doing so.
		You&apos;d have to plant the tree in just the right place, probably in a hole you dug to get the height right.
		And the tree height is random (within a range), so you might have to try a few times.
		Then you&apos;ve got to make sure the marker doesn&apos;t die off when you remove the tree.
		I didn&apos;t check the code today, but I think I remember it just requires a nearby apple log, which you could put anywhere within a certain range, such as using it as the base of the table, or even just using one stump as the table itself.
		If this bogus mechanic was left in though, you could build a wall of logs, then cover it in apples that, when picked, respawn.
		You&apos;d totally cheese the system with that.
