<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 64 grams of cereal and 99 grams of soy milk.
		I had 162 grams of muffuletta for lunch and 234 grams of it for dinner.
		I also ate 357 grams of snack mix.
		I&apos;m not sure why I ate that much snack mix.
		I wasn&apos;t exactly hungry, nor was I enjoying it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I picked up some snack mix instead of my usual pretzels today.
		Bad idea.
		The snack mix is nowhere near as good as I remember.
		I&apos;d definitely rather have the pretzels.
		I&apos;m glad I only bought one bag of this stuff.
		Unfortunately though, I buy in bulk, so it&apos;s a rather large bag.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="mobile">
	<h2>Mobile issues</h2>
	<p>
		For some reason, my mobile wasn&apos;t encrypting after I downgraded it.
		I finally got it to encrypt by performing a factory reset from within Replicant, which is particularly stupid, because I factory reset from within recovery mode at least three times, but that wasn&apos;t good enough.
		I played music on <a href="/en/domains/taylor.local.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a> while the mobile went through the storage-encryption process.
		For some reason, <code>taylor</code> suddenly partly crashed on me, and killed my session, sending me back to the display manager.
		That was odd, and lost me the windows I had opwn for working on my journal entry and researching the problems of my mobile.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the storage was encrypted, I inserted the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card and set about trying to get the music back onto the card.
		The device is no longer detecting the card though!
		This time, it&apos;s not a card format issue either, as the card isn&apos;t detected even when formatted as exFAT.
		Besides, even when the device doesn&apos;t like the card&apos;s format, it still visibly detects the card and just complains that it&apos;s either corrupted or malformatted.
		The device isn&apos;t doing that any more even.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s related or not, but I think Replicant 6.0 messed with the partition layout of the device too, so now that I&apos;ve downgraded to Replicant 4.2, the internal partitions aren&apos;t right.
		There are two user data partitions detected, the second of which is given the designation <code>sdcard1</code>, which is normally reserved for the actual <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.
		That makes me think that this extra partition may be interfering with the Replicant&apos;s assumptions about mounting the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.
		However, this second partition, which contains most of the otherwise usable space, isn&apos;t actually usable.
		It&apos;s behaving similar to the way the <abbr title="third extended filesystem">ext3</abbr> <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card was on Replicant 6.0, though this partition is detected still whether the <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card is physically in the device or not, so it&apos;s not the actual <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card.
		I&apos;m at a loss as to how I&apos;m supposed to fix this device.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was planning to get mobile service today, but if I still don&apos;t have a working mobile, that&apos;s not going to happen until I get the thing actually fixed.
		I usually take my photograph for the day while I&apos;m out if I have errands that day, but when I went to do that today, I found I didn&apos;t have my camera application.
		I&apos;d installed it after I thought I had the system working yesterday, but erased it when I did the factory reset today.
		As such, I ended up taking another one of those on-my-way-to-work photographs that have gotten rather boring by now, as I&apos;d had time to stop at home and get the camera reinstalled.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="errands">
	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		I got the bottles returned, though I somehow missed one of them.
		I didn&apos;t want to stand in the long line again for a single bottle though, so I&apos;ll just return that one next time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I picked up hex key set and socket wrench socket set.
		One of the hex keys is definitely the size I need for the bike; I checked it before I rode away.
		I might need to go back for more sockets though.
		I picked up the metric set; metric is the global standard, and it&apos;s what I prefer to use.
		However, I&apos;m pretty sure the bikes I&apos;ve got use the screwy United States Customary system, so to actually get any work done on the bikes, I&apos;ll need sockets based on that same screwy system.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="pay">
	<h2>Pay cheque</h2>
	<p>
		Also while I was out on my errands, I deposited my pay cheque at the credit union.
		When I opened up the envelope, I was taken aback.
		This was the largest pay cheque I&apos;d ever had!
		I don&apos;t yet have the promotion, so I don&apos;t yet have the minuscule raise in pay that comes with it.
		I&apos;d heard one of the shift leaders say in the past that the raise isn&apos;t really worth it, but the guaranteed hours are nice.
		I&apos;ve been stuck with more hours than before lately as I prepare to help run this place.
		I had no idea how much difference the higher number of hours would make.
		Schooling is going to be more difficult, with the fewer hours I&apos;ll have at home, but building my savings will be a bit easier.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="keys">
	<h2>Keys</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager gave me two of the three management keys today.
		The third, they didn&apos;t because the previous assistant manager neglected to return that key.
		First, I now have the key to the front door.
		I assume that same key works on the back door, but I&apos;ve yet to try it out on any door.
		Second, I have the key to the cash registers.
		I could already get into all the cash registers using the electronic, Windows-based interface.
		With the key though, I can get in without leaving a trace.
		Keys are very symbolic to me.
		They&apos;re a physical representation of knowledge.
		Without their secret shape (or lock-picking skills, which would be other knowledge to have), you can&apos;t open a lock without breaking it.
		To hand me these keys is to put a lot of trust in me.
		Trust I&apos;m not sure I deserve, but trust I will not abuse.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a side note, the key I&apos;m missing is the key to the cabinet.
		The cabinet stays unlocked all day, so it&apos;s really only at opening that you need the key to get in, and at closing that you need the key to lock it up for the night.
		Really, the key to the front door is the big one.
		Now that I think on it though, I think I was told at one point that all the managers have a different alarm code.
		That means I wouldn&apos;t be able to secretly get into the building; I&apos;d either trip the alarm or leave record of my presence.
		And of course if someone took money from the register or the cabinet, someone would notice it&apos;d happened next time the money was counted, which is at least twice daily, so I mean the keys show a trust in me, but it&apos;s not as much trust as it appears on the surface.
		Maybe I am actually worthy of this lesser level of trust.
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager also showed me something today that only the management, including shift leaders, is supposed to know about.
		I shouldn&apos;t write about the details here, as it&apos;s supposed to be a secret, but it&apos;s not some big thing that needs to be exposed, so I&apos;m comfortable not getting into what exactly it was.
		I only bring it up though to record my thoughts on the matter.
		I found it a bit amusing, as the head manager made a big deal about how only managers should know, but then showed me something I&apos;d already learned about at least a year ago.
		One of the other managers had shown me, though said I shouldn&apos;t touch it or tell anyone about it.
		It was good the head manager reminded me of its presence though.
		it can be useful at times, but I&apos;d only thought of it from the perspective of a lowly grunt.
		As a lowly grunt, it had nothing to do with me, so when I&apos;d see it every once in a while and remember what it was, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever actually think to make use of it.
		Now, even without any further information about it (or at least not any further <strong>*useful*</strong> information about it), it&apos;s something I can use as needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I have keys now.
		I think this means I got the job?
		I still haven&apos;t heard form the person-in-charge, but I probably won&apos;t.
		They don&apos;t really get back to you unless you pester them continuously, and I don&apos;t really care.
		If they&apos;ve approved me, they&apos;ve likely told the head manager, and I could actually ask the head manager if I cared.
		But to do that would be to make a big deal out of this, which is exactly what I&apos;m trying not to do.
		Speaking of the person-in-charge, I&apos;ve been told by other shift leaders in the past that new shift leaders have to continually pester them to get the raise given to shift leaders.
		I&apos;m not going to bother though.
		I really don&apos;t care.
		This isn&apos;t about the money for me.
		It&apos;s about the experience, and it&apos;s about improving my résumé.
		I will be a person with a history of being able to be trusted and being able to lead people.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/07.png" alt="Gathering sand underwater" class="framed-centred-image" width="809" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I was kind of struggling with the sand-based nodes, as far as coming up with ideas for them.
		The problem was that I was trying to create useful nodes while at the same time, trying to keep things in the spirit of the sand element, which is a spirit of senseless destruction.
		Honestly, I think the most-fitting idea for the glass-lock chest would be that it either destroys everything you put in it right away, destroys some of the stuff randomly at random intervals, or acts like a normal chest but without the safeguard that it won&apos;t let you remove the chest unless it&apos;s empty.
		So if you pick up the chest when it&apos;s not empty, all the stuff that it once contained just sort of gets deleted.
		None of these are positive traits.
		Once I started thinking more about the spirit of sand and less about usefulness, I also thought about making the sand torch into something that when placed on a wall (or ceiling or floor), it doesn&apos;t attach to the wall, but instead replaces the wall you put it on.
		Again, completely useless.
		No.
		It&apos;s actually <strong>*worse*</strong> than useless.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end though, that might be a good thing.
		To make sand items useful is to encourage players not to use the sand to raise their sand stat.
		And that&apos;s counterproductive.
		Maybe it should be the case that the sand items are set up such that strategic players will only  take sand out of things, never put it into them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another option might be to have players imbue elements with the lost sand though, instead of sand they still have.
		This would mean that players have to increase their sand stat to create sand-based items.
		The flip side to that though is that some items physically have sand in them, and that sand needs to be drawn out.
		And when recreating those items, actual sand needs to go back into them to avoid creating unlimited sand.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also toyed with the idea of sand opening some sort of rift into hammer space or something, which is where all the lost sand might go.
		That way, the chests would be useful, as they&apos;d allow you to stash things in one node but pull them out from another, more-distant one.
		The problem there though is data storage.
		I&apos;d then need to store things outside the map, and while I could do that, I&apos;d rather not from this mod.
		I&apos;d rather this modpack keep things pretty simple.
		I also thought about having nodes with sand in them only drop the sand when dug, not the rest of what they&apos;re made form, but that creates more stats to be counted, which is really, <strong>*really*</strong> against what this modpack is about.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end, I thought I came up with an idea for every combination I need for the initial release.
		I forgot about the bucket items though, so hopefully I&apos;ll figure those out tomorrow.
		I also decided not to include sand-element items, aside from the pedestal.
		I&apos;ve decided that as a creative exercise, I should write up the code for all sand-based items, but that I should also comment them all out because they&apos;re terrible, and take away far more from the game than they add to it.
		Sand is the <strong>*worst*</strong> element.
		I&apos;ll kind of dilute that by making sand into the element so terrible it can only drain items; never fill them up with its elemental power, instead of the element so terrible that it causes senseless destruction for unsuspecting players.
		But I still want to write the code for the worse option, just to prove to myself that I&apos;m not just doing this to practically remove an element from the list of what I need to plan for, and trying to take a shortcut.
		My only shortcut here will be that I won&apos;t be creating textures for these commented-out nodes, but that&apos;s the easy part.
	</p>
	<p>
		I decided to restructure the modpack.
		Instead of grouping things based on which element they&apos;ve been drained of (for drained items) or what element they&apos;ve been imbued with (for re-element-ed items).
		The pedestals will be included in their respective mods, so if you choose not to include a certain element, all of it&apos;s stuff can be just left out of your game.
		Some stuff will be in a small base mod that all the other mods in the modpack depend on though.
		This base mod will likely contain the basic logic used for crafting the pedestals, aside from the sand pedestal, and the other mods can then hook into that and register their respective pedestals.
		It&apos;ll also contain at least one item: char.
		There are several elements that can be cooked.
		What is cooked iron if you remove the iron?
		It&apos;s just cooked.
		You have an adjective without a noun.
		The same applies to cooked sand, or cooked gold.
		Sand and all the metals, at the very least, can be cooked in such a way, and when you take away the respective elements, it makes sense they should leave behind the same thing.
		That thing will be represented by the char item.
		And because this same item is a drained form made available by so many elements, it doesn&apos;t make sense to classify it as belonging o any one element&apos;s mod, so it seems like a better idea to put it in the code mod.
		Also of note, there are alternate forms of char that will be provided by the individual mods.
		Off the top of my head, buckets would be brained into some sort of triple char, steel blocks would be drained into some sort of nonuple char (which will be an item in the steel mod at first, but that&apos;ll get moved to the base mod once a support for a second metal is added), and bread will drain into some sort of char that takes four of an element, but is still a singular char.
