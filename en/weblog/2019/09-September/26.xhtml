	<h2>Sick</h2>
	<p>
		I thought my sore throat was from the vinegar, but it seems not.
		I&apos;m just sick.
		Today, I additionally had a plugged-up nose and just generally didn&apos;t feel all that well.
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up skipping the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting today to avoid passing on the illness.
		I did head out to get my pay cheque deposited and my rent cheque withdrawn though.
		Partly, I felt I needed to get it done as I was supposed to do it on Tuesday but forgot.
		Mostly though, I thought I needed to get a bit of exercise today.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/26.png" alt="The beginnings of the main bridge" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I thought that since I wasn&apos;t feeling well, I&apos;d spend most of the day catching up on Minetest.
		Instead, I spent most of the day resting in bed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did get a little work in Minetest done though.
		Mainly, I began work on the main bride.
		I needed a platform I could call home base during construction and leave my chests at, so I just put a bridge segment out in the water.
		It was too difficult to reach though, so I built a second segment that intersected the land.
		After that though, I started trying to clear logs out of my inventory so I wouldn&apos;t have to build as many chests, so I built the bridge out quite a bit further than will even be useful for the time being.
		Other than that, I just did some tree-farming to get the snow I needed for under and around the bridge, as well as have my laptop auto-grind needles into saplings for me while I rested.
	</p>
	<p>
		I actually came up with a new auto-grinding trick.
		My last trick is still the best I have for grinding multiple stacks of material while you&apos;re away, but in this new world (and the last one), I&apos;ve been avoiding stacking nodes more than one inventory-stack high to avoid generating parts of the map up in the sky that&apos;ll never be used again.
		I figured I&apos;d put of sky generation until I knew exactly where my grinding tower would be, then generate only the necessary sky area needed to make that happen.
		If I&apos;m only grinding one stack at a time though, I don&apos;t even need to put all the nodes onto the map at once.
		I can stand on undigable ground, bind both mouse buttons down, and the game simply won&apos;t place down the next node until the previous one has been finished off.
		It&apos;ll just keep placing the same node, then with the character&apos;s head covered, refuse to place the next node.
		That&apos;s saving even more blocks from being generated.
		Honestly, I thought it was a bad idea to generate even those few blocks up in the sky, but I didn&apos;t see another choice, as I needed to get the grinding done so I could get the elemental crystal and have mass storage for the saplings.
		Also, so I&apos;d have the saplings that could be put in mass storage instead of pine needles, which can&apos;t.
