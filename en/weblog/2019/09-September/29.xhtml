	<h2>Trying to buy a gaff</h2>
	<p>
		I found most stores online selling Gaffs were hitting me with those obnoxious <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> walls.
		I don&apos;t support sites that do that, so those options were out.
		Two sites seemed to let me through though, and I tried to buy a gaff from one of them.
		I figured getting just one would be safest, and after trying it out, I could get more if the gaff seemed to work well.
		I picked a site, and tried to place an order.
		However, their only available payment method was to use PayPal.
		That couldn&apos;t end well.
		Reluctantly, I tried placing the order anyway.
		PayPal threw a tantrum, and told the store site it couldn&apos;t process my order, so the store site said it couldn&apos;t process my order for &quot;technical reasons&quot;, without further explanation, and told me I should try another payment method.
		But they don&apos;t accept any other payment methods.
		I&apos;ve emailed them about the problem, so we&apos;ll see if they respond.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten two charge alerts about PayPal charging my card though.
		First, the usual one-dollar charge a lot of places issue for whatever reason, and later reverse.
		Then, the actual charge for the price I tried to pay.
		So I&apos;m not sure PayPal actually is refusing to transfer the money here, and not just copping an attitude in some way the store site didn&apos;t anticipate.
		I&apos;m eager to hear what the store site has to say about the problem, and if they don&apos;t respond, I need to remember to check my credit card account to make sure the second charge was likewise reversed.
		If not, I need to write to the credit card company, which is very good about responding to my messages.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s also worth noting I looked into the other store later, but they&apos;re sold out of my size.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I&apos;d previously thought about doing, I sewed one of the jockstraps into a better makeshift gaff.
		I didn&apos;t bypass the extra straps entirely, instead leaving a little bit of space on them still used, and didn&apos;t finish off my seam.
		I never intended to cut the straps off entirely, and with this unfinished seam, I count try the thing out and see if it needed to be adjusted before finalising the deed.
		I found the thing seemed to be way too small, which was odd, as I&apos;d tried this configuration without stitching it before.
		I&apos;ve been putting on the jockstrap, then getting it into this position and hoping it stayed in place for any length of time.
		I found I was doing it wrong though, and got this setup to work much better, with the stitch in its initial place.
		It sure is tight though.
		It&apos;s uncomfortable, the the sort of uncomfortable you mostly don&apos;t notice when you&apos;re distracted by other things that are going on around you and other things you need to be doing.
		I think this&apos;ll work just fine for the time being.
		Most of all though, it makes me feel a bit more feminine, even if no one notices, and even if nearly everyone is still convinced I&apos;m a man.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m still sick, though.
		I thought I ws getting better, but at work, I had sudden diarrhoea.
		I had to wash my panties in the restroom sink and hope no one noticed a lingering scent on my person (I&apos;m still too stuffed up to know if such a scent was noticeable through my pants), which was a bit embarrassing, but also left me dealing with, in addition to the discomfort of the makeshift gaff, the discomfort of being wet.
		Lovely.
		Still, it wasn&apos;t as bad as I&apos;d feared it would be, and further confirmed that this should work out for the time being.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/29.png" alt="The incomplete tree farm, seen from the incomplete bridge" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve got space for nine trees in my actual tree farm now, so I&apos;ve taken down my makeshift tree farm.
		I&apos;ve also managed to get a second pine sapling crystal, which tells me that if I didn&apos;t have a pine crystal, my storage problem would be out of hand now, with over two chests full of just pine saplings, still with no permanent place to put my chests.
		Once I have a storage room though, or the Elemental Tower, I&apos;ll be able to place down my second pine sapling crystal and move saplings, a load at a time, between the two.
		I&apos;ll be easier than the other option, which would be to empty the pine crystal into freshly-crafted chests, then move the pine crystal, and empty the chests back into the crystal.
	</p>
	<p>
		With a somewhat decent pine farm going, I considered working toward my mine location so I could start digging.
		By now, I&apos;ve decided to put my mine actually <strong>*inside*</strong> the island&apos;s mountain, which I sort of think looks like a castle.
		The bridge&apos;s path needs to pas right through the edge of that mountain, where I&apos;ll need to build a tunnel like last time, and a branch in the tunnel can lead down into the mine.
		I&apos;ve been thinking about it for a while now, but now that I actually consider doing it, I realise that I still don&apos;t have a place to put my chests, so gathering more resources underground that I&apos;ll have to store probably isn&apos;t the best idea.
		At the same time though, the sooner I start the mine, the sooner I&apos;ll have cobblestone with which to build an axe with.
		It&apos;d speed up my tree-harvesting.
		It&apos;ll speed up the landscaping of the island.
		It might actually be a good idea, even if it does mean even more makeshift storage for the time being.
		For now though, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going focus on getting to the mine site just yet.
		Building that tunnel&apos;s going to require a furnace to melt my cobble into stone for stone blocks and stone bricks.
		I want to get a small working shack set up first with the furnace in it, and probably move my chest there.
		The crystal can stay on the unfinished bridge for now.
		Given what I have to work with at the moment - a lack of prepared land - my working shack will probably need to be out over the water, likely supported with logs columns set into the ocean floor.
		I&apos;m not sure where to put that though, or what to have it look like.
	</p>
	<p>
		Come to think of it, the working shack should have been one of the first things I built.
		I shouldn&apos;t have set up the bridge as a makeshift base of operations, but instead, just built a base of operations.
		I don&apos;t like working with temporary infrastructure; by nature, you have to take it down, removing the history it represents in your game world.
		At this point, I have no choice: the base I set up at the bridge, as tiny as it is, is going to have to come down.
		It&apos;s exactly in the way of one of the main roads, and building the road elsewhere just wouldn&apos;t be the same.
		My first order of business, aside from continuing to gather the materials I need to shape the island, should be to build the small shack I should have built to begin with.
		I think I&apos;ll put it out in the water as I said, but I think I&apos;ll put a small deck around it.
		The shack itself will probably be simpler than my cabin from the previous world I spent so much time in.
		I&apos;m thinking about not building the Elemental Tower though.
		Perhaps the elemental crystals I place shouldn&apos;t be gathered in a single, mystical-looking place, but instead spread out a bit to where they&apos;d be most useful to have.
		The pine crystal, for example, would be great to have in the pine farm where I get all my saplings and where I use my saplings.
		There&apos;s no need to haul the excess to some other location for permanent storage.

	<h2Lost machine part</h2>
	<p>
		Some of the machines at work need to be dismantled and cleaned after we&apos;re done with them for the day.
		One of these machines is the huge dough mixer in the back room.
		Somehow, one of the components of the machine ended up in the dumpster.
		The head manager and the employee that&apos;d been using the machine tried to get it out, but they never could find it.
		By the end of the night, the machine-user had gone home (they were a part of morning crew, not evening crew), and the head manager had given up.
		We ended up borrowing a similar part from one of the other stores in the franchise.
		The thing is though, they need that part too to get their dough made.
		We couldn&apos;t have it at our store in the morning tomorrow to make the dough for the next day, so the head manager and one of the other employees made the dough tonight, so the part could be returned to the other store for their use tomorrow morning.
	</p>
	<p>
		How did the machine part end up in the dumpster to begin with though?
		I asked the head manager, but they were really frustrated about the situation and didn&apos;t even want to talk about it.
		To make matters more frustrating, the lock on the back door also jammed today, so no one was able to go out or come in through that door, instead having to head out the front door and walk all the way around the building.
		Obviously, it&apos;s not a difficult walk, but it takes time, and that&apos;s man hours the head manager&apos;s no doubt thinking about the cost of.
		Either that, or they&apos;re thinking about work that&apos;s not getting done with that time.
		It&apos;s added stress in either case.
