		For breakfast, I had 129 grams of muffuletta.
		For lunch, I had 116 grams of the same.
		For dinner, I had 631 grams of Aztec salad.
		I also snacked on 450 grams of pretzels though.
		Maybe if I&apos;d had more for lunch and dinner, I wouldn&apos;t have done that.

		I got the basic interface set up for players to deposit into and withdraw from the elemental crystals.
		I would have gotten more than that done, but it took me so long to decide how I wanted to set up the interface.
		In the end, I went with the obvious and intuitive-for-players solution.
		This is sort of what I&apos;d pictured in my mind, I guess.
		However, as you can see, there are two inventory slots.
		The entire way that these crystals are able to compress so well is that they don&apos;t actually have any inventories to store, and instead store a single integer representing the item count.
		But without an inventory, there can be no inventory slots, and an obtuse interface has to be built.
		That, or I&apos;ve got to set up some wacky hacks involving disembodied (technically referred to as &quot;detatched&quot; in the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>) inventories and jump through extra hoops to keep track of what those inventories are currently associated with.
		It wouldn&apos;t actually be that hard, but I worry about the reliability of the mod if I do it that way.
		I ended up adding two inventory slots, one of which perpetually stays empty, and one that holds redundant data.
		Both of them are a waste of data-storage space, but I anticipate that they&apos;ll keep use of the mod pretty smooth for users.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t get the back end for this done though, only the visual interface.
		I&apos;ll need to get the back end done later before I can get this mod doing anything useful.
		I have a short shift tomorrow though, so I might be able to finish.
		I mean, not finish the mod, but finish the back end and for this one feature and complete the deposit/withdrawal system.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve also decided that I want a &quot;remnant&quot; system in place before I release this mod.
		It won&apos;t do anything on its own, but will allow other mods to register drained versions of items, so I can put the drained versions in an optional second mod.
		Then optional mods beyond that can use the remnants to create the re-element-ed versions of items.
		That way, I can keep this mod simple, while still eventually implementing the fun nodes I want to.
		The remnant system has to be in place before release though so players won&apos;t need to upgrade when installing the remnant-adding mod.
		That way, it becomes exceedingly obvious to anyone reading the code that this was always an intended feature.
		It&apos;s not something that got tacked on later.
		It&apos;s just something that belongs in a separate mod and just something I actually planned out the specifics for later.
