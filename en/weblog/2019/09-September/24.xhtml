	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		It&apos;s been over a week, probably close to two weeks now, since I last returned redeemable bottles.
		I&apos;ve just been so busy.
		I finally got those returned though.
		I also got the drawing number checked.
		I won, but I won a milk-laden candy I can&apos;t even eat.
		Usually, when I win, I don&apos;t win anything actually usable.
	</p>
	<p>
		I should have deposited my pay cheque, but I forgot to bring it along.
	</p>
	<p>
		And finally, I tried to buy a third sandwich box at the grocery store.
		Last time my workmate was teaching me how to swim, I brought a sandwich for each of us.
		But if their partner&apos;s coming too, I should bring a third sandwich this time.
		The grocery store was out of them though.
		I&apos;m probably going to need to squish my own sandwich into a lidded bowel or something.

	<p>
		I finished copying the colour numbers from the palette image to the Lua file.
		I actually got most of it done last night though: a quarter before work, and a quarter on each of my breaks at work.
		So today, I had a quarter left to do, then I wrote up the notification messages the crystals send players.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was doing other things, I also had my laptop sit and mine leaves for saplings for me.
		I&apos;m hoping to clear out my pie needle box by getting a pine sapling crystal, converting all my needles, and shoving them into the crystal.
		I think I&apos;m going to start panning a house, too.
		Mainly, I&apos;m just farming snow right now, and I can&apos;t do much else until I finish.
		I&apos;m getting a bit of wood in the process though.
		I&apos;ll finish building the bridge out to near World&apos;s Navel, then probably start on floor plans laid out in pine needles on the ground.

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		It feels like the home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatments always take forever.
		Today was Tuesday though, so I set aside the time to get that done, while I ran Minetest on the laptop and had it grind pine needles for me.

<section id="tucking">
	<h2>Tucking</h2>
	<p>
		Okay, so I think I&apos;ve found the main issue with how I was tucking before.
		Today when I went out, I wasn&apos;t getting the same sort of chafing down the middle like I was last week, but I was getting chafing on the sides.
		I sort of half thought it might be unrelated, but I wasn&apos;t even sure.
		However, when I went to work, after having adjusted my underwear to protect my skin from the jockstrap, I found I didn&apos;t have a problem with being tucked all night.
		And you know how I wore the jockstrap when I went swimming?
		I wore it directly on my skin, under the swimsuit, with no underwear.
		I think the jockstrap is rubbing my skin raw.
		All I have to do is make sure the jockstrap is completely separated from my skin, and I should be alright.
		So when I go swimming tomorrow, I&apos;ll need to put on underwear, then the jockstrap, then the swimsuit.
		Wearing underwear in the pool will be a bit odd, but it should work better than last time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note, I didn&apos;t have any of the testicular squeezing issues that I&apos;d had before.
		That&apos;s completely unrelated to the jockstrap, but maybe I got the tucking done better this time.
	</p>

<section id="work">
	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Today, I closed the store with another shift leader, instead of the other newbie like myself.
		They ran the input side of the oven, while I ran the output side.
		They kept not listening as I&apos;d repeatedly call out things I needed them to throw in though.
		Loudly, even.
		I repeatedly had to go over to their side of the oven and throw things in myself - that is, I had to do their job for them - and the first time I had to do that was in the middle of a rush while I had to also make sure I got the pizzas out of the oven quickly enough for them not to burn.
		Needless to say, I was getting rather frustrated with them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another point of frustration was that they kept sending everyone on break over half an hour early.
		Normally, that wouldn&apos;t matter to me at all.
		I mean, I prefer taking my own breaks late rather than early, so I have less time after the break, but it&apos;s not something I&apos;d really worry about.
		However, the head manager has been hyping up today, and telling me I should work together with this other shift leader, communicate with them, and not make them do all the thinking.
		In particular, they told me not to have them be the one giving all the breaks.
		But if they&apos;re giving them over half an hour early without even talking to me, I never get a chance to talk to them about it <strong>*or*</strong> give any breaks myself.
		I&apos;m worried it&apos;ll make me look bad with the head manager.
		And mostly, everyone just did what they were supposed to.
		There was no planning, except when we planned who would work at what station, which we did actually discuss together.
		I gave a few instructions to people, which I&apos;m getting better at, but there wasn&apos;t much to communicate between one another besides the breaks, which they were doing without communicating with me, and the pizzas needed, which they weren&apos;t listening to me on.
		It felt like all day, we didn&apos;t really have much communication, and that led to a very frustrating day.
	</p>
	<p>
		At one point, they said to me &quot;Make it stop.&quot;.
		I thought to myself &quot;I should make it stop? You&apos;re the one causing the frustration here!&quot;, but I held my tongue.
		Instead, I asked them what they wanted stopped.
		It was the whistling, coming from the radio.
		I guess they didn&apos;t like the song that was playing.
		I jokingly said I&apos;d be more than happy to shut off the radio.
		They told me to do it.
		I verified that they weren&apos;t joking, then climbed up and hit the power switch.
		Having the radio turned off negated a lot of my frustration.
		We nearly always work with that radio on, and it never plays anything good.
		Having it off didn&apos;t change how terribly we were as a team, but it left me feeling less terrible about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have mixed feelings about this.
		On the one hand, I should try to figure out how to work better with this shift leader.
		It&apos;d be good practice.
		On the other hand, this shift leader&apos;s leaving us soon.
		I&apos;m not going to have to deal with them long.
		I haven&apos;t run into any major problems with the other shift leaders, but then again, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve worked with them on the level of a shift leader myself before.
		As a base-level employee though, I&apos;ve gotten along with all these people for years though.
		I assume we&apos;ll work decently together in the future.
	</p>

<section id="swimming">
	<h2>Swimming</h2>
	<p>
		My workmate decided to delay our meet tomorrow by two hours.
		Their reasoning was that we could miss the class-only hours in the main pool, and not get stuck in the lap pool when we got there.
		For me though, this means I can get more sleep.
		I closed the store tonight, so I got home late.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another workmate suggested I look for a sandwich box at the grocery store across the street from our workplace.
		I <strong>*really*</strong> don&apos;t like that store&apos;s attitude, so I didn&apos;t even consider checking it for sandwich boxes.
		Reluctantly, I took a look after work, but the only sandwich boxes they have are tiny.
		They won&apos;t even hold full-size slices of bread, so my sandwich would end up squished up anyway.
		If I&apos;m getting a squished sandwich either way, I might as well stick with the lidded bowel plan and not spend money on a container I&apos;ll only use once.
