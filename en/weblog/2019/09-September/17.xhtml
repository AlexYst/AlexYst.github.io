	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 119 grams of muffuletta.
		For lunch, I had 370 grams of Aztec salad.
		For dinner, I initially had 120 grams of muffuletta, but went back for a second helping of 131 grams.
		I also snacked on 115 grams of pretzels.

<section id="swimsuit">
	<h2>Swimsuit issues</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;d forgotten that my swimsuit&apos;s bottom doesn&apos;t have functional elastic until today, when I put it on to make sure I&apos;d shaved far enough up my legs.
		Drats.
		There&apos;s no time to get this fixed now.
		I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d need the suit for quite a while, so I didn&apos;t do anything about replacing the elastic.
		It was too far down on my priority list.
		I&apos;m not sure what to do about this with so little time left.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a last resort, I figured I have some swim trunks.
		I could pair the swimsuit top with the swim trunks and stay decent.
		The two don&apos;t match at all though.
		It&apos;d be an ugly combo.
		However, at least it&apos;d get the job done.
	</p>
	<p>
		I rushed to the department store to see if I could get a swimsuit on short notice.
		The problem is that I&apos;d never seen a swimsuit with a baggy bottom, aside from the expensive non-binary one I&apos;d seen online.
		Unfortunately, I have a crotch bulge.
		I can&apos;t wear something tight without making it stand out.
		I didn&apos;t think the store would have anything.
		And they didn&apos;t.
		It seems they sell swimsuit tops and bottoms separately so I&apos;d only need to replace the bottom, but they&apos;re all either bikini bottoms or almost bikini-shaped bottoms.
		However, I went searching further and found what I think are meant to be running shorts.
		They look a lot like swimsuit bottoms though.
		Pretty much no one will notice they&apos;re not unless they&apos;re <strong>*trying*</strong> to find fault with me.
		Which they might, considering that I&apos;ll be a male in a feminine swimsuit.
		But whatever.
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing I noticed though was how terrible the elastic is on these things,even though they&apos;re brand new.
		I think perhaps elastic on feminine garments isn&apos;t as stretchy as on masculine garments.
		It&apos;s been years since I used elastic at all, so I only have very old data points from when I lived with Summer to work with.
		Well, I guess I have one pair of shorts I use with fairly weak elastic, but even that pair has better elastic than these new ones.
		Anyway, my point is that perhaps the elastic on the pair given to me isn&apos;t actually trashed.
		Maybe that&apos;s just the way it&apos;s meant to be and it&apos;s just too big on me.
		Speaking of which, it seems I can fit into a medium or a large!
		I&apos;ve lost a lot of weight.
		The medium fits better overall, but shows my unfortunate bulge more.
		With a tight jock strap though, I thought I might be able to make it work.
		I bought the large one too though just in case the medium doesn&apos;t work out.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried using the jock strap to tuck, and it wasn&apos;t enough.
		So I looked up instructions on how to tuck in something as tight as a swimsuit.
		The instructions I found recommended duct tape.
		Ouch!
		But I tried everything the instructions said to do <strong>*except*</strong> using the tape, then used the jock strap to hold that in place.
		That worked a lot better than the way I&apos;d tried before.
		I need to remember that there&apos;s no substitute for shoving your testes up inside the tubes up above the scrotum.
		I wasn&apos;t sure it&apos;d hold though, so I tried wearing it through my whole work shift, which for today, was only four hours.
		It was a bit uncomfortable.
		I enjoyed the increased freedom of my legs, which weren&apos;t constantly bumping into my testes like they usually do, and I could comfortably stand with my legs firmly together.
		My genitals weren&apos;t used to it though, and there was a constant pressure on them.
		That would have been fine on its own, but sometimes when I&apos;d bend down, one of them would somehow get crushed, and that hurt.
		There was a spot on the skin that got rubbed raw too, so that&apos;s not fun.
		When I got home, I tried on the new swimsuit bottoms again.
		I&apos;d come a bit untucked by the time I got home, but still held well enough for my bulge not to be visible in either bottom.
		Perfect.
		This will work for tomorrow, as long as I&apos;m not there with my workmate for more than four hours.
		After that, I&apos;m not sure how much longer the tuck will hold.
		Once they leave for work though, I can find a secluded spot and readjust if need be.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe this should be my goal for this term.
		Maybe I should tuck every day, both to get used to it and so I can practice and get it right.
		At work, I wear baggy enough clothing that it doesn&apos;t matter.
		Off the clock, I wear tighter jeans, but they&apos;re still jeans, so they&apos;re think and hold my genitals at bay.
		Honestly, I don&apos;t need to tuck most of the time.
		It&apos;ll be nice to learn to do it right for when I do need to though.
		And once my voice has improved a bit, I&apos;d like to transition to wearing similar pants as what the women at work tend to wear.
		They tend to wear tighter pants made from a thinner fabric than would keep my stupid bulge at bay on its own.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/17.png" alt="The partly-cleared stone of my island" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I have no idea how to test the remnant system without remnant items to test with.
		So, before coding any of the remnant system, I&apos;m coming up with remnant counterparts for the 0.4.0 items.
		Something interesting occurred to me today when I was trying to name the remnant steel shovel.
		The axe and the pick are made from the same materials.
		They&apos;re just in a different configuration.
		I&apos;d planned to make remnant items identical if they left the same materials behind.
		However, this means that you can&apos;t have a, say, sapling based axe <strong>*and*</strong> a sapling-based pick.
		One remnant recipe would override the other.
		Perhaps more importantly, if you drain an item then refill it with the same element, it&apos;ll change form sometimes.
		That&apos;s no good.
		I&apos;d considered that issue from the context of the <code>vessels</code> mod.
		The cup and the bottle are each made with half a glass node.
		They&apos;re basically the same thing though, so I didn&apos;t dwell on the issue too long.
		If I&apos;m going to do this right though, I need separate remnant items in cases in which different items are drained of the same element.
		For example, the glass cup and glass bottle need separate remnant forms, but because the basic glass node and the steel ingot have to be drained of different elements, they can produce the same remnant: char.
		Glass and steel ingots can simply be considered alternate-element versions of one another that both happen to be craftable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to the interface, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll make it possible to set both elements in a multi-element craft to be the same thing.
		If you put a multi-element item with one element drained into an elemental crystal, what happens will be determined by the element.
		If the crystal is of the remaining element, it&apos;ll drain that element and leave both elemental slots empty.
		Otherwise, it&apos;ll fill the empty elemental slot.
		With items that have multiple empty elemental slots, the one with the highest need for an element (that is, the slot that had the most of an element to begin with) will be filled first.
	</p>
	<p>
		In-game, my current goal is to clear away all the sand.
		I&apos;ve made decent progress on that front.
		Next, I&apos;ll need to start a makeshift snow farm.
		I need to get enough snow to cover the area.
		I mean, it&apos;s called Snow Haven, right?
		It should have a lot of snow.
		Meanwhile, the snow farm will produce a lot of logs as a byproduct, and I can use those to start work on the bridge to World&apos;s Navel.
		Once the area is covered in snow and the beginnings of the bridge are in place, I&apos;ll start setting up the mine.
		Digging down into the stone, I&apos;ll finally have cobble for picks (I&apos;d really rather build only one wooden pick - the one needed to get the first cobble - and put off all other pick use until that point), and I&apos;ll be able to both grab all the coal I exposed when digging away the sand (which I marked with pine needles to easily find it again) and grind my sandstone away to get the sand crystal.
		I&apos;ll cook my silver sand into glass, then feed the glass to the sand crystal to get char and more beach sand.
		I might hold off smelting iron or I might not, but if I do hold off, I can use the char to smelt the iron, then use the iron to make bottles to make vessels shelves out of.
		And of course, I&apos;ll drain the shelves of their sand, effectively converting the iron into beach sand.
		That char will have a two places in the convert-stuff-to-beach-sand process.

	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I ended up having to get the full treatment at my appointment today instead of the planned touch-up.
		I let my beard and moustache grow out for a week so we could see where needed to be touched up, and my face has been a mess.
		It was kind of embarrassing to go to work, honestly.
		A lot of my hair has been bleached by the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>, so when I shave the darker hair, I don&apos;t even notice the lighter hair that comes off too.
		My next appointment will be on October first, at 10:00.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, once I got home from my appointment, it was time to do the home-treatment on my chest and belly.
	</p>

<section id="sir">
	<h2>&quot;Sir&quot;</h2>
	<p>
		I noticed today that the new recruit I was stationed with kept calling me by name, far more often than would be normal.
		Like, almost everything they said to me would end in my name.
		It was really odd, and I couldn&apos;t figure out why they were doing that.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a while, it dawned on me.
		They always call the head manager &quot;Sir&quot;.
		Yesterday, they asked me &quot;Are you my boss too, Sir?&quot;.
		I replied that I&apos;m not a &quot;Sir&quot;, but I am one of the bosses.
		For whatever reason, they&apos;re in the habit of calling their bosses &quot;Sir&quot;, and when I sort of asked them not to call me that, they replaced the word with my name.
		I guess that&apos;s better.
		A lot better, actually.
		They&apos;re not addressing everyone that way though, so it&apos;s odd that they&apos;re addressing me that way.
		And odd they&apos;re addressing the bosses that way, seeing how informal the place is.
		I&apos;m really not sure what to think of this.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="counterfeit">
	<h2>Counterfeit</h2>
	<p>
		A couple days ago, when that counterfeit hundred came in, I overheard the customer that tried to pawn it off on us tell the head manager they were going to take faux bill back to the deli they&apos;d gotten it from.
		One of my workmates mentioned wondering who&apos;d taken the fake hundred after seeing the new notices saying to watch for fake hundreds, so I told them the story and how no one had taken the bill.
		We weren&apos;t out any money this time.
		Normally, those signs go up right after the head manager finds a fake bill in the register, but that hadn&apos;t happened this time.
		As I told the story though, it occurred to me that customer&apos;s story didn&apos;t check out.
		I honestly hadn&apos;t given their story any thought.
		There was a fake bill, and it was my job not to allow it to mistakenly fall into our hands and us be out that money.
		with my job done, the part of the situation relevant to me had ended.
		But today, I thought about why they&apos;d get a hundred-dollar bill from a deli.
		Bills larger than a hundred have fallen out of circulation in my country.
		Some of them still exist, and they&apos;re technically legal tender still, but they&apos;re worth more as collectors&apos; items.
		You&apos;re not going to go spend one at the deli.
		And without paying in a larger bill then a hundred, you&apos;re not going to get a hundred-dollar bill back as part of your change.
		And that&apos;s not to mention that the deli isn&apos;t likely to have one on-hand at the moment you happened to come in with a huge bill, as even hundreds won&apos;t pass through the deli all that often.
		The story just doesn&apos;t add up.
		It didn&apos;t come from the deli.
		They either made it themself or they&apos;re in cahoots with the one that did.

<section id="Summer">
	<h2>Summer</h2>
	<p>
		I got home and saw someone up on my porch.
		Getting a better look, I realised it was Summer.
		What was she doing here?
		I saw her carrying some things down to her vehicle.
		Okay, sweet.
		She&apos;s started moving out.
		Maybe.
	</p>
	<p>
		The one thing I could make out for sure was her record player.
		One time, I mentioned to her finding it humorous that one of the local department stores had a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> record player in stock.
		I mean, what are the chances?
		Are they actually selling them often enough for it to be worth stocking them?
		Who even <strong>*uses*</strong> record players any more?
		If it&apos;d been a music store or some sort of speciality store, I would have somewhat understood, but this just seemed bizarre to me.
		The first thing out of her mouth was a question about if I wanted one.
		Um, no.
		If I thought one was worth having, I probably wouldn&apos;t have found the thing so humorous.
		And I told her that.
		Pretty soon though, I find that record player in my living room.
		I figured it was meant for me.
		I figured that once again, she hadn&apos;t listened to a thing I said.
		My entire life, she&apos;s been this way.
		She asks if you want something, and if you tell her &quot;no&quot;, she gets it for you anyway.
		Why even ask if you&apos;re not going to accept the answer?
		I ignored the thing though.
		If I was right and she intended it for me, it was best not to give it so much as an acknowledgement until she brought it up.
		And if I was wrong,it meant she was just storing it there for herself, and it was best I not throw falls accusations at her.
		Either way, ignoring the device was my best option.
		A bit later, Vanessa informed me it&apos;d been meant for me, and that while she knew I didn&apos;t want it, Summer somehow thought that I did.
		And a bit after that, Summer told me herself that it was for me.
	</p>
	<p>
		But anyway, Summer never actually wanted that record player, so perhaps she was just taking some stuff to get rid of, and isn&apos;t actually moving out after all.
		I can only hope.
	</p>
	<p>
		I pretended not to notice her, and by the time I drew near, she was downstairs at her vehicle.
		I stopped and talked to the neighbour for thirty seconds, so she probably heard me, but ignored me.
		I headed upstairs, found the door unlocked, and as I did so, she drove away.
		That means she knew very well I was around.
		Otherwise, she would have come back to lock the door.
		She either wants nothing to do with me or she understands I want nothing to do with her.
		Perhaps even both.
		I mean, she <strong>*was*</strong> already avoiding me even before we had our final talk.
		I was very mistaken to think I needed to write her another letter and tell her she&apos;s lost me in case she didn&apos;t realise an in case she wants to make amends.
		She does know and she doesn&apos;t want to patch things up.
		It&apos;s no closure, but it&apos;s probably as close as I&apos;m going to get for the time being.
		I&apos;ll get my closure once she moves out and I request the key back.
		Honestly, I think she&apos;d&apos;ve duplicated it by now, and might not even admit to that.
		However, by making her give back the copy she knows I know she has, it symbolically tells her she&apos;s not welcome here.
		It also means she can&apos;t claim ignorance and come in later with a duplicate.
		If she gets caught, she knows it&apos;d be breaking and entering.
		She&apos;s crazy and she loves crossing boundaries, but I don&apos;t think she&apos;s the type to cross that type of clearly-defined boundary were the law is not on her side.
