		For breakfast, I had 86 grams of cereal and 201 grams of soy milk.
		For dinner, I had 174 grams of muffuletta.
		I didn&apos;t really have lunch today.

		I finished the manager test today.
		It took a few hours, seeing as I had to hand-write all the questions and answers.
		The paper the questions were on didn&apos;t provide anywhere near the amount of space you&apos;d need to answer, as it wasn&apos;t meant for this sort of thing.
		It simply has a space for the question and a space to mark how many points were awarded based on how you verbally answer the question.
		It&apos;s the paper the test&apos;s administrator would mark on while verbally conducting the test.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, I just realised today that I&apos;ve been having to deal with this test, unpaid, on my own time.

		I worked out the equation for finding which node would take on each combination of elements for the 1-, 2-, and 3-element combinations with the exception of combinations involving sand, as I&apos;ll be handling that with separate rules to eliminate the possibility of 4-element combinations that include sand.
		This cuts the number of combinations that even include sand down to a minimum, which is preferable.
		Because sand is an element, it should be allowed to be mixed with the other elements, but each node has to be filled with the element it represents for it to function.
		Because of the terrible way in which the sand element works though, having large amounts of sand to put into something like this requires that you not use that sand to level up.
		So which should you use the sand for?
		I find that rather frustrating, personally.
		As for 4-element combinations, they will need to be manually assigned a node most likely because such combinations will likely need to be chosen manually.
		Having the three-element combinations automatically assigned a node that will represent them saves me a lot of hassle though.
		I don&apos;t have to try to evenly distribute these combinations so each element is the &quot;dominant&quot; one - the one that the textures take after - the same amount of the time.

		On the side, I came up with an odd idea I toyed with for dealing with gravel.
		Basically, I&apos;d replace all gravel nodes with flint ore nodes.
		I would never have to deal with my gravel falling into the lava when I was trying to mine it again.
		I wouldn&apos;t need to stack the gravel I&apos;d mined into a pillar and repeatedly mine it until it dropped flint, either.
		It&apos;d make things a lot easier.
		I decided against actually creating such a mod though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though the idea of element-mixing seemed pretty cool, I came up with an alternative I might use instead.
		First, scratch the mana idea.
		Instead, use actual materials to build the nodes.
		You have to fill up your main inventory and your crafting grid with full stacks of the material you want to build a node from.
		Then, when you go to craft the node, your entire inventory ends up cleared because the crafting process takes all of it.
		It takes that much material to craft these incredibly-dense nodes.
		This also discourages abandoning the nodes, as crafting them took so very much material, so I can probably remove the feature that you have to power these nodes by filling them with relevant material.
		As for the palette indexes, they would be basically used as compression levels.
		Gather enough of the index-zero nodes, which are crafted as described above, and you can combine them into an index-one node.
		I&apos;m not sure how many should be combined at each new level though.
		I&apos;d love to set it to a full inventory again, but that would make even getting to index-one nodes pretty much impossible.
		Forget getting index-two-fifty-five nodes at that point.
		Most of the indexes, perhaps even all but one, would be completely wasted.
		I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;d do as far as which colours to use for each index at that point either.
		Is yellow more or less compressed than pink?
		Or would I just have all the indexes be used for a gradient of the same colour?
		The clear advantage to this setup though is that I&apos;d have far fewer node abilities to come up with.
		Compressing the nodes further would just be to show off, not for further functionality.
		That said, these would pretty much be trophy nods at this point, similar to the old PB&amp;J Pups that got removed form the game a while back.
		What sort of functionalities should trophy nodes have?

		My insubordinate workmate got fired today.
		That really sucks.
		I mean, I totally get it, but while they were a bit of a pain at times, that doesn&apos;t mean I wanted them losing their job.
		I guess now I feel a bit bad about choosing not to work with them yesterday.
		That would have been the last time we worked together.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t consider it at first, but this also probably means I&apos;m not getting back the $1050 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> I lent them.
		Nearly a month&apos;s worth of pay, just gone.
		I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be seeing them again; they&apos;d have to go out of their way to repay me, and I just don&apos;t have that much faith in people, especially people that don&apos;t care enough to even stop misgendering me.
