	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		The school wrote back to me about my long letter from yesterday.
		While I admit that I was far too distraught to think of the letter as a test when I sent it, by the end of the day, I thought that it would double as a test. It contains absolutely nothing that would need to be handled.
		Would my academic advisor actually write back in a timely manner?
		They&apos;re always so slow, but maybe that&apos;s the bureaucracy and not them themself.
		They still stand up for the broken system&apos;s glaring flaws, so I&apos;m not saying they&apos;re by any means in the right, but maybe they&apos;re not as bad as I&apos;ve made them out to be.
		And furthermore, they could stand to stop keeping me in the dark, thinking that they haven&apos;t even read my letters because they haven&apos;t responded to them.
		A simple &quot;I&apos;m handing this over to <var>x</var> department, we&apos;ve got to wait for them to respond.&quot; would go a <strong>*long*</strong> way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, the response didn&apos;t come from the advisor themself, but from someone that from the sound of it is the advisor&apos;s boss.
		They opened with &quot;I trust this email finds you well.&quot;.
		What a joke.
		They claimed to have read my emails over the past unspecified amount of time, so they know very well that the email hasn&apos;t found me well.
		They also said they were glad that the issue with the cashier&apos;s cheque had been resolved.
		Again, that issue was never resolved either.
	</p>
	<p>
		They said they actually do have a telephone number, but that it goes straight to the answering machine.
		They say I can call them and leave a message with my student <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> number and my email address, and they&apos;ll email me to get back to me.
		They didn&apos;t read my letter with much comprehension for its meaning if they think that somehow helps anything.
		You may notice that I switched in my response below from saying the payment option was open in week six to saying it was open in week five; that&apos;s because this person said it was open in week five.
		I&apos;m not sure, honestly.
		What I know is that I pay as soon as they open the payment option, as they always send out an email notice at that time.
	</p>
	<p>
		They made claims about how I should pay earlier, but also how they can&apos;t open the payment option earlier.
		They said students should take prompt action in paying their tuition.
		What a laugh.
		I pay as soon as the option becomes available each term.
		It&apos;s not my promptness that&apos;s lacking.
		It&apos;s the school&apos;s payment window size and the school&apos;s patience.
		They&apos;re not taking into account that mail-delivery is slow.
		They claimed to give students as much time as they can to plan, but that&apos;s not the problem here.
		The problem is a lack of time to execute the plan.
	</p>
	<p>
		They then stood up for my advisor.
		Good for them.
		A boss <strong>*should*</strong> stick up for their employees.
		They said that my advisor only doesn&apos;t respond when waiting for other departments to get back to the advisor.
		Of course, as I mentioned above, they leave me in the dark the entire time, so it looks like they&apos;re simply not reading and dealing with my emails until way later than maybe they are.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, they claimed this to be a learning experience for me.
		Yes, I&apos;ve learned quite a bit, but none of that new knowledge excuses or makes up for missing an entire term.
		Anyway, my response was as follows:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>, 
		</p>
		<p>
			No, of course this email doesn&apos;t find me well.
			If you&apos;ve gone back and read my letters as you said you did, you know that this letter finds me to be quite angry, frustrated, and devastated.
			As for the issue with the cashier&apos;s cheque, the issue is that it has prevented me from getting into courses this term.
			So no, the issue was never resolved.
			Instead, the issue was only *understood*.
			During the past couple weeks, I&apos;ve managed to gather enough information about the situation to get a bird&apos;s eye view of what went down.
			Nothing more.
			Nothing actually got fixed here.
		</p>
		<p>
			The telephone number is interesting, but I think you misunderstood the situation there.
			I have no telephone service.
			I can&apos;t call you.
			And the credit union needed to speak with a live human, not an answering machine.
			I&apos;ll add that number to my notes though in case it becomes useful in some way in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the many points I made is that you *don&apos;t allow us* to send in payments early.
			And now you&apos;re telling me both that payments cannot be sent until week five *and* to send payments early.
			Which is it? I send payments as soon as the payment option opens.
			The mail just takes time to arrive.
			Can payments be sent early or not? If I can send in payments for a given term prior to the term even starting, we can *definitely* prevent this problem from occurring in the future.
			I can send you a lump sum for all the remaining courses I will need to take in the future right now, and you&apos;ll never have to wait for my payment in the mail again.
			According to my records, I have fifteen more courses to take.
			I can send you that $1500 USD right now, if that&apos;s alright with you.
			Just say the word.
		</p>
		<p>
			You say you give students as much time to plan financial and academic commitments as you can each term, but planning isn&apos;t the issue here.
			I had every one of my terms - all eight of them - planned up to the point I leave the school.
			The planning was entirely done, although it will need to be slightly redone now that your causing me to miss this term has derailed things a bit.
			That won&apos;t take too long though; mostly, I&apos;ve just got to move the dates around.
			The problem isn&apos;t not having time to plan, it&apos;s not having time to pay.
			You have such a small payment window and the time it takes for payments to make it through the mail eats up most of that.
			There&apos;s no wiggle room for dealing with technical problems and mistakes such as these that come up.
			When you open the payment option, I get the cheque sent to you as quickly as possible.
			However, within a week, you&apos;re already hounding me about how I haven&apos;t paid, even though my cheque is in the mail, because you&apos;re expecting to receive payment within a week of your initial request for payment.
			It takes a lot longer than a week for payment to get to you, and the fact that you start hounding us that quickly shows you should have opened the payment option several weeks sooner.
			You say I should take prompt action.
			I *DO* take prompt action.
			You simply are expecting the mail to go much quicker than it does, and not taking into account that even with the promptest of action, this isn&apos;t going to go as quickly as you expect it to.
			Given how long the mail takes, you&apos;re not giving us students as much time as you seem to think you are.
		</p>
		<p>
			If <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> is honestly trying this best and just not telling me he&apos;s sent things to whatever office, which leaves me in the dark and thinking he&apos;s just not responding, he&apos;s the *only* one at this school that seems to actually care then.
			If that&apos;s the case, then I&apos;m very sorry for lashing out.
			But even if this is the case, he&apos;s representing a school that clearly doesn&apos;t care.
			This isn&apos;t the first issue I&apos;ve had here.
			For example, I&apos;ve written multiple times about a bug in your JavaScript that *EATS MY COURSEWORK AS I TYPE IT*.
			Every time, I&apos;m told this will not be fixed.
			My only solution has been to disable JavaScript entirely, which breaks other parts of the website because the website is so poorly constructed that even basic page navigation, which should be in pure XHTML or HTML, has been moved to JavaScript.
			It even used to be the case that disabling JavaScript to keep my coursework from being lost didn&apos;t interfere with the navigation menus, but you people have actively made your website *less* accessible since then.
			You&apos;ve been working at *downgrading* the website.
			Another time, I wrote to the school about someone that had plagiarised my work.
			And what do you do about it? You start threatening *ME* about it.
			I&apos;m not even the one that cheated, but the one that unwillingly was cheated off of! Then I complied with your demands and informed you of such, and I never heard back about this issue.
			Not even so much as a statement that I was now in the clear.
			The stress from that made me *LITERALLY ILL*, and I spent a few days in bed with a killer headache.
		</p>
		<p>
			This school has a history of not caring.
			So far, three of my terms have gotten messed up.
			The first time, you messed up badly and I ended up in one course instead of two, and it wasn&apos;t even a course I needed.
			The second time, I ended up in two wrong courses due to slowness to respond, but at least I needed both courses.
			And now, you&apos;ve prevented me from taking courses at all.
			You could kind of say that the issue with the second term I mentioned was resolved, though not really.
			Another time, you half-fixed the email account assigned to me by the school.
			(As a side note, I&apos;ve been locked out of that account for some reason now, though I&apos;ve seen no reason to try to get that fixed because dealing with this school never seems to go well, so I&apos;ve just resorted to not using that email account.) Aside from those two half-fixed issues though, no issue I can remember writing to the school about has actually been resolved.
			I even tried to get my associate&apos;s degree, and somehow ended up with transcripts that I&apos;m not allowed to open instead.
			I still don&apos;t have my associate degree, even though I&apos;ve completed all the work for it.
			It&apos;s been one headache after another here, and if I wasn&apos;t so squid-damn poor, I would have transferred to another school over a year ago.
			That&apos;s the worst part about missing this term, too.
			It&apos;s the reason I&apos;m so very frustrated and so very angry: this means that I&apos;m stuck here for another three months! I came to this school with an enthusiasm for learning and you&apos;ve sucked that right out of me.
			Each day, my coursework is now my most-dreaded chore, and even thinking about it makes me lethargic.
			I just want to get this over with.
			I literally have a a countdown going on my computer that shows me how many days I have left stuck here.
			And now, you&apos;ve added three months to that.
			I just want to leave, but I&apos;m trapped by my poverty.
			And now I&apos;m trapped even longer.
		</p>
		<p>
			You&apos;re right, this has been a learning experience.
			I&apos;ve learned three main things.
			First, I&apos;ve learned to double-check my envelopes before I send them.
			I wouldn&apos;t want to to send an empty one again.
			Second, I&apos;ve learned that while my credit union does have protocols in place for lost cashier&apos;s cheques, in practice, they don&apos;t actually follow said protocols, and it leads to lots of confusion as well as delays in problem-resolution.
			And finally, I&apos;ve learned - or rather been reminded - that the school really doesn&apos;t seem to be on my side.
			And there&apos;s nothing I can do about that.

	<p>
		In preparation for starting a new world, I started messing with the map generator settings again.
		This time, I messed with the mountain elevation.
		From the sound of it, the setting was supposed to reposition the terrain vertically.
		In my mind, what this seemed to mean is that if I moved the mountains upward, it&apos;d basically give me more underground space and less sky.
		In my first few experiments, I wasn&apos;t noticing a reasonable difference, though some of the terrain I was familiar with seemed to have disappeared on me.
		It wasn&apos;t moved upward, it was just gone.
		World&apos;s Navel, in particular, had just become an empty spot in the ocean.
		I saw some terrain I wasn&apos;t familiar with, but it could have been places I just hadn&apos;t been before.
		And at one point, I ended up on Sleepless Isle, which seemed completely unchanged.
		I think at that point though, I&apos;d tried moving the terrain so far upward that Lua messed up the number in the settings menu, and C was reading it as just <code>1</code>.
		With the default being <code>0</code>, it would make sense I wouldn&apos;t notice a change.
		I set the mountain elevation to <code>20000</code> after that.
		That seemed like a reasonable level.
		It was small enough to be within range of the map bounds, and would give me about 10000 metres of sky space.
		That should work well for tests.
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing I&apos;d been curious about was whether the spawn location would be moved upward too.
		It was not.
		I spawned deep underground.
		Teleporting to where I thought the surface would be, I found the setting was working much closer to how I thought it would.
		There were a couple quirks though.
		First, there were minerals everywhere.
		I hadn&apos;t thought about how the mod-added minerals wouldn&apos;t be equally offset as the engine-generated mountains.
		And secondly, there was no water.
		I hadn&apos;t moved the water upward too, though I did know of the setting to do that.
		I didn&apos;t recognise where I was, so I moved the water upward and tried again.
		I figured what I was seeing was all the undersea caves and seafloor, all dried up.
		If I added the water back in, I should be able to tell where everything was.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was wrong though.
		Nothing in this new world was right.
		The terrain shape wasn&apos;t simply moved upward.
		This was entirely new terrain that I hadn&apos;t encountered before.
		At first, I thought it might be a fun new world to explore.
		I&apos;d later realise that this world was missing sand and coral though.
		Those were set to spawn deep underground now, except that coral isn&apos;t allowed to spawn underground, so it probably wasn&apos;t spawning at all.
		Sand may or may not be spawning, but if it was, it&apos;d take a huge amount of digging to reach.
		What I noticed before that realisation though was the forests.
		I live in a wintry area, where more pine forests can be found than you&apos;d ever go looking for.
		The trees were spawning underwater though.
		I mean, not all of them were.
		There were plenty on land too.
		But the land underwater was set to be pine forestland due to technically being of too high an elevation to be beach land.
		Tall tree trunks littered the watery depths, mostly without leaves due to the subgame having been written to overwrite non-air node with the trunks, but not with the needles.
		A few needle nodes were present down there, but not many.
		They&apos;d probably been loaded into the <code>ignore</code>s or something.
		It looked like a forest had been flooded though, and an ecosystem destroyed.
		There was an awe-inspiring but solemn feel to the place.
		It might be a fun place to visit, but it wouldn&apos;t be a good place to inhabit.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was out on the bike path, I thought more about what I would want from a mod.
		Most of what I came up with was a rehashing of old ideas I&apos;d already come up with.
		I think the results turned out pretty good though.
		Good for me, anyway.
		I don&apos;t think a mod such as this has much chance of ever being popular.
		Remember the trophy nodes form yesterday?
		Yeah, I want to make those drain the elements out of whatever item you tell them too, like some sort of element leaches.
		I also want them to act as storage vessels for an unlimited amount of their respective element.
		And finally, I want them to be able to put elements into objects that have been drained.
	</p>
	<p>
		Picture this.
		You have a locked chest.
		The only element in it is the iron, as the wood was never an element.
		It only spawned from a sapling element.
		What do you have left?
		If you said an unlocked chest, that&apos;s a good guess.
		But more went into that chest than the iron and the wood.
		You didn&apos;t craft raw iron into the chest, but cooked steel, and cooking takes material.
		So now you have a chest with some sort of void where the lock should be, but the void isn&apos;t completely empty.
		You&apos;ve got some sort of incomplete locked chest, ripe to put whatever element you choose into it.
		Why not put a sapling into it instead of the iron?
		You&apos;ll get some other type of chest instead of a locked one.
		And since you can&apos;t make sapling ingots (well, you <em>*could*</em> by using a similar method but using an iron ingot instead of a locked chest), and the concept of a &quot;sapling ingot&quot; doesn&apos;t even make much sense, the new chest is likely to be a bit strange in some way.
		Multi-element items such as powered rails are bound to have some interesting qualities to come up with as well when you swap out both elements.
		With wood no longer able to be swapped out with other things, unlike the <code>amalgam</code> mod, it should drastically reduce the number of things I have to make up, making this maybe more feasible.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m considering making the ability to drain objects and the ability to undrain objects be level-dependant, element-dependant, and item-dependent, but then again, maybe not.
		I might use the levelling mechanic to do something with the re-element-ed items too, but again, maybe not.
		It&apos;s really up to me as to what I determine is feasible.
		One of the things I absolutely love about this idea though is that I&apos;ll finally have a use for a bunch of previously-useless materials, such as flint and mushrooms.
		I&apos;m especially excited to think about what I might choose to do with mushrooms.
	</p>

<section id="path">
	<h2>The end of the bike path</h2>
	<p>
		For a few days, I&apos;ve been thinking that if I didn&apos;t manage to get into school this term, today would be the day I biked to the fourth end of the riverside bike paths.
		There are two paths, one on each side of the river, and they&apos;re connected in several places by bridges.
		Two non-looped paths means there are four path ends.
		I&apos;d been to three of them, but never had time to check out the fourth.
	</p>
	<p>
		I mostly got ready to go, but then decided I had other obligations I should take care of.
		A bit later though, I realised that I was so close to being ready already, and didn&apos;t want my preparations to go to waste.
		I&apos;d even packed up my laptop and my lunch so I could sit at the end of the path and work on my journal.
		I needed to relieve some stress and I needed to burn off some of this stupid fat.
		I&apos;d just blow off my other responsibilities for today.
		They could wait.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hadn&apos;t gone all that far into the forest before I&apos;d noticed that I was letting my eyes focus on the wrong part of the road, and that my subconscious was navigating using my peripheral vision.
		My conscious mind was only taking over to deal with less-stationary obstacles such as other cyclists.
		I just let that continue, and just thought about the mess I&apos;m in, and how I&apos;m barred from progressing in my studies for the next three months.
		Once I got pretty far out though, I started thinking about Minetest instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		Near the end, I came to a branch in the path, where both options almost seemed like the main path.
		One kept going along the river though, and the other headed perpendicularly away.
		I took the riverside fork, only to find that it too curved away pretty soon.
		Before I headed out today, I always assumed the path would lead to some residential area.
		Instead, it turned out to lead to an area of downtown Eugene that I wasn&apos;t familiar with.
		There though was a used computer store.
		There&apos;s a chain of second-hand stores that have some locations in my area, and one of them has a computer store attached to it.
		I knew about that store, but had no idea where it was.
		Now I do.
		Next time I need a computer, I&apos;ll probably try coming here.
	</p>
	<p>
		I nearly saved the other fork of the path for another day and another exploratory adventure, but decided that as I was already here, I&apos;d check it out.
		I didn&apos;t think the path would continue much further; not in <strong>*that*</strong> direction, anyway.
		It led to much more what I was expecting, though I think I wasn&apos;t technically allowed on the final segment of the path.
		It looked like the city-owned path stopped at a street, and someone built another path exactly across the street from it and labelled it as being for residents only.
		I took the path anyway, figuring I&apos;d say I missed the signs.
		I wasn&apos;t causing anyone any harm, and my goal for the day was to find the end of the path.
		I wanted to finish doing that.
		The area was pretty empty though, so no one saw me.
	</p>

<section id="feminine">
	<h2>Feminine</h2>
	<p>
		I was supposed to do laundry last night.
		I plan to do laundry the night of my last shift at work before my days off.
		I really wasn&apos;t feeling up to it though, so I put it off until tonight.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the neighbours caught me and asked how I was doing, so I explained how I was missing my term.
		They asked questions, and we ended up talking about the details of that.
		It turned out they were waiting for one of our other neighbours, as they were going on a trip somewhere, and the other neighbour came out.
		Before they left, they talked to me and said that at first, they didn&apos;t recognise me, and thought some crazy lady had caught the other neighbour and were talking their ear off.
		I guess I seemed crazy with how frustrated I am, but they also thought I was a woman, which means I&apos;m making some progress in appearing less manly.
		I&apos;ve really got to fix my voice, aside from that, I&apos;m getting there.
