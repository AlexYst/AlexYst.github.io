	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 428 grams of Aztec salad.
		I ended up having the remaining cake from yesterday for lunch.
		There was less than I&apos;d thought there was; only 109 grams.
		I had a couple glasses of vanilla almond milk, one weighing in at 302 grams, and the other at 308 grams.
		For dinner, I had 275 grams of muffuletta and 34 potato nuggets.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/13.png" alt="A mossy cobblestone post with a floating, dark grey, cubic crystal above it" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I got the floating cube texture put together.
		It&apos;s not great, but it&apos;s better than the solid colour from before.
		I might work on it further later.
		Maybe I&apos;ll just add noise to what I&apos;ve got now.
		I&apos;ve also swapped out the cobble texture of the base for the mossy cobble texture.
		I think that looks a lot better, and if these things are supposed to represent focal points for elemental powers of nature, it would make sense that they&apos;d attract life such as plant life.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m over halfway done with the palette.
		Building this palette is incredibly tedious, but I think it&apos;ll be worth it if I end up releasing the mod publicly.
		If I don&apos;t release it right away, then if I do later release it, I&apos;m not going to want to have to go back and fill in the palette at that point.
		Having the palette done near the beginning of the process is best.
		That is, unless I end up scrapping this mod like I have all the others.
		At that point, I&apos;m getting the tedious part done and skipping the interesting part instead of the reverse.
		I think this mod will work out for me, but then again, that&apos;s what I thought about all the other mods too.
	</p>
	<p>
		None of the of the palette index logic has been built yet, so the screenshot is of the coal bank, as it&apos;s got an index of zero and is the only bank I can currently acquire.

<section id="Freya">
	<h2>Freya</h2>
	<p>
		Freya wrote today asking to borrow $400 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		She already owes me $1050 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>, which is about a month&apos;s worth of pay for me.
		I almost told her I wasn&apos;t able to do that.
		In the end though, I decided to do the stupid thing, and lend her more money.
		If she doesn&apos;t start paying me back though, this will probably be the last time.
		I decided to put a stipulation on it though.
		If I lend her this money, she&apos;s got to pay it all back in cash, as that&apos;s what I lent her, and not stupid cheques or gift cards.
		She agreed, but then started talking about being friends again.
		I had to remind her that friends don&apos;t misgender one another, and that she still clearly thinks of me as a man.
		Specifically, I pointed out the last time we had a heartfelt conversation, a conversation in which she referred to me as my mother&apos;s son.
		I&apos;m not sure if I can actually get through to her, but I&apos;m certainly not going to pretend I return the sentiment when she still hasn&apos;t even once referred to me as a &quot;they&quot; instead of a &quot;he&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, that&apos;s my errand for tomorrow: making a trip to the credit union to withdraw the funds she needs delivering them to her.
