	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		I bought some vanilla almond milk as a bit of a treat last night when I was picking up the frosting for the cake today.
		I had a couple glasses of that today, a smaller one of 33 grams and a larger one of 249 grams.
		For breakfast, I had 58 grams of cereal and 185 grams of vanilla almond milk.
		For lunch, I had 138 grams of muffuletta and 41 potato nuggets.
		For dinner, I had 562 grams of Aztec salad.
		At the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, I also had an unmeasured amount of cake.

<section id="swimming">
	<h2>Swimming lessons</h2>
	<p>
		I looked into the local pool&apos;s hours yesterday, but I didn&apos;t notice that the pool was closed for maintenance at the moment.
		There&apos;s a further out pool that&apos;s open, out in Thurston, but their hours are short on Fridays, not to mention that I&apos;m not sure my swim teacher&apos;s going to want to go out that far.
		They might have a car, but for some reason, I&apos;m thinking they don&apos;t.
		If we wanted to go to that pool though, we&apos;d probably need to go on Mondays and/or Wednesdays.
		I reported my findings, as they said to email them today, then got other things done while I waited for their response.
		They never did get back to me though.
	</p>

<section id="mission">
	<h2>Secret mission</h2>
	<p>
		I got my secret mission finished today.
		It was a complete and total success.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="cake">
	<h2>Baking a cake</h2>
	<p>
		I got the cake baked today, as planned.
		I tried to draw Tux, the Linux mascot, in frosting, seeing as I was taking it to a <abbr title="Linux User Group">LUG</abbr> meeting.
		That didn&apos;t work out so well.
		I mean, this is only the second cake I&apos;ve baked, with the first being an attempt at making brownies, making this only the second attempt I&apos;ve made at drawing in frosting.
		This time, I put an under layer though.
		That turned out to be a mistake.
		First, the frosting I was decorating with wasn&apos;t able to stick to the cake, so I couldn&apos;t get those star globs going that you tend to see cakes decorated with.
		Mine came out terribly when done in white, and I couldn&apos;t get the blue frosting to come out even close to the right shape, and resorted to just extruding it in long stripes.
		(The store didn&apos;t have black frosting, so I used blue.
		One day, I might have a frosting recipe, but for now, I&apos;m too busy to try to learn new recipes.)
		Then, the frosting started melting together and losing all definition.
		What I think was going on is that the frosting I was drawing with, which was more solid, was soaking up the moisture from the softer, imitation cream cheese frosting.
		So mainly, I&apos;ve learned one thing: don&apos;t decorate on top of other frosting.
		I&apos;d put down the background layer because I didn&apos;t want to fill in the background the slow way.
		Filling in the background the slow way is probably the right way to do this though, and the way to make the cake look better.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m also just bad at drawing, which didn&apos;t help.
		Still, with what I learned today, I think I can make my next cake look a lot better.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> members ate most of the cake for me, though I did still have more than I should have, and I brought the last slice home with me.
		It&apos;s a bit larger than I should have in one sitting, but I&apos;ll probably have it in one sitting anyway.
		I might actually take it to work with me as my dinner.
		It&apos;d be easier to transport than Aztec salad, and until the cake is gone and I have my glass dish and lid back from it, I don&apos;t really have a place to put my next muffuletta.
		I&apos;ve been so boring in how I eat lately.
		It&apos;s either Aztec salad or muffuletta.
		The thing about these foods though is that I can make them in a batch, and not have to make food for a while.
		I don&apos;t feel like I have time to make food often; at least not interesting food.
		I enjoy the Aztec salad and muffuletta, and though they&apos;re no doubt boring to read that I ate again, they&apos;re delicious every time.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/12.png" alt="A detail-less cube hovering over a cobblestone post" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I went through versions of Minetest Game, Minimal, Build, and Survival from 0.4.0 through 0.4.7, finding that that was as far as I needed to go to get enough items to fill the palette with.
		Along the way, I built up the list of items I&apos;d need, but then realised that all my effort had been in vain.
		I&apos;d want to organise the palette by the versions the items had been first present in, so I&apos;d need to start back at the beginning anyway.
		At least this exercise showed me how many layers of items there&apos;d be: eight.
		I got part of the palette done at the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, but not a whole lot.
		It&apos;s going to be a slow project.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the mean time, here&apos;s a screenshot from yesterday of what the banks looked like after I&apos;d fixed the bug.
		I disabled the node&apos;s definition while I work on the palette, so I wasn&apos;t able to take a screenshot today.
		The palette didn&apos;t even have a single pixel worked out yesterday, so I used the mese block image as the palette, resulting in a mese-yellow cube.
		I&apos;ve been thinking about how formless the cube looks a lot today though.
		I think I&apos;m going to build a simple, four-by-four texture for it.
		Only two colours will be used, an outer light grey and an inner white.
		I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;ll look any good, but it&apos;ll probably at least be a bit better.
		If I had eight pixels of space, I could definitely get a good texture going, but the cube isn&apos;t that large.
		Four-by-four will have to do.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		The academic advisor&apos;s boss wrote a very short and unconvincing letter.
		I think they got the point that they&apos;re not fooling anyone, and they&apos;re done trying.
		The more they write, the more likely I am to respond, which luckily for them, means that the less they write, the less likely I am to respond.
		If you write a decently-lengthed letter, I&apos;ll write one in return, but if you start cutting your letters short, it&apos;s no longer worth my time to respond.
		I mean, unless there&apos;s still something that needs to be said, which in this case, there really isn&apos;t.
		The time to fix this mess has passed.
	</p>
	<p>
		They acknowledged that the payment options they&apos;d recommended weren&apos;t an option for me.
		They didn&apos;t actually answer a single one of my questions about payment or the payment options though.
		They also said they hope nothing will aggravate my health going forward.
		If you recall what I wrote in my last letter, I made it very clear that studying at a school that censors me does aggravate my mental health.
		I guess it&apos;s my emotional health that&apos;s impacted the most, though it does wear down on me mentally too.
		In any case, I made it clear that their claims that they hope things will somehow be fine moving forward make it sound like they&apos;re blowing me off, and that things aren&apos;t going to be better as long as I&apos;m stuck here; that things will only improve once I&apos;ve finished my courses and left.
		And now they&apos;re doing it again, which reaffirms that they&apos;re blowing me off.
		Again, it doesn&apos;t seem worth my time to respond.
		Every time I&apos;ve written to them, I&apos;ve cried the entire time I&apos;ve done so.
		It&apos;s rather taxing to deal with a representative of this school while they try to justify the school&apos;s actions and not actually go about fixing anything.
		I&apos;m too drained to write back at this point.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess that&apos;s a part of why I respond to long letters too.
		Long letters get me fired up.
		Sure, I might be even more drained after having replied to them, but I have the energy in that moment to compose the thought-out responses that they deserve.
		That&apos;s part of why I do better with learning journal assignments without length limits, too.
		I&apos;m free to get fired up about them, and pour it all out on the page.
		But when you limit my word count, I&apos;m not allowed to get fired up and let it all out, so I don&apos;t have the energy to even get them done at all.
		I then have to force myself to complete the assignments.
		If the school wasn&apos;t draining me to down below my natural baseline, I&apos;d have the energy even for short assignments, but with things the way they are, I don&apos;t.
