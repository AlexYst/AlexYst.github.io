	<h2>Jockstraps</h2>
	<p>
		I headed out today to get the jockstraps before work, but along the way, I changed my plans and headed home.
		Recently, I rubbed my skin raw when tucking.
		I assumed it was because I stretched my skin too much.
		I figured that if I did it right, I wouldn&apos;t have to stretch it hardly at all, seeing as I&apos;m trying to compact it, not make it larger.
		But I don&apos; technically know for sure that the problem was the stretching.
		I need to stop tucking long enough for my skin to heal, so I can tell when fresh damage is done, then try again.
		If I end up with raw skin again, the jock strap method I&apos;ve been using might not be a functional method, and I shouldn&apos;t buy more of the things.
		So I guess, for now, I wait.

	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		At work, the other new shift leader finally had their management uniform.
		Nice.
		They&apos;ve been stuck in the ugly orange crew member uniform, so it&apos;s nice to see they&apos;re in black with us now.
	</p>
	<p>
		We had a huddle between us two new shift leaders, one of the morning shift leaders, a shift leader that&apos;s been here for a while but is moving up in rank, and the head manager.
		We were told which two shift leaders (along with the assistant manager) we&apos;re replacing.
		We were told to watch the labour-to-business ratio, sending people home if need be.
		We were told to work as a team, to make sure we communicated with each other (especially telling one another when we send other employees on break).
		We were told to make sure we&apos;re performing regular cash drops.
		And we were told that the head manager&apos;s monthly bonus hinges on how well the store performed labour-to-income-wise.
		Finally, we were told that the head manager gives a part of their bonus, so if we keep things running well, we make more money.
		We were also informed that the store hasn&apos;t performed well this month due to how many people have quit recently.
		Many new recruits have had to be trained, and that has upped the store&apos;s labour costs.
		There&apos;s not likely to be a bonus at all this month.
		Thought not their point, that means the mass quitting hits the head manager and the shift leaders more than I&apos;d thought.
		Their point though was not to get excited for this month, but they also said that we start fresh bonus-wise next month, so if we keep the store performing well, we can expect compensation for it.
		I&apos;m sceptical as to how much we actually get, but my goal is the experience, anyway.
		And getting the most out of this experience means figuring out how to run the place efficiently.
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager apparently tried to call me in early today, but I didn&apos;t see their email to me.
		They complained that if I&apos;m not going to have a telephone, I need to be constantly checking my email.
		Um.
		I&apos;m not at your beck and call when I&apos;m off the clock, y&apos;know.
		I&apos;m not just sitting at my computer all day waiting on email to come in.
		If I had a telephone though, I&apos;d probably almost never answer it.
		When I&apos;m not home, I wouldn&apos;t know it was ringing, and when I got home, the chances of me checking the answering machine, if I even had an answering machine, would be low.
		Still, I&apos;ll see if I can get push email and email alerts set up so I&apos;ll be more likely to notice incoming email.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, I asked the employee that addresses the bosses so formally a question.
		I forget what I asked.
		They replied &quot;Yes ma&apos;am, I mean, yes sir, I mean, Alex.&quot;.
		That was kind of funny.
		It was also a bit revealing though.
		They see me more as a woman than a man, I think.
		That&apos;s nice.
		I mean, I&apos;d rather be seen as neutral, but with most people seeing me as a man, it&apos;s refreshing for someone to see me as something other than a man.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/20.png" alt="The beginnings of the bridge" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		My attempts to come up with ideas for the <code>elemental</code> mod continue.
		One thing I thought quite a bit about today was remote storage.
		You could turn it on, and as you mine, everything you mined of the relevant element would be stored not in your own inventory, but in the crystal.
		I think it could work, too.
		The results of my experiments seem to indicate that the client can&apos;t access the inventory of a node while the node isn&apos;t loaded client-side (either the client won&apos;t request node&apos;s metadata or the server won&apos;t send it), but the server can access a node&apos;s metadata strings when node shouldn&apos;t be loaded.
		Either the server loads the map block when a mod needs it or the node metadata is stored elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also came up with a new &quot;magic&quot; interface for interacting with the crystals.
		I think I can do tricky stuff with list rings (<code>listring[]</code> elements in formspecs) to have players shift click on items in their inventory and have them sent to the crystal using an invisible, public, detached inventory.
		The items would be allowed in based on the last crystal the player interacted with, and once deposited, they&apos;d be added to a crystal&apos;s count based on what player deposited it and what crystal they last interacted with.
		I&apos;d also use buttons for withdrawal: one to fill your inventory, one to withdraw one stack, and one paired with an input field to allow the withdrawal of a specific amount.
		That way, the nodes don&apos;t actually need any node inventory data.
		I haven&apos;t coded this just yet, but I have high hopes for it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I came up with a better bridge layout.
		The goal was to create something more efficient.
		I mean, using two sets of rails means I can only go half as far with the mese I dig up.
		It also requires a lot more wood, stone, or whatever a particular section of the bridge is made of.
		However, it allows me to keep the bridge in the dead centre of the map.
		The map is an even number of nodes wide, so having a single rail in the middle isn&apos;t exactly possible for a centred bridge.
		I thought about having the bridge centred but only having a rail on one side, but I didn&apos;t really like how that would look.
		I could claim one side was for pedestrians, but pedestrians can walk on the rails, as carts and riders pass right through them.
		I could claim it was for realism, but in that case, I&apos;d still need that second set of rails so carts going opposite directions didn&apos;t crash.
		My new plan though off-centres the rails in a way that controls their direction.
		At a junction, a rail turning left will suck carts in by default, while a rail turning right will spit them out.
		this is due to the junction being two by two circles and the default direction at junctions being to turn left.
		With all left entrances, you&apos;ll spin in a circle at the junction, while with all right turns, you&apos;ll leave at the first exit.
		With a mix, you can control which exit is the default one for players to leave from.
		To put it simply, if you make a circle, the carts will move in it in an anticlockwise direction as soon as they&apos;re given the chance to.
		And if a rail leads away from the circle such that they&apos;d be pointed toward that rail while moving in that anticlockwise direction, they&apos;ll take it.
		However, if they&apos;d have to be moving clockwise to face that rail, they&apos;ll never take that rail without player intervention.
		You can hold the direction you want to travel to override this and go the direction you want to, but by default, with my new rail layout, carts will be drawn from all around the main rail network to the centre of the map.
		The auxiliary rails won&apos;t all have this property, but if you&apos;re travelling on the main roads and step away from your computer long enough, you&apos;ll always be drawn back to World&apos;s Navel.
		If an auxiliary road puts you onto the main road, but puts you travelling down that road in the wrong direction, you&apos;ll automatically turn around and go back as soon as you hit one of the main junctions.
		Personally, I think that&apos;s a really neat setup.
		An alternative I came up with was to push everyone <strong>*away*</strong> from World&apos;s Navel, but in that setup, you&apos;d be pushed to one of the four corners of the main network, and you wouldn&apos;t always end up in the same place.
		That seems significantly less neat.

<section id="bicycle">
	<h2>Bicycle</h2>
	<p>
		The axle of my bike&apos;s pedals is getting pretty bad.
		It wobbles around in its socket as I pedal the bike.
		It&apos;s been doing that a while, but it&apos;s only getting worse, and I have no idea how to fix it.
		Is this why my former neighbour was so willing to simply abandon the bike when they moved out?
		Or am I just really hard on bicycles?
		I mean, the other bike they abandoned had issues too.
		The one pedal wasn&apos;t even attached to the bike when I received it, and every time I attached the pedal, it soon came back off.
		There&apos;s a good chance they knew this bike also had problems.
		Those problems could have been limited to the gear-shift problems I was dealing with previously though, and I might have cause the axle issue.
