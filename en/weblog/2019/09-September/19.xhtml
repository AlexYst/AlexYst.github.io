	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		Due to my nap, I ended up away way too late last night.
		I got hungry, and ate the 444-gram pizza in my freezer.
		I&apos;d intended it to be two meals, and I ate it as one.
		Lovely.
		Just in time for the weigh-in at today&apos;s dietary meeting, too.
		For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I had 148, 95, and 125 grams of muffuletta.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was never intending to keep this food intake log going forever, but just to the dietary course.
		Today ended that course, so this is the final dietary log.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="mobile">
	<h2>Mobile</h2>
	<p>
		This morning has seen a back and forth in what my plans to salvage my photographs will be.
		At first, I figured I&apos;d get a one-day pass from one of the carriers in town and use it to email myself the photos.
		I&apos;d do this either today or tomorrow.
		But then I realised I could just shelve the device and deal with getting the photos later.
		What&apos;s the rush?
		I mean, they won&apos;t show up in my journal on time, but they&apos;d get there eventually.
		But then I remembered how corroded the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> port appears to be.
		I&apos;m not sure that&apos;ll ever start working again.
		And if it doesn&apos;t, I have no way to charge the device.
		The battery will slowly drain even if removed from the device, though it&apos;ll drain much slower outside the device.
		Still, I have a time frame in which I can even get the photos back at all.
		They&apos;re not special, but I&apos;d still prefer to have them in my journal over not hove them.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I set out today to get a one-day plan.
		The carrier I knew had them in the past no longer has them.
		The salesperson just kept trying to insist that I get a full plan, then suspend it after emailing the photos.
		That way, my airtime wouldn&apos;t tick down, but I&apos;d still be buying a full plan.
		I kept saying I didn&apos;t want the full month, as I just needed the one day, and I&apos;d try another carrier, but they kept pushing.
		They tried selling me a device.
		When I wouldn&apos;t take an Android with proprietary blobs, they tried pushing an iPhone.
		I don&apos;t think they at all understood the problem; the iPhone&apos;s operating system, iOS, is <strong>*one big proprietary blob*</strong>.
		There&apos;s nothing usable in between, like you see with Android.
		I explained that, then also mentioned that because you can&apos;t install applications from outside the Apple application store, whatever it is they&apos;re calling it, I can&apos;t get the device to run anything I&apos;d actually need it to anyway.
		They asked about where I would get a suitable device, and I explained that it took over a month to find one online.
		And I explained about how the United States doesn&apos;t sell the standard versions of the devices, so no local stores have them.
		They still pushed for that suspended service, and eventually asked if it&apos;d take over a month to get a new device, which I assumed meant that the suspended service would expire after a month of inactivity.
		I didn&apos;t think to ask though because whether it did or not, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be getting another mobile any time soon.
		I&apos;m tired of dealing with all this mess.
		And I&apos;m tired of dealing with a device that can&apos;t even connect to Wi-Fi.
		Eventually, they let me go.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess I might get a Librem 5 when they come out just to have a device that should theoretically function.
		With how bad of an experience I&apos;ve had on my Librem 15 though, I fear getting a Librem 5.
		Sure, the hardware will run fully free systems right out of the box.
		Sure, it&apos;ll have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, two things I&apos;ve never had in a mobile device.
		Sure, it&apos;s got a camera, which is the main thing I use my janky, broken-down mobile for.
		Sure, it&apos;ll no doubt be able to play my music, which is the thing I used to use my mobile for.
		But what usability problems will be introduced, both by the hardware and the software?
		I never expected something as idiotic as a lack of mouse buttons on a laptop.
		I could have accepted a lack of a middle mouse button, but no separate right and left mouse buttons?
		What kind of asinine garbage is this?
		Honestly, I started thinking to myself that if <a href="/en/domains/taylor.local.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a> ever broke down and I couldn&apos;t find a suitable second-hand laptop, I&apos;d get a ThinkPenguin machine.
		If I couldn&apos;t repair <code>taylor</code>.
		I&apos;m pretty sure Purism supports the replacing of parts and the performing of maintenance and repairs.
		I mean, first, I&apos;d scrutinise the product images to be sure they had mouse buttons, but once I confirmed there were proper mouse buttons, I&apos;d get something other than a Purism machine.
		But then I ended up reading Purism&apos;s goals again, and they&apos;re working toward hardware with open specifications.
		As poorly-designed as these idiotic touch pads are, I have an ethical obligation to put my money toward a company that&apos;s trying to pave the way for a better world in computing.
		Someone else can take those specifications and build machines with actual mouse buttons.
		For now, I have no choice but to stick with the one company I know to be doing the right thing, even if they&apos;re doing it in an idiotic and not-at-all user-friendly way.
		My use of this machine isn&apos;t about ease, but about a better future that I won&apos;t live to see.
		But while I need a laptop, or at least a desktop, I don&apos;t really need a mobile.
		I can live without one.
		Then again, I might get one just as a conversation-starter.
		I just don&apos;t know.
		And the point is moot for the time being, as they haven&apos;t even been released yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried a second carrier, one I didn&apos;t think would have day plans, but was in the area so I checked.
		Indeed, they didn&apos;t have them.
		They recommended buying the full month of service, then just using the one day.
		That was no good though, if I could avoid it.
		I mean, I&apos;d be using the service for less than an hour, but paying the full month&apos;s price.
		That&apos;s a pretty expensive partial hour!
	</p>
	<p>
		I was about to head to a third place, but realised I might be able to borrow a <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card and data plan at <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr>.
		The meetings are about three-hours long.
		People often show up half an hour to an hour late.
		That gives me two full hours to email several photos.
		That&apos;s far more time than I need.
		Maybe someone at the meeting would help me out.
		But then I realised that I don&apos;t have KeePassDroid installed, nor did I have my encrypted database on the device any more.
		Both had been wiped while I was trying to just make the thing function.
		I couldn&apos;t get into my account to email anything.
		Then I thought about manual password entry.
		Oh.
		Yeah.
		That&apos;s still a thing.
		I haven&apos;t done it in so long that I&apos;d forgotten it was an actual possibility.
		But with KeePassDroid wiped, so was Orbot.
		I can&apos;t safely email myself the photos.
		So I figured I&apos;d give up.
		But then I realised I could install it again through F-Droid.
		I can&apos;t install that way without a network connection, but I&apos;d have a network connection.
		And then I realised that the version available these days is proprietary.
		I can&apos;t in good conscience install that.
		I&apos;d rather lose the photos.
		And then I realised I could probably upload the outdated version I use, which is fully free, to some place I could then download it from.
		I was back on track.
	</p>
	<p>
		Except ...
		I was starting to feel bad about everything I was going to need to use their data plan for.
		My photos are super low-resolution.
		I take low-resolution photos so they&apos;ll be a better size for on my webpages.
		But still, they add up.
		And then there was Orbot, which is quite a bit larger than any of my photos.
		Again, I figured I&apos;d just let the photographs rot.
		And then I realised I could try paying to use the <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card and date plan.
		Five dollars would more than cover my fraction of the usage of the plan, but I could offer ten just to be generous.
		I wouldn&apos;t feel as ripped off either, paying a fellow Linux user instead of some mega corporation that&apos;s known to screw over their customers.
		So that became my plan.
	</p>
	<p>
		I posted on <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>, explaining the situation and offering the ten dollars.
		One of the other members recommended a plan that doesn&apos;t seem to be available any more from T-Mobile or a FreedomPop plan.
		I&apos;d forgotten about FreedomPop.
		I bought the <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> kit from them, as they claimed the plan came with voice minutes.
		I never make calls, and at that time, only really received calls from my workplace, which didn&apos;t happen very often.
		The few voice minutes they offered on their gratis plan would be more than enough, and I wouldn&apos;t have a telephone bill any more.
		However, after buying the <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr>, they immediately told me the actual situation.
		They offer zero actual voice minutes and zero actual <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages.
		They instead offer a proprietary application with the plan that allows you to fake having those things over an Internet connection.
		As installing proprietary software obviously wasn&apos;t an option, and the data allowance was too puny, the plan was useless to me.
		I tried to cancel the order, but there was no option to do that.
		So I ended up with a <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> I never used.
		But would a <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card I&apos;d never used actually still be active after all that time?
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried logging into my old account online.
		Surprisingly, my credentials were still recognised.
		A popup pseudo-window informed me that due to inactivity, my account was &quot;dormant&quot;, and gave me the option to &quot;wake it up&quot;.
		After doing that, it recommended I restart the device.
		I thought that was kind of funny.
		The device was powered off in my purse with the battery removed.
		I&apos;d removed it at first because it refused to power off, instead rebooting every time I told it to shut down.
		I&apos;d left it out to conserve power once I realised I needed to buy time though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I powered on the device with the <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card, and found it immediately recognised.
		The device had reception, but I wasn&apos;t sure the thing had a network connection, so I tried to find the <abbr title="Access Point Name">APN</abbr> settings.
		Before I could reach them though (and it took me a while to find them), the signal dropped out.
		I found the <abbr title="Access Point Name">APN</abbr> settings, verified that they were correct, and tried rebooting.
		I also tried biking downtown where I thought there might be better reception.
		But no.
		I think the radio on this thing is out.
		The device is completely isolated, unable to communicate with other machines.
		I&apos;ve lost the photos.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/19.png" alt="The more-permanent tree farm" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I built enough of the bridge to see where it&apos;ll be, then set up what will probably be my permanent tree farm and tore down the temporary one.
		The problem with Sleepless Isle was that I started building the permanent features of the area before I had the bridge up.
		I had to stay clear of that area to be sure I wouldn&apos;t interfere with the future bridge, and ended up scrunched on the other side of the island.
		I didn&apos;t make use of the space on the other side of the bridge at all.
		Additionally, because I got started building what I&apos;d use before I even had the island&apos;s terrain set up, I scrunched myself on the small part I&apos;d finished, cutting what space I used even further, and most of the space on my island was wasted.
		This time, I&apos;m not putting in anything permanent until I have a better idea of where it should be.
		I&apos;ve got chests set up outside on the ground just to keep the place functional for the time being, but that&apos;s it.
		I had the temporary tree farm, but that was just one snow block and one dirt block per tree.
		Not that much to remove.
		And now, I&apos;ve got the actual tree farm taking up the small, nearly unusable space on the other side of where the bridge is, making that place actually useful.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t like the way the remnant system makes me think.
		It&apos;s got me trying to exploit it already, and in idiotic ways.
		I mean, I&apos;m trying to convert iron, the most-valuable material in the game world, into sand, which I plan to destroy.
		What a waste!
		And then, I also have no tracks, because I can&apos;t spare the iron.
		I&apos;ve got to destroy it as sand.
		I might end up scrapping the remnant idea.
		Or I might have it disabled by default, and administrators can enable it.
		The problem with that second idea though is that I wanted it to be discovered accidentally.
		For example, maybe some player would try to store steel ingots in their iron elemental crystal, and end up with ash in their inventory.
		They&apos;d post about it, and I&apos;d ask what happens if they try storing the ask in the crystal.
		Or maybe they&apos;d recommend I make the crystal store steel ingots, and I&apos;d act all confused, asking them what sort of error they were getting when they tried to store the steel ingots, prompting them to actually try it.
		People would either check the code, or simply experiment and find other odd items that way too.
		I don&apos;t know.
		I&apos;m going to need to think about this some more.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="dietary">
	<h2>Dietary meeting</h2>
	<p>
		When I got up this morning, I remembered I had a dietary meeting, which has been on my mind for the past few days.
		I grabbed my dietary binder, and set it where I&apos;d have easy access to it when I headed out.
		I still had several hours though, so I wasn&apos;t ready to grab it and go just yet.
		I got a few blocks before I realised I&apos;d left the binder at home.
		This would be the second time I&apos;d left it, which would be particularly embarrassing considering that the other time had been just last week.
		I had time though, so I went back for it.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I arrived at the hospital, I found I was locked out of the stairwell.
		That was odd.
		I&apos;d entered a room connected to the outside of the building, with four other doors.
		One led to a parking lot, one to the upward stairwell, one to the downward stairwell (which was the same stairwell, but with metal bars separating the two so you have to choose the door corresponding to the direction you want to go), and one to the main building.
		I tried the door to the main building next, expecting that to be locked too.
		I figured I&apos;d need to exit the building and come in through another entrance.
		The door was unlocked though, and there was a security guard in the hall.
		The information desk was empty, so I looked around, then approached the security guard, thinking they might know the building layout well enough to direct me to another stairwell.
		Instead, they informed me that the hospital was on &quot;modified lock-down&quot;, and that all the stairwells were closed.
		They then directed me to the elevators.
		I later asked the dietitian about it, and they said that they weren&apos;t aware of the lock-down, but that a patient had left yesterday against medical advice, then started threatening people, so that was likely the cause for the lock-down.
		They were probably worried about someone dangerous hiding in the stairwells.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems on <a href="/en/weblog/2019/05-May/23.xhtml">May 23</a>, I was 110 kilograms.
		By <a href="/en/weblog/2019/07-July/18.xhtml">July 18</a>, I&apos;d dropped to 101.6 kilograms.
		Now, I&apos;ve dropped to 98.4545 kilograms.
		I&apos;m very disappointed.
		That&apos;s not nearly as much of a drop.
		It&apos;s hardly anything!
		This month, my goal was to stop limiting myself as much.
		My best guess is that for the prior month, I lost weight, and this month, I&apos;ve gained most of it back.
		This clearly isn&apos;t working, and I need to go back to limiting my food intake more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Only three of us showed up, which didn&apos;t include the one that gave me the swimsuit last time.
		It seems we won&apos;t be meeting up after all; this was our last meeting, so the last jance we&apos;d ever see one another, seeing as we never exchanged contact information.
		This time when we introduced ourselves, we told each other about something we procrastinate on.
		The dietitian procrastinates on dealing with complicated computer things.
		One of the participants procrastinates on getting up in the morning.
		The other said they procrastinate on &quot;anything&quot;.
		That seems like a bit of a cop-out.
	</p>
	<p>
		We were told that the general consensus is that when you&apos;re watching your weight, you should weigh yourself once each week.
		However, it was also stated that there can benefit to a daily weigh-in: it keeps your mind on the goal.
		However, it&apos;s important to remember that weight fluctuates day to day, so some days you&apos;ll get heavier, and it doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re doing something wring.
	</p>
	<p>
		We talked about sleep epnea too.
		I&apos;d never heard of that condition by name, but it seems it&apos;s the condition where you don&apos;t get enough oxygen when you&apos;re sleeping.
		You may or may not wake up, but even if you don&apos;t, it messes with the quality of your sleep.
	</p>
	<p>
		The importance of vitamin D supplements was brought up, so I mentioned being unable to find any without gelatin as the main reason I don&apos;t take them.
		Another participant recommended a health store in Eugene, so I&apos;ll have to check that out when dime allows.
		Come to think of it though, we never discussed <strong>*why*</strong> vitamin D is important, only that practically everyone in our region is vitamin-D-deficient due to usually-overcast weather causing a lack of sun exposure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, it seems weight-bearing exercise helps build bone strength.
		That probably involves weight gain, not weight loss, but is still a direction you&apos;d want to head.
		If you don&apos;t want brittle bones in your old age, getting in weight-bearing exercise is a good idea.
	</p>
	<p>
		The dietitian then tried to have us watch a video on Google&apos;s video service, YouTube, but Google blocked the video on us.
		I&apos;m not sure why.
		Google has a habit of not playing nicely with <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>-users, but as far as I know, the dietitian&apos;s machine wasn&apos;t running <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>; only mine was, which wasn&apos;t even connected to the Internet.
		I just brought it to take notes on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Someone mentioned the hassle of Daylight Saving Time, and another participant said they thought our Congress had passed a bill abolishing Daylight Saving Time in this country.
		Seriously?
		Is Daylight Saving Time over?
		<strong>*FINALLY*!?</strong>
		I did some research when I got home, and as far as I can tell, that bill hasn&apos;t passed yet.
		I can&apos;t find any recent reference to it, actually.
		But the older results do show that such a bill was written and Congress was attempting to pass it.
		They&apos;re calling the new time, which is equivalent to Daylight Saving Time always being in effect, &quot;Forward Time&quot;.
		I don&apos;t really care whether we keep the clocks in Standard Time or Daylight Time, as long as we pick one and stick with it.
		I do find the choice to switch to Daylight Time permanently instead of Standard Time a bit odd, but either way, I fully support this decision, and I <strong>*really*</strong> hope the bill passes.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems that the order of what you eat in a meal influences insulin production.
		Also, lowering insulin production can help you lose weight?
		I&apos;m not sure why that would be.
		But anyway, you want to start out your meal with the non-starchy vegetables and the protein.
		You want to save the starchy vegetables for last.
		Interesting.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lastly, we then went through suggestions from a magazine article.
		First, drink less alcohol.
		I don&apos;t drink any, so that&apos;s as good as that&apos;s going to get.
		Next, eating chickpeas, beans, and lentils help with weight loss.
		Including them in your diet, regardless of what else you eat, somehow helps.
		The dietitian brought up that this might not be a special property of these foods, but instead, just a basic benefit of high fibre intake.
		Getting prebiotics in your diet also helps.
		These are found in leaks, asparagus, onion, garlic, spinach, beans, bananas, oats, and soybeans
		I&apos;m not a fan of asparagus, and bananas tend to go bad on my too quickly to be convenient.
		The others seem like viable options for me though.
		I think leaks are like onions, so if I go back to making improvised soups, leaks might be a good thing to try in them.
		I&apos;ve never had whole soybeans, but I have them in things such s tofu and soy milk.
		The rest are foods I enjoy when I find the time to prepare them.
		Probiotics help too, but seem to mostly come from non-vegan foods.
		It seems that <em>*maybe*</em> there are vegan options?
		Fermented foods seem to be the key, so maybe vegan fermented foods would have them.
		Bursts of intense exercise with breaks burns more energy than moderate but continuous exercise, which is kind of odd.
		Useful to know though.
		Pumping iron helps lose fat and retain muscle more than other types of activity.
		I don&apos;t have the time or the space for barbels though for the time being.
		It&apos;s recommended that you stand for at least six hours per day.
		I asked if walking around, such as having a job that requires you to be on your feet, counts.
		It does.
		If you&apos;ve got to sit, it was recommended that you get up every thirty minutes to stretch a bit.
		Weighing yourself daily, which we discussed previously, was recommended by the article too.
		Also, dieting on and off was recommended.
		You spend two weeks dieting, then two weeks not dieting, to try to trick your body.
		You keep it from getting used to the lower calorie intake, so you can keep your metabolism up.
		The article also recommended sharing your dieting experiences by blogging.
		And finally, it recommended getting a proper amount of sleep.

		I forget how it came up, but someone asked me about how often I&apos;ve been weighing in, so I replied that I hadn&apos;t found the time to get a scale.
		I&apos;ve actually been planning to for a while, but I thought it&apos;d be too big of a challenge to find one in stores.
		I mean, I&apos;m on Metric, while most of my country&apos;s still on the country&apos;s country-specific measuring system like some sort of imbeciles.
		If I&apos;m buying a scale, I want to get one that&apos;ll tell me my weight in kilograms without any sort of manual conversions.
		That means searching for the right scale, which is a time commitment.
		I just don&apos;t have the time right now.
		One of the other participants offered me their scale.
		That was nice of them!
		It might mean manual conversions, but it&apos;d certainly give me something to work with until I find my own scale.
		They say it&apos;s digital though, so there&apos;s a good chance it can be set to &quot;Metric mode&quot; or something and I can use this as my permanent scale.
		It seems they bought one of those creepy scales that uploads their data to some corporation across the Internet, so they stopped using their network-isolated scale.
		It&apos;s just sitting around, taking up space for them.
		I can&apos;t pick it up today, but we&apos;ll set up a time on another day, and they actually live in Springfield not far from me, not in Eugene where the dietary meetings are.

	<h2>Camera issues</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gone back to using my cheap, digital camera now that I don&apos;t have a working mobile any more.
		I set the date on the thing just today, so I assumed it&apos;d have the correct date when I took a photograph later.
		But no.
		I didn&apos;t pay attention, and it set itself backwards by two days.
		By the time I realised, it was too late to get a replacement photo.
		It has issues, but at least the camera communicates with the laptop though, unlike the mobile.
