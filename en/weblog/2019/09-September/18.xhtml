	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 194 grams of muffuletta.
		For lunch, I had another 295 grams as well as 234 grams of Aztec salad.
		When I got home, I had 229 grams muffuletta, and I had another 99 grams with 32 potato nuggets for dinner.

<section id="swimming">
	<h2>Swimming lessons</h2>
	<p>
		When I awoke, I found it was raining.
		I thought my workmate might call the lessons off, so I checked my email.
		They&apos;d asked me if I was calling them off, but as I&apos;d been asleep and hadn&apos;t responded, they assumed I would be there, and had gone to meet me.
		They live further out than I do, so they had to get up earlier and leave sooner.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started getting ready to go.
		I wasn&apos;t sure if the pool would have a gender-neutral changing area, so I had to assume the worst.
		I put my swimsuit on, intending to wear my clothing on top of it.
		If worst came to worst, I wouldn&apos;t even need a changing room.
		But then I saw my back.
		It was way too hairy.
		I don&apos;t often shave it because I can&apos;t reach it very well.
		But also, I tend to keep my back covered, so it works out normally.
		I&apos;d gotten up with plenty of time to get ready, but spent most of that time struggling to shave my back.
		And then I noticed my armpits.
		Those didn&apos;t take long to shave, but I was already running way late at that point.
		Luckily, I caught up with my workmate before they even got to the meeting place: our workplace.
		I hadn&apos;t made them wait.
	</p>
	<p>
		We biked for about an hour in the rain.
		I don&apos;t mind the rain myself, but I felt bad for my workmate.
	</p>
	<p>
		We got there, and the cashier asked us if we were here for the class or the lap pool.
		I wasn&apos;t sure what we&apos;d qualify as from those choices, and explained that my companion was teaching me how to swim.
		It turns out the main pool was closed for the class, and wouldn&apos;t open until 11:00.
		I didn&apos;t know what to do.
		I was confused, as the website said the pool would be open.
		The cashier said we could try the lap pool, so I agreed to that and tried to hand them my credit card (Freya borrowed the last of my cash), but then they said it was on the house this time.
		Nice!
		So we got in gratis this time.
		They then directed us to the changing area, telling us where the family change rooms and the gendered changing rooms were.
		I was surprised to learn they had those family changing rooms - gender-neutral rooms I could change in.
	</p>
	<p>
		My workmate went into one of the family rooms, while I simply stripped outside, already having my swimwear on.
		When they came out, they thought my choice in swimwear was an &quot;interesting choice&quot;.
		They know I&apos;m non-binary, so I can&apos;t expose my chest, as that&apos;s a man-specific thing to do.
		What was I to wear?
		I passed it off as all I had on short notice, which was half true.
		I could have picked up a different top when I picked up a replacement bottom, but I didn&apos;t have time to have even considered the possibility.
		By the time we left, I&apos;d decided the top might be too large though.
		It&apos;s a bit loose.
		Unlike the bottom, I think I might be able to take in the seam on the top, but doing that well will take some consideration.
		I don&apos;t want to stretch the crack in the chest, but instead take in seam at that spot, to cover my chest a bit better.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can float now kind of.
		I can paddle on my back across the pool sometimes, too.
		I&apos;m doing it wrong though.
		I&apos;m exerting too much energy, so it&apos;s extremely tiring.
		It&apos;s not just that I&apos;m not used to the energy expenditure, either.
		My workmate was the one saying I&apos;m exerting more energy than I need to, but when I try to not paddle as hard, I sink.
		My workmate thought I&apos;d pick it up faster than I am, but I did make some progress.
		Personally, I wasn&apos;t sure how well I&apos;d do, but I assumed it&apos;d take more than just one day to get the basics.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems my workmate was considering not coming today, but their partner insisted that they go.
		They&apos;re a bit of a recluse, so getting out of the house doesn&apos;t come easy for them.
		They&apos;ve said in the past though that they don&apos;t want to be a recluse, so it&apos;s probably good for them to have to go out sometimes.
		They also said they want to do this again next week, at the same time.
	</p>
	<p>
		My hair got tangled really badly in the pool, and I ended up ripping more of it out when I was trying to brush it.
		I mentioned that maybe I should use bobby pins, and my workmate was worried those could put out someone&apos;s eye.
		So I thought maybe clips would be a better idea, but they didn&apos;t like that idea either.
		They didn&apos;t say why.
		Instead, they thought I should just use a hairband.
		I was already wearing one though.
		The thing is that during the stressful period I was dealing with the tuition issue, I ended up ripping a lot of my hair in frustration.
		I didn&apos;t grab it an yank, but I was too frustrated to properly care for it and take the time to brush from the bottom up, and that really did a number on it.
		I also forgot to bring underwear, seeing as I&apos;d come with my swimsuit already on instead, so I had to ride home without them.
		That was a bit odd.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got home, I was way too tired to do anything productive.
		I ended up just taking a nap.
		I really wore myself out more than I&apos;d realised at first.
		I actually planned to go shopping for more jock straps after we parted ways.
		I&apos;ve only got the one, and if I&apos;m going to be tucking every day, it&apos;d be nice to have a fresh one each day.
		That didn&apos;t happen though.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/18.png" alt="My makeshift tree farm" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		When I got up from my nap, I really wasn&apos;t feeling up to much, so I played some Minetest.
		I started a makeshift tree farm early.
		I figured that way, I could get started on other projects.
		I built one of the two dams early, then turned to the other.
		Coal ore was in the way of construction.
		I got fed up with not having a pick.
		So I made wooden pick early, then mined away the floating rocks in the area for stone picks.
		I&apos;d intended to keep the floating rocks this time, and I regretted removing them.
		But then I realised they would look fine in an ruins or natural-looking area, but probably wouldn&apos;t look good &quot;in town&quot;, so I should remove them anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		I mined a third of a stack of sandstone, intending to mine it all away.
		That&apos;d save me a lot of chest space.
		However, I found it ate picks too quickly.
		I finished off the stack, but stopped there.
		I need a healthy cobble supply before I try that again.
	</p>
	<p>
		I cleared away the sand in the way to build the second dam.
		This is the dam built into the legs of the bridge.
		I thought I could use a narrower bridge this time because I&apos;m not using rails.
		Might actually need the wide bridge to give space between the legs of the bridge though, but I&apos;m going to try to redesign it to be thinner.
	</p>
	<p>
		I need to think of a drained version of rail before I can move forward with my mod.
		Once I have that item worked out though, I can begin work on the textures and code, and have the drained glass - which is now ash, not char.
		Once I have enough stone to mine the sandstone and have this part of the mod built, I can cook my silver sand, then drain it of beach sand store ash instead, which will stack much higher than the silver sand would have.
	</p>

<section id="mobile">
	<h2>Dying mobile</h2>
	<p>
		I tried to download my photos to my laptop tonight so I could get my website update completed, only to find that the device was no longer talking to the laptop.
		Joy.
		To make matters worse, it wasn&apos;t just today&apos;s photos I lost.
		I also didn&apos;t transfer yesterday&apos;s photos yesterday when I should have.
	</p>
	<p>
		After trying for quite a while to figure out what the problem was, I found that the inside of the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> port was badly corroded.
		I&apos;d blame the pool air or the rain today, but it looks like this has been going on for quite a while.
		Maybe the environment today finished it off, but this device has been getting closer to giving out for a while.
		It seems the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> port&apos;s gotten bad enough that the mobile not only won&apos;t transfer date over it, but also won&apos;t charge over it.
		I figured I&apos;d shelve the device for now.
		I think the thing is beyond repair.
		It&apos;s had problem after problem since I got the thing, and it was probably already badly damaged when it was sent to me.
		I mean, I know for a fact that the battery was cracked when I got the thing.
		There was probably damage to the actual device too, and it&apos;s only continued to deteriorate.
		Eventually, I&apos;d have a <abbr title="subscriber identity module">SIM</abbr> card for another device maybe though, and I&apos;d use it at that time to rescue the photos.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, I soon realised that with the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> port out, the clock is ticking on me.
		I can&apos;t charge the device.
		I removed the battery, which should slow down my timer drastically, but even unused batteries drain, just much more slowly.
		Either today or tomorrow, I should get a one-day data pass and email the photos to myself while there&apos;s still time and I&apos;m thinking about it.
		My website update is scheduled for today, but I&apos;ll postpone it until I&apos;ve gotten the photos recovered.
