	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 155 grams of muffuletta.
		I sort of had two lunches, but they were both smaller than usual.
		For each, I had 118 grams of muffuletta.
		I didn&apos;t plan the identical measurement of both, but that&apos;s what happened.
		For dinner, I had 139 grams of muffuletta and 41 potato nuggets.
	</p>

<section id="journalling">
	<h2>Journalling</h2>
	<p>
		As I mentioned yesterday, I needed to catch up.
		Catch up on what?
		Well, journalling.
		I&apos;ve been so focused on trying to get my computers working right, both the mobile and <a href="/en/
		domains/taylor.local.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a>, that I haven&apos;t kept up on writing about what&apos;s been going on.
		When I&apos;m bashing my head against the wall due to a technical issue, I tend not to write like I should.
		Now that i think of it, it&apos;s probably due to where the problem is.
		If I have a non-computer problem, I can step away from the problem for a while to write about it.
		But when I have a computer problem, I can&apos;t.
		Writing is done at my computer, so writing necessarily means I&apos;m sitting right there at the location of the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		So anyway, I got my journal caught up today.
		Just in time too, as my scheduled website update was tonight.
		I&apos;m at a loss as to what my update schedule should be during this forced off term, so I&apos;m just going with the same schedule I&apos;d have if I were taking courses.
		Basically, the update schedule is currently based on the due dates of the coursework I&apos;m not currently actually allowed to be doing.
	</p>

<section id="computer">
	<h2>Thoughts on this computer</h2>
	<p>
		I found a setting in the configuration application that allows you to make scrolling work forward instead of backwards.
		Nice!
		I&apos;m definitely enabling that.
		Or rather, I&apos;m disabling it, as it&apos;s actually a setting to make the scrolling work backwards, it&apos;s just that it&apos;s enabled by default.
		Get this though.
		It&apos;s labelled as &quot;Natural Scrolling&quot;.
		It&apos;s exactly the opposite of what would be intuitive, but the developers think it&apos;s the &quot;natural&quot; way to do it.
		Wow.
		Just wow.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought I found a way to disable the tap-with-one-finger-to-click thing too, which has been getting on my nerves.
		You slightly brush the touchpad with your hand as you type, and suddenly, you&apos;re typing in the wrong spot.
		but no.
		When I disabled that, the two-finger and three-finger taps, which are the only way to left- and middle-click on this infernal machine, were also disabled.
		Oh well, guess I&apos;ll just have to continue dealing with that garbage.
		There&apos;s a setting to disable the touchpad when the keyboard is in use, which I&apos;ve been using, but I&apos;ve got to keep flipping that setting back and forth depending on what I&apos;m doing.
		For Minetest, I absolutely need that setting disabled, or I can&apos;t change turn the camera to look around.
		But if I don&apos;t re-enable it when I&apos;m typing, the jumping cursor gets rather annoying.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve found that on this machine, I don&apos;t have to enter my passphrase to unlock my <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> key when I compile my website, which is rather disconcerting.
		I think I entered it the first time, but after that, the machine saved the passphrase so I don&apos;t have to enter it again.
		Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s incredibly convenient.
		It also feels incredibly insecure though.
		The purpose of <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> isn&apos;t convenience, but security.

<section id="baking">
	<h2>Getting ready to bake</h2>
	<p>
		I needed to get out for my daily bike ride today, and thought about whether I needed anything at the store.
		I could have returned bottles or something, but really didn&apos;t want to lug them today.
		I couldn&apos;t think of anything I needed, and nearly left to just bike down the bike path for a bit, but then remembered that I should make sure I have all the ingredients I&apos;ll need for the cake tomorrow.
		Surprisingly, I had everything.
		I thought I was out of vanilla extract, but I even had that.
		So I went down the bike path.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before I turned in for the night though, I remembered I had no frosting.
		I&apos;d checked my recipe, but of course I hadn&apos;t included what you top it with.
		I wouldn&apos;t have done that even if it hadn&apos;t been a failed brownie recipe, but as it was intended to make brownies, it wasn&apos;t intended to involve frosting at all.
		So a trip to the store turned out necessary anyway.
		Today was decently productive though, so I didn&apos;t mind the added time expenditure.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/11.png" alt="The energy crystal, which should be a solid colour, instead has the cobble texture. Cool-looking, but won&apos;t work well for all elements." class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I got to work in Blender, trying to create the model for my bank nodes.
		I still don&apos;t know how to use Blender, but I thought I would remember what to do from last time.
		I didn&apos;t.
		It took quite a lot of time, but I managed to get something close to what I was after set up.
		I had a pretty good idea of what I was after, aside form the measurements.
		I wanted a post sticking out of the ground, potentially with a flared base, and definitely with a cobble texture.
		Atop it, I wanted a hovering cube, standing on its corner, and having only a single, unshaded colour.
		if I could get some shading based on lighting direction, that&apos;d be great, but Minetest doesn&apos;t have that feature, and unshaded would be better than having some sides arbitrarily darker than others.
	</p>
	<p>
		Previously, through trial and error, I found that 1.28 units in blender was one metre in Minetest.
		Today, that no longer seemed to be the case.
		When I finally figured out how to set object sizes again, I found that 1.28 was too large, and he conversion ratio is now one to one.
		I simply needed to make things the correct size in Blender, and they were automatically the correct size in Minetest.
		I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s different this time, but I assume I did something majorly wrong last time, and that this time, i got it right.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also found yet another way this stupid, single-button mouse can be a pain in my neck.
		In Blender, to change your viewing angle, you middle click and drag the scene.
		I needed to reach the other side of my model so I could select all the correct edges to cut at when unwrapping the model onto the texture.
		On a Librem Laptop, there are no right or middle mouse buttons, much to my frustration.
		The end solution was an accessibility option in Blender that allows you to set the program to use the alt key in combination with the left mouse button - which is the only mouse button Librem laptops have - to reposition the scene instead.
		What a pain that that even needed to be found and enabled though.
		And not all programs are going to be as kind to users as blender.
		Taking away the hardware mouse buttons is asinine.
	</p>
	<p>
		At first, I couldn&apos;t get the model to render correctly in Minetest.
		The cobble texture was correctly applied to the post, but was incorrectly also applied to the floating &quot;crystal&quot; above the post.
		I&apos;m still not sure what the problem is, but I can get the model working by exporting it with the &quot;material groups&quot; option enabled, then re-importing it, and exporting it with the same option enabled again.
		I&apos;m at a loss as to why it has to be exported twice, but with how little I use Blender, this isn&apos;t going to come up again any time soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the model in hand, my next step is to define the translation tables and the palette.
		I&apos;m not going with an evenly-spaced palette this time, but instead, colours found by taking the average value of the pixels of the relevant textures.
		Also though, and this is the part that&apos;ll take a while, I&apos;m filling up all the empty space with dummy items.
		These&apos;ll be items from early versions of Minetest Game.
		I&apos;ll start at 0.4.0 and work my way up until I have enough items to fill the space.
		The basic idea is to obscure the fact that older, removed stats are still supported, making them a harder bonus feature to notice.
		They&apos;ll blend in with the bogus stats.
		If you&apos;re paying attention though, the ordering matters.
		All indexes below <code>30</code> are real, while all indexes above <code>29</code> are just filler.
