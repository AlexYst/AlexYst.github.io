<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 65 grams of cereal and 105 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had 207 grams of muffuletta.
		I planned to have muffuletta for dinner too, but ended up having 325 grams of snack mix and skipping dinner.
		At least that snack mix is gone though.
		It really wasn&apos;t enjoyable.

<section id="work">
	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		We had a dog run into the restaurant through the back door today, which was really odd.
		I didn&apos;t one of the other shift leaders led the dog out, and I later learned they were trying to find the owner.
		They found the owner in the second-hand shop next door, where the dog apparently ran over to the owner and rolled over at their feet.
		Once the dog was returned, the shift leader came back and explained what had happened.
		The owner&apos;s car&apos;s window was broken, so the dog jumped out while they were shopping.
		Out behind the store, the dog nearly got run over by a truck, then it ran into our building.
		Maybe it was trying to get away from the car, but probably not.
		It was probably just curious as to what was in here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today didn&apos;t go well, and we ended up behind schedule.
		First of all, I&apos;m not used to working morning shifts, so I had little idea what I was doing.
		Then I messed up and made the wrong pizzas, so while we&apos;d use those eventually, it wasted time for the time being, because I then had to make the right ones.
		After that, we had the dog incident, leading to loss of that shift leader&apos;s time.
		Meanwhile, it seems the dough maker didn&apos;t know what they were supposed to be doing, and made a bunch of extra dough that we didn&apos;t need, wasting their own time as well.
		Again, we&apos;ll use that dough, but it helped put us behind schedule for today.
	</p>

<section id="locales">
	<h2>Locales</h2>
	<p>
		Setting locales temporarily via shell variable was failing before, but now it works just fine.
		I&apos;d compiled locales previously, but I&apos;m guessing they don&apos;t work until a system restart has been performed or something?
		Anyway, now that I&apos;ve restarted the system, setting <var>LC_TIME</var> doesn&apos;t generate any error messages.
	</p>
	<p>
		I finally learned a user-specific way to set locales, too.
		There&apos;s no squid-damn reason why this has to be done on a system-wide basis, and there&apos;s no squid-damn reason why a user should need root access just to set the format that times and dates are displayed in.
		But without any instructions on how to set locales on per-user basis, I&apos;ve had to set the system-wide locales, which means modifying system configuration files, which very much should and does require root access.
		<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Locale">It seems you can set a user&apos;s locale by creating and modifying a file at <code>~/.config/locale.conf</code>.</a>
		This information comes courtesy of the Arch Linux Wiki.
		I&apos;m not on Arch Linux, of course, but I feel like there&apos;s no good reason this shouldn&apos;t apply to Debian and PureOS as well.
		I&apos;ve yet to actually test this yet though.

	<p>
		I&apos;m simplifying the mechanics of the mod I&apos;m working on.
		The banks won&apos;t allow you to craft anything new, and they only store the element that you mined or farmed to get them.
		The exception to this is the sand banks, which act as wildcards.
		Because sand doesn&apos;t need to be stored in large quantities if you&apos;re using it to get more sand banks, each sand bank will instead be able to store any one type of item of your choosing.
		Want to store something you have too much of such as cobble?
		Go for it.
		Want to store some crop you&apos;ve got such as papyrus?
		Great.
		Want to store crafted items such as locked chests?
		You can do that too.
		Each sand bank can store a massive quantity of an item, but only one type of item.
		You can always empty it and choose another item thoguh.
