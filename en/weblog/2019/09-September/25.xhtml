	<h2>Swimming lessons</h2>
	<p>
		My workmate wrote to me this morning, cancelling on me.
		That was disappointing.
		I&apos;d spent about an hour getting ready, too.
		Maybe some other time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I should have gone on my own after that, but I wasn&apos;t feeling up to it.
		I sort of messed up the back of my throat yesterday, and didn&apos;t really want to go if I was going alone.
		I was having vinegar cravings, and I drank some a bit too quickly.
	</p>

<section id="jockstraps">
	<h2>Jockstraps</h2>
	<p>
		With no swimming lessons, I went out to get more jockstraps as I&apos;d planned to do before.
		I planned to get six of them, so altogether, I&apos;d have a week&apos;s worth.
		I changed my mind though.
		As I won&apos;t be putting these directly on my skin any more, they won&apos;t be absorbing my sweat, so I don&apos;t really need a separate one each day.
		It&apos;s be nice to have more than just the one though, for things such as swimming, so I have a dry one after I get out of the pool.
		I decided to get two.
		With three, I&apos;d have one for in and out of the pool, and a third just in case I need another for some unexpected reason I can&apos;t currently think of.
	</p>
	<p>
		I headed to a sporting goods store at the mall hoping they&apos;d carry them.
		They didn&apos;t have the small ones I was after though; only medium and large.
		I got a pair of the medium ones, but they&apos;re not as tight as I would like.
		With some adjusting, I think I&apos;ve figured out how to make them work, but I haven&apos;t worn them outside the apartment, so maybe not.
		It this doesn&apos;t work, I can try sewing the straps in a bit to make them tighter.
		That might work.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/25.png" alt="A temporary tree farm" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I spent a lot of time grinding today, and found some of my needles were disappearing on me.
		I ended up checking the <code>liblevelup</code> database to compare to what I was seeing in-game.
		Were drops being counted but not added to my inventory?
		Or were they disappearing before they could be counted?
		Instead, what I found was that <strong>*nothing*</strong> was being counted.
		I&apos;d bugged up <code>liblevelup</code> and somehow not noticed.
		All the grinding, snow-farming, and sand-digging I&apos;ve been doing had been for nothing, as I&apos;ve got to start over the world.
		Lovely.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I went to the code, I quickly found how I&apos;d missed the problem while debugging.
		<code>liblevelup</code> has two counting modes: limited mode and unlimited mode.
		Limited mode has an integer overflow problem, but is faster to run.
		Unlimited mode was new though, so that&apos;s what I was testing.
		Limited mode is the default, because honestly, I think the overflow point is far higher than players will reach.
		In the new world, I never set the counting mode to unlimited.
		Partly, I&apos;d forgotten to at first, but I left it that way once I remembered so I could test the overflow point.
		I grind a lot.
		If not even I can reach the overflow point, the limited implementation is good enough.
		But if I can, I should consider removing the limited implementation and only using the unlimited one.
		Anyway, the limited implementation was reading the current value from the database, the writing back that same value without actually incrementing it.
		It&apos;s a good thing I haven&apos;t released this version of <code>liblevelup</code> yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		This time, I think I&apos;m going to try to avoid biting off more than I can chew with the landscaping.
		Last time, I cleared away all the sand, leaving bare stone, and felt like I couldn&apos;t really move on until I&apos;d finished farming all the snow I&apos;d need to cover it.
		I wanted to go mining, but wasn&apos;t able to see where the mine should go until I&apos;d gotten the basic foundation of the island set up.
		This time, I&apos;ll only clear sand out as I get the snow to replace it with.
		I&apos;ll put the mine off to one of the sides, and build a storage room around the entrance.
		I&apos;m also going to go with a larger bridge than last time, more similar to the time before.
		The narrow bridge just doesn&apos;t speak of grandeur.
		The offshoot bridges can be small and quaint, but I&apos;d like the main roads to be at least a little epic.
		I&apos;ll go with the single-track setup for the rails though.
		Having two rails looks better than having one, but it means that if you&apos;re on the wrong rail, you have to stop, pick up your cart, and switch to the other rail at your exit.
		Or just dismount entirely, but earlier than you otherwise would have to.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve left all the dirt where I found it, took away the snow and the naturally-generated trees, and replanted the trees and snow in a way that makes better use of the dirt patch.
		That&apos;ll keep the snow and logs coming until I get the actual tree farm area filled in with snow.
