<section id="scale">
	<h2>Scale</h2>
	<p>
		I picked up the scale today.
		I examined it a bit, and sure enough, there&apos;s a unit switch on the back, flipping it between kilograms and pounds.
		Most of the time, the scale gives me an unhelpful error message: &quot;Err&quot;.
		I can get it working sometimes though.
		I&apos;ve yet to find the pattern, but as I experiment with it, I should figure out what it&apos;s after.
	</p>

<section id="laser">
	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		I nearly forgot to get my home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment done today.
		I&apos;m so far behind that days are really blurring together for me, and I&apos;m not remembering what I need to get done.
		I did manage to get it done before work though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="email">
	<h2>Email notifications</h2>
	<p>
		I tried to get push email set up on my laptop, but that didn&apos;t seem to work.
		It works for a few minutes, while I&apos;m sending myself an email to test the setup, but the client soon stops receiving the new emails.
		My best guess is that it&apos;s happening when <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> automatically switches exit nodes.
		It might interfere with the push email functionality.
		Perhaps the server is trying to send notification to the old exit node, and this isn&apos;t just some connection from the client that&apos;s kept alive for the server to communicate notifications on.
		I don&apos;t know.
		I don&apos;t know how push email works.
		Anyway, I&apos;ve set the client to also manually check for email every five minutes now.
		That, it seems to be able to do and do correctly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, I tried setting up notification sounds for when email comes in.
		The client had two options: use the system&apos;s email notification sound or choose a sound file to play.
		The system&apos;s sound is incredibly short and quiet.
		I&apos;ll never notice it if I&apos;m not sitting at my computer when the email comes in.
		That&apos;s not going to work for my boss.
		The only sound files I have though are music files.
		I&apos;ve set Kellee Maize&apos;s Third Eye as the notification sound for now.
		This certainly gets my attention.
		It has a major drawback though: I can&apos;t dismiss the notification sound once I notice it.
		I have to wait out the entire song or close the client and reopen it.
		It&apos;s a great song, but it&apos;s obnoxious to have music going while I&apos;m trying to work or trying to focus.
		It&apos;d be nice if the client had a way to dismiss notifications, but then again, it&apos;s Thunderbird, and Thunderbird&apos;s been a screwy client for as long as I can remember.
		It won&apos;t even let me set the date format for email send times, for Squid&apos;s sake.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2019/09/21.png" alt="The narrowed bridge" class="framed-centred-image" width="1033" height="600"/>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten the bridge narrowed and its support pillars repositioned.
		This separates the support pillars from the dam, and while I was getting that fixed, I noticed that I&apos;d built the dam a bit incorrectly.
		I&apos;d intended to top it with a horizontal log, and never did.
		I guess I just spaced that.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the bridge narrowed, it gives me one node more space on the side of the tree farm, which is the last little bit I needed to get an extra row of trees in.
		That row only gets two trees because it&apos;s on the coast, and the shape of the coastline cuts that row short, but still, that&apos;s two more trees I can add.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="swimming">
	<h2>Swimming lessons</h2>
	<p>
		My workmate who&apos;s teaching me to swim asked if I&apos;d mind if they invited their partner along this time.
		Apparently, their partner felt left out last time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course I don&apos;t mind.
		My only real concern is that I&apos;d be meeting someone new without having first gotten my voice fixed as I&apos;m wanting to do before meeting new people.
		They&apos;ve clearly heard about me from my workmate though.
		Their first impression of me has already happened.
		My workmate seems to accept me for the most part though, and makes an honest effort not to hurt me.
		There&apos;s a good chance their partner will behave similarly, and I&apos;m interested to meet them.
	</p>
	<p>
		But also, I think it&apos;s good for people to want to be involved in what their partners are doing.
		I think it makes for a healthier relationship.
		I say that, but I&apos;ve never been in a relationship, so I guess I don&apos;t have a leg to stand on with that.
		Still, I think it&apos;s a good thing that they&apos;re wanting to hang out with my workmate, even if it&apos;s not alone time together.
		Furthermore, there might be more to this.
		They might just want to go swimming with us.
		However, they might also be assessing the situation.
		Maybe they want to meet the people their partner spends time with.
		Or maybe they want to make sure I&apos;m not trying to steal their partner or something.
		Seriously, I&apos;m <strong>*so*</strong> uninterested.
		First of all, if you&apos;re taken, I don&apos;t want you.
		Either you&apos;d never dump your partner for me or you&apos;d dump me for the next partner just as easily.
		But also, they&apos;re too young for me and they&apos;re into marijuana and cigarettes.
		The drugs you&apos;re on are your own problem if we&apos;re not together, but if we&apos;re together, they become my problem too.
		I just don&apos;t want that in my life or in my home.
		If they see how I interact with my workmate though, that should put to rest any fears they might (but probably don&apos;t) have.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe I&apos;m overthinking this (I always overthink nearly everything), but both my instincts and my logical side say that their partner being interested in coming along is a favourable turn of events, and should be welcomed with open arms.
