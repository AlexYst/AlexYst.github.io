	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		I stayed up late last night past midnight trying to catch up on my journal entries for the past several days.
		So much has been going on that I&apos;ve only been able to take some short notes on what I&apos;ve been doing, and not actually write out my full entries.
		Before I finally went to bed, I drank 312 grams of soy milk.
		In the morning, for breakfast, I had 70 grams of cereal and 49 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had 238 grams of muffuletta and 36 potato nuggets.
		I didn&apos;t have much of a dinner, but I had 36 more potato nuggets after work as sort of a mini dinner.

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I woke up this morning to find an email from my academic advisor once again claiming I hadn&apos;t paid my tuition.
		The term starts tomorrow!
		I had no time to lose.
		Before I left to pay the credit union another visit, I got an email from one of the shift leaders asking me to come in early to cover the shift of someone that couldn&apos;t make it.
		Yeah.
		No.
		That wasn&apos;t happening today.
		I informed the shift leader of the situation with the school, and that they&apos;d need to find someone else to cover the shift.
	</p>
	<p>
		I sat down with a representative at the credit union to try to sort this all out.
		My understanding is that they purpose of cashier&apos;s cheques are to protect both parties.
		The sender can&apos;t claim to have sent cash but never sent anything, and they can&apos;t try going to court claiming to have given the cash in person, et cetera.
		At the same time, the receiver can&apos;t access the money without leaving proof that they&apos;d received the money, so they can&apos;t lie and try to double-bill, as the school seemed to be doing, whether intentionally or not.
		The other representative had given me proof that the school had cashed the tuition cheque, and yet the school was rejecting that proof and claiming I hadn&apos;t even paid at all.
		Surely, if the receiving party was trying to lie and claim not to have received the money, there would be some action that could be taken, right?
		So my goal today was to find out what that action was and get the school to finally accept the fact that they did have the money.
	</p>
	<p>
		The representative I dealt with today tried to find a telephone number to call the school, thinking they could resolve the problem if they could just speak to the billing department.
		They couldn&apos;t find a number though.
		Oddly, the school doesn&apos;t seem to have one publicly listed.
		That&apos;s fine though.
		Telephone calls are almost never the answer to anything.
		They then telephoned another department of the credit union, who also didn&apos;t have any information.
		Telephone calls sure are helpful, aren&apos;t they?
		One thing they pointed out to the person on the other end though was that the cheque wasn&apos;t endorsed.
		I&apos;d noticed that too in the scan of the cashed cheque the other representative had given me.
		It was very odd, and I was glad to see I wasn&apos;t the only one that thought so.
		There was also no information on which financial institution the cheque had been cashed through, which was exceedingly odd.
		I asked if maybe the cheque had been intercepted in the mail and been cashed by the wrong party, the the representative said that cheques don&apos;t work that way.
		I mean, I thought that some sort of security would prevent this, but then again, <strong>*something*</strong> had obviously gone wrong.
		It was my strong assumption that they problem was entirely that the school had cashed the cheque as the credit union had said they did, but that they were terrible at bookkeeping, and hadn&apos;t properly put the money toward the tuition bill.
		However, I was starting to get the feeling that something entirely different had occurred, given the odd circumstances that seemed to surround this cheque.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ending the telephone call, the representative said that the person on the other side was going to do more research into this cheque, while they would do research too from our end.
		This was where things got really weird.
		They managed to find the institution that had cashed the cheque: it was themselves.
		The representative found a strange $200 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> deposit on my account.
		Had I accidentally deposited the cashier&apos;s cheque instead of my pay cheque?
		No, that wasn&apos;t it.
		I always sign the cheques I deposit, and this one was unsigned.
		I said that it might have been possible that I&apos;d accidentally left eh cheque on the counter or something, but they said that their protocol was to try to contact the member before doing anything such as depositing it back into the account.
		And they said when a cashier&apos;s cheque is put back into the account of the member that withdraws it, the employee doing the deposit is supposed to leave a note on the cheque&apos;s history as to what happened.
		After further research, the representative noticed that I&apos;d come into deposit the pay cheque the very next day.
		Clearly, I hadn&apos;t done that.
		But clearly, the money from the tuition cheque had somehow found its way back into my account.
		It was no wonder the school claimed not to have the money themselves!
		At this point, the representative started phrasing things as if they knew that the deposit had been from the cheque after we&apos;d covered the fact that I hadn&apos;t done this, but they never said they actually found evidence of this.
		I agreed that the money was from the cheque, but this was still speculative, as far as I could tell.
		It was a bit off-putting that they were speaking as if it were certain without having actually mentioned having found verification of this.
		That wasn&apos;t done, which made it seem like maybe they hadn&apos;t done it.
		But then they tracked down which employee had made the deposit.
		At that point, we had certainty.
		They were with another member at the moment, but they promised to talk to the other representative and try to find out what happened.
		It&apos;d happened about a month ago, so they weren&apos;t sure they&apos;d remember, but they&apos;d try, them email me what they found.
	</p>
	<p>
		By the time I arrived home and put things away enough to check my email, the representative had already emailed me.
		It seems the other representative took a look at the email address on my account, and when it didn&apos;t end in <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, <code>.org</code>, or some other common <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>, they just <strong>*assumed*</strong> the email address to be invalid without even trying it.
		So they didn&apos;t contact me, which was one breach of protocol, but they also didn&apos;t make proper note of what had happened on the cheque&apos;s history, which was another breach of protocol.
		Without the proper note on the history, the other representative I talked to later saw that the cheque had been cashed, and didn&apos;t realise that it hadn&apos;t been cashed by the school.
		And that caused just enough delays to prevent me form getting the replacement cheque express mailed to the school in time.
		Wow.
		What a mess.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			It seems everybody involved on this royally messed up.
			And yes, that includes me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I went back to the credit union and showed them your letter claiming not to have received my payment.
			They tried to contact the school via telephone to talk about how the cheque had already been cashed by the school, only to find that you don&apos;t have a public telephone number.
			Honestly, I don&apos;t blame you for that.
			Telephones are stupid.
			Good for you.
			I actually don&apos;t have telephone service myself, and though I think the school does have telephone service, I commend you for not only not trying to insist that people try to reach you via telephone, but also not even making telephone contact an option.
			Way too many companies try to insist that everything be done via telephone, and the fact that this school is the exact opposite is a refreshing change.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyway, after being unable to reach you other than email, which I&apos;ve already been doing, they did some more research into the cheque.
			It seems the cheque was found in the parking lot of the credit union.
			I&apos;d dropped it as I biked away, I guess.
			So what did I send the school?
			It was an empty envelope, probably.
			I failed to get my payment to you, and for that, I&apos;m very sorry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Having found the dropped cashier&apos;s cheque, a credit union representative deposited it back into my account.
			Protocol says they&apos;re supposed to leave a note on the cheque&apos;s history file explaining why the cheque was deposited back into the account it was taken from instead of put into the account of the intended recipient.
			They didn&apos;t do that.
			They left no note whatsoever, leaving everyone that read the cheque&apos;s history in the dark about what had happened.
			Protocol also says that they are supposed to email the account holder - me - when this sort of thing happens.
			They didn&apos;t.
			This breach of protocol left me in the dark as to the fact that the cheque never went out.
			And finally, the representative I spoke with last time about your claim not to have received the cheque told me that the cheque had been cashed by the recipient, when it had actually been cashed by the credit union itself to put back into my account.
			All of these mistakes left me not knowing what was going on so I couldn&apos;t get the problem fixed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The university isn&apos;t guilt-free here though.
			As I said, we *all* messed up pretty badly here.
			To start off with, you don&apos;t have any sort of account system.
			Students aren&apos;t able to pay early and have money in their accounts so problems like this don&apos;t cause financial holds and missed terms.
			Students have no way to make sure they have money to you well in advance.
			Secondly, you give students such a small window to pay in.
			Like you informed me previously, you don&apos;t allow payments until six weeks into the term.
			If you allowed payment at the beginning of the term, there would be over a month more time to deal with technical problems such as these.
			This would be a much more reasonable payment window.
			We would have been able to find the problem and get it corrected in time.
			Additionally, you cancelled my registration on me.
			I have a two-year history of paying my tuition.
			You *know* I&apos;m not trying to short you.
			You could have worked with me and allowed this one payment to be a bit late.
			You can say that &quot;that&apos;s just your policy&quot;, but that&apos;s not an excuse at all.
			Rather, it&apos;s proof of the problem.
			The fact that that even *is* your policy shows that you&apos;re not willing to work with students through technical difficulties such as these and instead would rather prevent us from making progress in our education shows that you don&apos;t actually care about your students.
			Of course, I really shouldn&apos;t be surprised.
			I&apos;ve seen this same, uncaring attitude from the school pretty much every time I&apos;ve tried to get you to deal with something of any importance.
			The school&apos;s name makes the claim that this place is &quot;of the people&quot;, it doesn&apos;t really seem like it is.
			That name really seems to be a lie, doesn&apos;t it?
			That name really doesn&apos;t fit this place&apos;s attitude at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			And finally, there&apos;s you yourself, <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>.
			You always take about a week or more to respond to my emails on these types of *TIME SENSITIVE* issues.
			Last time, when there was a technical problem on the school&apos;s end preventing me from registering for courses, which I wrote to you on the very first day of early registration, you waited until the *VERY LAST DAY OF LATE REGISTRATION* to get back to me.
			The courses I needed were already full by that point, and I had to register for different courses.
			And to top it off, the courses available were proctored, so I had to get my proctor to accept my request that they proctor me via your online confirmation system in only a few hours, as they were going to close soon.
			If they hadn&apos;t been so very fast to respond - if they&apos;d made me wait even a single day - there wouldn&apos;t have been time and you would have cost me getting to attend school at all that term.
			And now this term, you *DID* cost me getting to attend for the term.
			Your aggravatingly-slow responses have made it impossible to get the problem solved in time to get the issue cleared up.
			The term starts tomorrow, and we&apos;re only now learning what went wrong with the payment.
			I registered on the first day of early registration, but now late registration has come and gone due to your slowness to respond.
			It really shows how little you and the school care about us students.
			I&apos;m now stuck sitting on my hands this term, unable to progress in my studies.
			I&apos;m stuck here at this school that drains the vitality and joy of life out of me for three extra months now.
			*YOU* cost me this term.
			*YOU* have cost me three months of my life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyway, your reissued cheque is in the mail.
			I didn&apos;t bother to express mail it, because even if it arrived tomorrow, I don&apos;t think you&apos;d actually give me back my time by getting me into courses for the coming term.
			Late registration has come and gone, and it&apos;s probably &quot;not your policy&quot; to make an exception here.
			With that in mind, it really only needs to arrive some time in the next three months, and regular postal speed can more than get it there on time with that sort of deadline.

		I&apos;m far too drained to say much more about this.
		The section before the letter sums up how the day itself went, and the letter explains what the situation turned out to be once I had all the pieces of the puzzle and how I feel about how things played out.
		I&apos;m incredibly frustrated that I turned out to be the cause of the issue though.
		I mean, everyone involved had a hand in making the situation worse, but in the end, it was my initial losing of the cheque that was the root of all the trouble.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		There&apos;s too much stress going on in my life, and I&apos;m getting nowhere on this project.
		I can&apos;t deal with this project as-is any more.
		It&apos;s just going to drag on and on, continuing to go nowhere, and in my emotionally-drained state, I can&apos;t continue this project at all unless some major changes are made.
		The project&apos;s goals need to be completely scrapped and re-chosen.
		I tried to make this mod into something other people would find fun.
		I tried to make great use of palettes.
		I tried to have this mod get people to see the value of <code>liblevelup</code>.
		But I don&apos;t actually care about any of that, when it comes to the gameplay in my own, private world.
		Here&apos;s what I care about.
		I care about grinding my stats, even if those stats do nothing.
		I care about not throwing out perfectly good materials even if they&apos;re completely useless to me.
		I care about not dedicating huge amounts of storage space for those useless items.
		And I care about having some target to work toward.
	</p>
	<p>
		So here&apos;s the new plan.
		I&apos;m going to build one dedicated node for each element.
		No palette indexes will be used.
		The mod won&apos;t hook into <code>liblevelup</code> in any way.
		At all.
		The nodes will each stack up to 65535, the maximum amount the engine can handle having in a stack at once.
		And finally, acquiring one of these nodes will require the player - me - to fill their inventory - both their crafting grid and their main inventory slots - with full stacks of the element.
		This will trigger the craft preview slot to display one of the item, and if the player takes that item, their entire inventory gets cleared.
		They then have that one item, and only that one item.
		That makes them purely trophy nodes that the player can optionally work toward, better than the PB&amp;J Pups that were removed from the game, as having one of those pretty much only proved you had luck on your side.
		You could search for one for months, I suppose, but in the end, you just whacked the random number generator enough times - that is, with enough patience - to finally get your desired outcome.
		No amount of luck will instantly get you one of these nodes, even with the best of luck.
		Everyone has to earn them, or they don&apos;t get them.
		But in the end, having one is the only reward.
		They don&apos;t do anything further for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		The beauty of this plan is that if I actually put any effort in whatsoever, I can&apos;t fail to produce the mod I&apos;ve described.
		It&apos;d be nice to get fancy with meshes for these nodes, but that&apos;s not actually one of the goals of the mod, so I can fall back to plain cubes if I have to.
		As for the rest, it&apos;s absolutely doable.
		I know for a fact that it is.
		I know enough about the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> to make the weird your-entire-inventory-just-got-used-as-crafting-material thing work, and just to be sure, I even double-checked the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> documentation to be sure I had remembered correctly.
		I had.
		There should be almost no challenge to creating a basic form of this mod, and from there, I can make the nodes more interesting later.
		Mostly, I&apos;ll probably work on their appearances, though I do have a few minor features I might implement, such as maybe having plantables instantly grow to their full form if planted within some distance of the related trophy node.
