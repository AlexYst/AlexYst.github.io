<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was at work, and the head manager wasn&apos;t on duty.
		For some reason, we were swapping out the keys needed for various things, such as to get into the registers.
		One of the shift leaders told the others to each grab one of the new keys.
		I was going to grab one, but then I decided I&apos;d better not.
		Unlike the full shift leaders, I didn&apos;t have a previous set of keys.
		I should wait until the head manager actually gave me keys.
		But then, the shift leader specifically handed me keys, so I figured I couldn&apos;t get in trouble for taking them.
		I ended up with three very odd-shaped keys, and I knew one of them went to the card reader (why was there a key to the card reader?), but I wasn&apos;t sure what the other keys actually went to.

<section id="diet">
	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had 51 grams of cereal and 105 grams of soy milk.
		For lunch, I had 271 grams of muffuletta and 24 potato nuggets.
		There wasn&apos;t time to make anything for dinner, so I took to work with me a 411-gram can of sliced pears to eat.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="promotion">
	<h2>A promotion?</h2>
	<p>
		I took the manager test today.
		Or I started to, anyway.
		I hadn&apos;t been taught some of the answers, so I got stuck.
		Yesterday, the head manager said to tell them if I didn&apos;t know some of the answers though, so that&apos;s what I did.
		When I got to work later, I asked the head manager about unknown answers.
		Other shift leaders keep telling me the test is scary but not to worry, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve shown any signs of fear or nervousness.
		And now, I&apos;ve seen the test and been given the remaining answers.
		But a shift leader again told me the test is scary but not to fear it.
		I&apos;m not scared.
		I&apos;m mostly apathetic about it.
		Even if I don&apos;t get the promotion, I&apos;ll be just fine.
		It is a little surreal though.
		It feels a bit odd, not being the one that&apos;s supposed to strictly follow orders, but instead one that&apos;s also supposed to give orders and one the new recruits look to with their questions.
		I mean, I&apos;ve always helped the everyone out, including the new people, but now, it seems like they look to me even more.
		Of course, that could also be because half the crew is new now, so with an unusually-high number of people just getting started, everyone&apos;s being asked more questions by new recruits than before.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tonight, I learned how to fill out the job position whiteboard.
		First, you take the four employees scheduled to stay the latest, and you place one at each of the four major stations of the store: the drive-through, the front counter, and both sides of the ovens.
		From there, you fill in the gaps - including both taking care of minor stations and getting help for the main people at the main stations - by placing the other employees.
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager asked if I wanted to work the drive-through or landing tonight.
		I never want to work drive when they&apos;re on duty.
		They make drive-though much more stressful than it needs to be.
		They ten offered me one of two landing partners.
		I could take the one nearly everyone finds obnoxious but that I don&apos;t actually mind, or i could take one of the new recruits.
		At first, I didn&apos;t care which, but then I remembered that the one people find obnoxious tends to be insubordinate, and that I was going to be expected to keep landing under my own control, as I&apos;m expected to behave as a manager now.
		I&apos;ll be more comfortable working with the insubordinate one once I&apos;ve had more management experience and am better able to assert that the instructions I give are to be followed, but for tonight, I went with the new recruit.
		We didn&apos;t really talk much aside from to keep on the same page and get the job done, probably mostly because I&apos;m too stressed out with everything that&apos;s going on to be very talkative for the time being, but this employee always seemed drawn to the exact tasks the head manager is always telling me to make whoever I&apos;m working with do.
		For some reason, the head manager wants me landing certain types of items and delegating certain other types of items, but because of what this employee always chose to do, I don&apos;t think I gave a single instruction to keep things going the way the head manager wanted them to go.
		It was pretty much the exact opposite of working with the insubordinate employee, where I had to keep giving the same instructions repeatedly and still not getting them to stick with the tasks I&apos;d asked them to perform.
		It was a pretty relaxing shift in that regard.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I came up with a better idea, making better use of the palette.
		The level gains in each elemental affinity will provide mana.
		Mana is a finite resource, so you can only get so much of it.
		Each of the nodes my mod will add, which are crafted from one of more mana, can only be used by the creator to prevent players from simply creating bogus accounts and getting easy and infinite mana.
		There will be 256 types of each node, and one node for each element.
		I&apos;ll need to come up with 6656 unique node abilities for initial 0.0 release and 1024 more abilities for 0.1 release.
		1536 of the 0.0 nodes will be unable to be acquired normally, and will be an Easter egg for when server owners install a mod similar to the retrostats modpack, though that modpack will remain unreleased until someone notices the code that adds those hidden nodes.
		I calculated that all one-, two-, and three-element combinations should produce stable results, and some four-elements combinations should as well, though no other combinations should work
		This will limit what I need to think up, but will still take a lot of thinking and planning.
		There will still be so many effects I need to come up with.
		Maybe I&apos;l start with four nodes; 1024 possibilities.
		Or maybe even just one node; 256 possibilities.
