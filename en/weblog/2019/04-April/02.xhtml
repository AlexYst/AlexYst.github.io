	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		The <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair removal place was open today, so I tried dropping by again.
		At first, I got mistaken as the first patient of the day, but that was cleared up easily enough.
	</p>
	<p>
		I asked about the price listed online, and as expected, it was per treatment, not for the full regiment.
		What I didn&apos;t expect is that it was per &quot;area&quot;.
		The doctor mentioned three of four &quot;areas&quot; on my face, and that didn&apos;t even cover everything.
		Getting it all done would cost way more than the one hundred dollars quoted online.
		However, they have a full face option that they said is two hundred dollars per treatment.
		They wouldn&apos;t estimate the number of treatments needed, saying that the guesses don&apos;t always pan out.
		Thy treated someone with very light heir once, for example, and thought it would take tonnes of appointments to get rid of it.
		Instead, it surprisingly only took two treatments.
		They did say the average is six to eight treatments though.
		If it took ten appointments, it&apos;d cost the same as the other place estimated, so it looks like this place is the less-expensive option.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turns out the doctor here knew about the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment offered by the first clinic I tried at.
		Their website is outdated, but that&apos;s a service they did used to provide.
		The doctor was unsure why they&apos;d stopped, and even added that the place even used to have top-of-the-line equipment for the job.
	</p>
	<p>
		They actually had an open appointment slot for <strong>*tomorrow*</strong>, too.
		Tomorrow&apos;s going to be a really busy day.
		First, I&apos;ll head into this appointment, then afterwards, rush home and try to finish my report on it before the missionaries arrive.
		And once they leave, I&apos;ll need to hurry and try to finish my report on that before I head into work.
		At least this will finally get started though.
		My next step, of course, is finding a vocal coach to help me with my overly-masculine voice.
