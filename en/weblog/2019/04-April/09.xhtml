<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed Vanessa was writing a book of curses called the Book of Honodoo.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="cheque">
	<h2>Lost pay cheque</h2>
	<p>
		Today was supposed to mostly spent the day not doing anything of consequence.
		It&apos;s something I just needed to do to try to recover from a long twelve days of constant errand-running.
		I think I deserved the break, and even if I didn&apos;t, I couldn&apos;t continue to function without it.
		Not with school starting tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, I decided to run a few light errands.
		I&apos;d been given three large bags of bottles, and when I&apos;d tried to bike one in yesterday, I found I couldn&apos;t.
		I quickly had to dismount.
		I had to walk the bike and walk the bottles.
		So this time, I&apos;d travel without the bike, which would allow me to carry both remaining bags.
		I&apos;d have to walk back, but I wouldn&apos;t need to take two half trips there on foot and two half trips back by bike.
		I&apos;d only have the one full trip on foot.
		Overall, it&apos;d be easier.
		While I was in the area, I&apos;d also check the weekly Tuesday drawing and deposit my pay cheque.
	</p>
	<p>
		After depositing the bottles, but before checking the drawing, I stopped for a bite to eat.
		Then after checking the drawing, I headed to the nearby grocery store before heading to the credit union.
		It was at the credit union that I discovered I&apos;d dropped my pay cheque somewhere!
		I assumed it was at the grocery store, so I checked the lost and found there.
		Then the one at the store with the drawing.
		Then at the restaurant.
		Then at the bottle-redemption centre.
		And finally, I headed back to the credit union just to be sure I hadn&apos;t somehow missed it having dropped there.
		I hadn&apos;t.
		Nearly the entire day was wasted walking around down town, and to top it off, my pay cheque is missing.
		My feet hurt, and I don&apos;t even get the day off I so desperately need.
	</p>
	<p>
		I took a detour, and headed toward my place of employment.
		Maybe I could catch the head manager and get them to stop the cheque and reissue it.
		I can wait for the money; I don&apos;t need it right away.
		In fact, I think I&apos;m stable enough at the moment that I could do just fine without it entirely.
		But all those wasted hours working for a boss I hate in a toxic work environment, all for nothing ...
		I want the money back.
		However, the boss wasn&apos;t in today.
		If I wasn&apos;t panicking, I would have known that.
		The head manager never works on Tuesdays.
		I should know that, because <strong>*I*</strong> always work on Tuesdays.
		It&apos;s my one day at work each week that I don&apos;t have to deal with the toxic head manager, and instead deal strictly with better but lesser-ranking bosses.
		Except this week, I don&apos;t work today for whatever reason.
	</p>
	<p>
		So now, I&apos;ve got to wait until Thursday to get ahold of the boss, because that&apos;s when they get back in.
		In the mean time, someone could fake a signature on the cheque and deposit it.
		And Thursday&apos;s already going to be a rush because school will have just started and I&apos;ll need to get enough studying done to get my initial discussion post for one of the courses in that day.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="hiatus">
	<h2>Hiatus</h2>
	<p>
		Everything extracurricular is on hiatus until I get the check stopped and reissued.
		I have the time, but not the mental clarity right now while I&apos;m panicking.
		Basically, everything is postponed for the time being with the exception of coursework, my day job, and my journal; the three things that seem to be the core of my life right now.
	</p>
	<p>
		It should go without saying that this includes the study of mythology, but I&apos;ll say it here just to be extra clear.
		Scripture-reading, church attendance, and meetings with the missionaries are called off until I have word the cheque has been cancelled and will be reissued or added to the total in my next pay cheque.
		I&apos;ve let the missionaries know I won&apos;t be able to have them over until the matter is cleared up.
		Likewise, if I don&apos;t get this reassurance on Thursday, I won&apos;t be attending the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting that night.
		Aside from drown in my coursework, I&apos;m probably going to be doing a lot of zoning out.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stupid church.
		They said we should pay tithes before worrying about eliminating our debts and saving up for emergencies.
		If I was paying tithes, I wouldn&apos;t have the savings I have now that&apos;ll let me survive should this half month&apos;s pay be lost to me entirely.
		I may be panicking, but at least I have the assurity I&apos;m not going to starve and not going to be out on the street.
		I have this because I kept my expenses low by not buying too much I don&apos;t need, because I paid off my debts, and because I saved.
		Paying a full tenth of every pay cheque to the church would have drastically hindered my ability to do that.
		Admittedly, paying off my debts before I had an emergency fund was a risky move, though it allowed me to avoid the interest stacking any higher.
		But I wouldn&apos;t even <strong>*have*</strong> an emergency fund if I was paying tithes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not that I consider it to be an emergency fund.
		It&apos;s just the money I never spent.
		I try to save up most of the money I have after rent and tuition.
		I guess I don&apos;t have anything particular I&apos;m saving for.
		&quot;The future&quot;, I guess?
		I certainly didn&apos;t intend to have to dip into savings to get through any given month.
		Still, liquid money is liquid money.
		It suffices just fine as an emergency fund on the rare occasion that an emergency does come up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps I should shoot for some sort of minimum balance.
		Then, when &quot;the future&quot; comes and there&apos;s something big I intend to buy, I&apos;ll instead save up more first if the purchase would put me too close to empty.
		That way, I actually <strong>*would*</strong> have funds set aside for emergencies.
