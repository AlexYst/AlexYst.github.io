<section id="sick">
	<h2>Sick</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten sick again.
		I think it&apos;s because I&apos;ve over-exerted myself.
		I haven&apos;t left any energy for my immune system.
		It&apos;s not like I&apos;ve had a choice though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="rain">
	<h2>A light rain</h2>
	<p>
		It seems that I have my stamina back, but not my leg strength.
		I supposed it was my stamina that gave out first though, so it&apos;d be the first to get a second wind.
		With my much-reduced leg strength, I was too slow to get everything done I wanted to do today.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rain continues.
		It didn&apos;t seem to be coming down all that hard, but when I got to the bike path, I quickly noticed that the riverbank was flooded.
		Trees poked up out of the risen water.
		I crossed the bridge I always do when making my way to the university, and was quickly stopped by another biker claiming the path to be flooded.
		Down below, emergency vehicles blocked my view so I couldn&apos;t confirm it.
		The rescue team appeared to be working beside the path though, which was clearly flooded.
		I assumed they were just preventing people from getting through while they worked, and that someone unseen was in need of help beside the path.
		I wasn&apos;t going to end my errand if I could help it though.
		They were clearly distracted, so I made my way up the hill on the other side of the path.
		I&apos;d come down a bit past them, staying out of their way and out of their sight.
		I made my way to a nearby railroad track, continuing forward on foot.
		I kept looking down to see the path, and soon enough, I found it had in fact been flooded after all.
		I wasn&apos;t sure I could make it down on this side of the railroad, but I could surely make it to somewhere walkable on the other side.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got near the bridge the train takes to cross the bike path, I found a photographer with a very nice-looking camera taking photographs down the path toward where I&apos;d come from.
		That area was walkable; I didn&apos;t need to cross the tracks!
		I managed to climb most of the way down, but fell near the bottom due to the gravel on the steep slope I had to traverse, and ended up with thorns in my side and back.
		There weren&apos;t too many, but it was mildly unpleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
		I made my way to the school&apos;s voice and hearing clinic, where I found my bike lock was missing.
		The blue bike doesn&apos;t have a place I can attach the bike lock clip, so I just sort of set the lock on the handlebars.
		I figured it must have fallen off when I fell down the hill.
		Drats.
		I had no time to go back for it.
		I&apos;d need to leave my bike vulnerable for a bit while I took care of the paperwork.
		I just needed to hand it in, then get out, right?
		I leaned the bike against a bike rack in a covered parking lot.
		Very few would see it there, and most that did see it would probably assume the bike to be locked up without investigating.
		The sooner I got back, the better my chances of not having had it stolen.
	</p>
	<p>
		I handed in the paperwork, but nearly forgot to ask about that one page I hadn&apos;t filled out.
		I deliberately put that page on top so I&apos;d see it though, so after handing the paperwork off, I noticed and asked.
		They claimed I did need to fill it out, even though most of the information it requested wasn&apos;t something I could include.
		For example, it wanted two people that are authorised to pick up &quot;the child&quot;.
		What child?
		There is no child.
		I filled it out as best I could.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got back to the parking lot, I saw through the bars that the bike was still there, and I made my way back to it.
		I&apos;d planned to take a different route home, but having dropped my lock, I&apos;d need to take the route I&apos;d come by.
		Back near the bridge, I located the lock, but it was higher up the hill than I&apos;d realised.
		The lock hadn&apos;t fallen off when I&apos;d taken a tumble, but rather when I&apos;d laid the bike down to prevent a previous tumble.
		I&apos;d forgotten that the lock wasn&apos;t held on by anything substantial, and hadn&apos;t accounted for that fact while trying to safely scale down the hill.
		I climbed back up to retrieve the thing, but I really didn&apos;t feel like trying to drag the bike back up the steep, gravely hill.
		Instead, I backtracked, taking the alternate route I&apos;d originally planned to take.
		From this side of the flood, less backtracking was necessary than would have been necessary had I rerouted when I&apos;d come across the flood from the other side.
		I was also morbidly curious to see if the path on the other side was flooded too.
		And on the other side, if such a flood was in place, I&apos;d need to cross a grassy field rather than scale a gravely hill.
		dealing with a flood on the other side would be easier than dealing with the flood here.
	</p>
	<p>
		The alternate route turned out to be much further out than I&apos;d remembered.
		There was a different bridge I&apos;d need to cross, and the bridge wasn&apos;t quite where I remembered.
		This was definitely the longer route.
		Near the point in which the two routes converged, I found a dip in the path had indeed been flooded and I needed to cross the field.
		There was another path much closer than expected though, so I didn&apos;t even need to walk through the grass very far.
		I don&apos;t think the saved effort was worth the added time expenditure.
		However, sating my curiosity was definitely worth it.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="funds">
	<h2>Bottle-redemption funds</h2>
	<p>
		I stopped by the bottle-redemption centre again and had them refund me the lost credit.
		At first, I thought I&apos;d be dealing with a different employee this time, which was a relief, as I feel odd repeatedly coming back to get the funds recredited to my account.
		I mean, it&apos;s not like it&apos;s my fault.
		I didn&apos;t choose for their kiosk to be running the buggy, failure-prone operating system known as Microsoft Windows.
		But still, I feel weird having to keep coming back to get them to fix their mess.
		However, the employee didn&apos;t know what to do and had to get the boss, who turned out to be the employee that helped me last time.
		They got it cleared up, but still, it&apos;d be nice to stop losing my credits to begin with.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="prayer">
	<h2>Prayer impressions log</h2>
	<p>
		Before work, I prayed about how today was tiring, but not as tiring as recent days.
		I think my core and my mind have hit their second wind, though my legs are still weak from exhaustion.
		I then asked once more for the censorship at the school to be lifted as a sign of Elohim&apos;s or Jesus&apos; existence, and stated that a less subtle, more irrefutable sign would also be fine.
		In return, all I saw was images of the gutters of rainy streets.
	</p>
	<p>
		After work, I prayed mentioning the long day, but also how three major errands were completed in time for the coming term.
		The <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair removal and the location of the laboratory would both be relevant to me during the term that starts in two days.
		The vocal lessons wouldn&apos;t be relevant just yet, but knowing that I&apos;ve gotten the paperwork done for now and done all I can to get into the program will help keep my mind at ease.
		I then continued that I still won&apos;t do well in the coming term, just like I never do well while school is in session, due to the censorship.
		I asked again for it to be lifted, and once more promised to read two books from the scriptures per week should the censorship be dissolved.
		All I saw in return were scenes of flooded fields.
