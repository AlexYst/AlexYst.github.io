<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I came to some sort of holiday church service and ran into Summer.
		I ignored her and she ignored me.
		I&apos;m not sure why, but I brought my largest backpack, and it was as full as possible.
		With what?
		I&apos;m not sure, but it was heavy.
		It was 23:00, nearly midnight, and I wasn&apos;t quite sure whether the service was supposed to start now or in an hour.
		Nothing was happening though.
		If I knew for sure I had an hour to spare, I would have popped across the street to check out a sale.
		A family came, and each member had a strange, long pole with fire and a foam pitchfork on the end.
		I wasn&apos;t sure I wanted one, but I wanted to check them out.
		They&apos;d gotten them at this apparent sale.
	</p>
	<p>
		I must&apos;ve had my laptop on me, as I did a Web search to see if <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is required for a Mormon baptism.
		I don&apos;t think I got my answer before waking up though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="hair">
	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		I wasn&apos;t sure yesterday, but I&apos;m sure today.
		My facial hair is continuing to grow.
		Drats.
		It looks like this wave of hairs didn&apos;t get properly killed off.
		Maybe turning up the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> next time as the doctor plans to do will help.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="voice">
	<h2>Vocal lessons</h2>
	<p>
		This being the term of transition was too good to be true.
		The program runs on the university&apos;s course schedule, due to us basically being a student&apos;s or students&apos; project.
		The term at my school hasn&apos;t started yet, but the term at this school has.
		That makes it too late to get into the program until the summer term.
		I&apos;ll still be getting my hairy face fixed this term, or working on it, but the vocal training will have to wait.
	</p>
	<p>
		Apparently, this is how getting registered is supposed to go down.
		You telephone in an they ask you questions.
		When they&apos;re done, they mail you a packet to fill out, which you then mail back.
		Because I went in person, they just handed me the sheet the telephone representative would normally fill out, and when I was done with it, they simply handed me the packet to take home.
		That saved one wait on the post office.
		An when I bring the packet back myself, that&apos;ll save the other.
		Seriously, this&apos;ll be much quicker.
		Honestly, I should have filled the packet out right then and there, but I wasn&apos;t sure I&apos;d have all the information I needed.
		Besides, I hadn&apos;t expected to fill out paperwork (I really should have), so I didn&apos;t think to bring anything to take notes on.
		If I wanted to properly document the experience in my journal, I&apos;d have to take the packet home.
		On the paperwork, it said the price was usually fifty dollars per hour too, so the price I&apos;d been told by my contact was a bit too good to be true too.
		Still, it&apos;s much less expensive than it could be.
	</p>
	<p>
		There might have been time to bring the packet back today, but I wasn&apos;t expecting to bring home paperwork and wasn&apos;t prepared to transport it in the rain.
		The papers got a bit wet in one corner, and I&apos;ve had to lay them out to dry before I can even fill them out.
		I can keep them dry on the way back, but there&apos;s nothing I can do for now but wait.
		Not that waiting really changes anything.
		I can&apos;t get in until the summer term anyway.
		I guess that means the time I&apos;m saving skipping the post doesn&apos;t help this time either.
		If I&apos;d focussed on vocal lessons before hair removal, the time saved might have gotten me in on time.
		From what I noticed on the paperwork though, it seems there are more fees to worry about, and also the group sessions aren&apos;t gratis either.
		It looks like the place isn&apos;t open on weekends, so I&apos;ll need to take the paperwork back on Monday.

<section id="prayer">
	<h2>Prayer impressions log</h2>
	<p>
		All I saw in my mind after praying this morning was strange monsters with crowns forming on their heads.
		And then darkness.
		It wasn&apos;t at all relevant to my prayer.
		It was just my mind wandering as it always does.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the evening prayer, I saw fingernail clippers, then fingernails, followed by whole fingers, and finally traffic lights.
		Again, I just see all sorts of garbage images when I&apos;m not thinking about anything.
		They&apos;re never very meaningful.
