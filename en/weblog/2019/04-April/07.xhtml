	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was exploring abandoned houses with my family.
		I forget what we needed, but I noticed we needed something.
		So I ran off to get it.
		When I returned, my family was pissed off that I hadn&apos;t stayed with them.
		I was only trying to help, and I&apos;d missed out on the exploration, and somehow, I was in the wrong.
	</p>

<section id="religion">
	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the transcripts for General Conference aren&apos;t available.
		That&apos;s inconvenient.
		I&apos;ve got to watch the videos instead, which takes longer.
		It also seems the videos will take over three days to download.
		On my terrible connection, that means I probably won&apos;t be able to download them at all.
		There are just too many breaks in the connection, not to mention that I won&apos;t have a connection at all while I&apos;m at work.
		And if the connection goes down in my sleep, I won&apos;t notice for several hours, so I can&apos;t desperately attempt to get the connection back up like I always have to do.
		In any case, watching videos of General Conference isn&apos;t happening today.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="tablet">
	<h2>Tablet</h2>
	<p>
		The tablet my father gave me has been charging since before work yesterday, but it still won&apos;t power on.
		It&apos;s probably not functional, which means it can&apos;t replace my laptop at work.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="prayer">
	<h2>Prayer impressions log</h2>
	<p>
		In my morning prayer, I prayed about how there were no transcripts yet for General Conference, how yesterday was too hectic to catch the conference live, and how the videos were going to take days to download.
		I once more asked for the censorship at the school to be lifted.
		After the prayer, all I saw in my mind was blurry figures sitting at a desk.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my evening prayer, I said that I understand where Elohim is coming from in thinking that humanity is evil.
		We&apos;re terrible.
		We really are.
		But also that we&apos;re not as bad as he thinks.
		For example, thoughts aren&apos;t evil.
		Only actions are evil.
		And to say otherwise is, well, evil.
		If Elohim and Jesus actually exist, that surely didn&apos;t score me any points.
		I promised to try to turn my life around if they show me a sign of their existence by ending the censorship at the school though.
		I mean, I&apos;m by far not the most evil person on the planet, but I do have issues I need to work on.
		I&apos;m not the nicest person either.
		All I saw in response though was biscuits with butter on them, and later, syrup added.
		I was probably thinking of food because I was hungry.
		My grocery trip didn&apos;t go well, and I ended up not bringing home any bread.
		I&apos;ve got the dairy-free butter and the syrup, but nothing to put them on.
		Maybe I should make pancakes someday soon.
		To be clear though, I&apos;m far from starving.
		I think I&apos;ve still got potatoes, and I certainly have peanut butter, jelly, rice, dry beans, and quite a few canned goods.
		I&apos;m just a bit short on perishables.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="vocal">
	<h2>Voical lessons</h2>
	<p>
		I nearly forgot to fill out the paperwork to get registered for vocal lessons today.
		Truth be told, I intended to fill out the paperwork yesterday, but life had other plans, and I instead got stuck in Eugene without a working bicycle and had to walk home.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the pages got more damaged by the rain than others.
		It seems the worst damage is on informational pages that I have nothing to fill out on, so I&apos;ll just keep those when I hand in everything else.
		For example, the most damaged page is a map of where to find the clinic I picked the paperwork up at, followed by the introductory letter from the clinic.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems the sliding fee scale is indeed a thing, for those who qualify through certain financial screening procedures.
		As I said before though, I intend to just pay full price.
		I work minimum wage, but I&apos;ve been saving up, thinking this would be more expensive than it is.
		I also have less bills than most people.
		I don&apos;t have a television, so no cable bill.
		I have no outstanding loans, such as for houses and cars, so no loan bills.
		I have no car, so no vehicular insurance bill.
		I have no telephones or mobiles, do no telephone or mobile Internet bill.
		I unfortunately don&apos;t even have my own Internet connection, so no Internet connection bill.
		I&apos;ve got to pay rent, pay for electricity, pay tuition, and pay for proctors.
		Those are the only four bills I really have.
		After those, I&apos;ve got to buy food and put quarters in the washers and dryers, along with a few minor expenses.
		I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m financially well-off, but I&apos;m certainly by no means struggling or in need of financial assistance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next page talked about how the clinic helps with so many types of issues that it&apos;s likely you&apos;ll run into another patient that you know, as well as staff and service providers you know.
		I assumed it was going to talk about how you should have discretion.
		Instead, it went the opposite direction and said that the clinic does it&apos;s best to protect your information.
		I suppose that makes more sense, considering that they mentioned non-patients you might know.
		There&apos;s not really a need for discretion when it comes to them.
		I guess I didn&apos;t think about that though because I&apos;m not trying to hide my vocal lessons.
		I want a more-feminine presence, but I&apos;m still openly non-binary, so it&apos;s not like I&apos;m trying to hide the fact that I&apos;m a queer.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems they want to give appointment times over the telephone.
		That might be an issue.
		I think I can get around it by biking in and actually talking to the receptionist face-to-face, but we&apos;ll see when the time comes.
		There might be a hassle here.
		They also want at least twenty-four hour notice if I need to cancel an appointment.
		Again, they can have said notice as long as they can accept said notice in person.
		That said, I&apos;d really like to avoid cancelling any appointments if I can at all help it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fees are due at the time of the appointment.
		They don&apos;t accept payments for later sessions; you have to pay at the session you&apos;re paying for.
		They don&apos;t bill insurance, which I found strange, seeing as they ask for your insurance information on a later page.
		They do take cash though, which is how I intend to pay, along with checks and two major credit cards.
		Apparently the price of your fees will be discussed during the first appointment, so you don&apos;t know exactly what you&apos;ll pay until it&apos;s too late and you&apos;ve got to pay for at least one session.
		I&apos;m more than happy to pay whatever they want to charge for this, so it works for me, but I can see it being problematic for others.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next page requests my data of birth, along with three separate telephone numbers at which I can be reached.
		I&apos;d rather leave the date of birth field blank, as they really don&apos;t need that, but I feel like not having any telephone numbers and telling them I simply don&apos;t have telephone service (which is the truth) is already going to raise red flags on my paperwork.
		Every time I give out my date of birth, even to medical professionals, they start pestering me on my birthday, which I absolutely hate.
		So I&apos;ve got to put an incorrect date of birth so they pester me on some other day instead.
		This time, I used the day my domain was registered, but on the year that makes me look less than a year younger than I am, rather than less than a year older.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next page seems to be mostly a page for patients who are minors, though is also the page that requests insurance information.
		It asks about one&apos;s legal guardian and who is able to pick the child up from the clinic, et cetera.
		I guess I&apos;ll leave that blank for now, then ask about it tomorrow and fill it out in the clinic if necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next page is a consent form allowing the student clinicians authorisation to observe my evaluations and treatment, as well as allow video and audio to be recorded of me for evaluation and teaching purposes.
		I don&apos;t particularly <strong>*like*</strong> being recorded, but I suppose it&apos;s fine as long as they do so either anonymously or under my preferred name.
		And my preferred name has become my current legal name, so that&apos;s not going to be an issue.
		They won&apos;t even know my crippling birth name.
		Come to think of it though, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll have to flash <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> even once.
		I&apos;ll give them my legal name just because it&apos;s the name I prefer to go by, but they have no way to know that&apos;s my legal name at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next page asks what term I&apos;m registering for.
		The receptionist already told me I&apos;ve got to aim for summer term at the earliest.
		It asks if I&apos;m a returning patient, and asks for four day and time options that work for me.
		There&apos;s a comments section, so I wrote that the days and times I put were merely preferences and I&apos;ll rearange my schedule to make whatever appointment slots they have for me work.
		I tried to leave the time ranges rather large too.
		I doubt they&apos;ll need to schedule me outside my requested time ranges.
		They say the options are from 09:00 to 16:00, and I need to be to work by 16:00.
		I gave myself a couple hours to get home and get ready for work, so I said anywhere from 09:00 to 14:00 would work.
		As they wanted four options and they offer service Monday through Friday, I simply left out Tuesday and made each day a separate &quot;choice&quot;.
		It&apos;d be nice to have Tuesday off for my Tuesday errands.
		If they didn&apos;t want me to specify exactly four options though, I would have gone with Monday through Friday, 09:00 through 14:00.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next page enumerated the fees, and it looks like I&apos;ve got to go through an expensive evaluation before I can begin treatment.
		It looks like I&apos;ll have to pay $120 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		It&apos;s well within the budget I have set aside for vocal lessons, so it won&apos;t be a problem, but it is something worth noting.
		This paper also says that you need to check with your insurance provider to be sure these fees will be covered by insurance.
		They already said on the other paper that they don&apos;t take insurance though, so I&apos;m not sure what gives.
		I don&apos;t think my insurance would cover this anyway, and I&apos;m just paying out of pocket.
		Individual sessions are $50 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>, while group sessions are $16 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then next page asks whether you&apos;ll be paying the full fees or applying for reduced fees.
		As said before, I&apos;ll pay their full asking price.
	</p>
	<p>
		The next page goes over their privacy practices.
		I read over the page in full, but none of it was of any particular interest to me, aside form the part that I could allow or deny access to my information by friends and family.
		I don&apos;t care if the clinic shares information about my situation internally or shares it with the government and other people I don&apos;t know.
		There won&apos;t be anything in the sessions that&apos;s particularly identifying aside from my name.
		I don&apos;t want my mother involved in this though.
		Not that she&apos;ll even know it&apos;s going on.
		The next page was just for a signature confirming acceptance of the privacy practices.
		It&apos;s separate from the privacy practices page itself, probably by design, so the patient can keep the privacy practices page for their own records.
	</p>
	<p>
		And finally, the last page was just that map I mentioned.
		A map to a place I had to already find in order to retrieve the map.
		Helpful!
		Normally, they mail this packet out via post though, so the map would normally be of more use to the recipient.
	</p>

<section id="funds">
	<h2>Lost funds</h2>
	<p>
		At the grocery store, the computer that handles the bottle return credits crashed after withdrawing my money but before printing the credit voucher again.
		This time, I lost $8.94 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		Stupid Windows.
		This is really annoying.
		I guess I might head into the bottle redemption centre after I get back from Eugene to get the credit back.
		I&apos;m getting really tired.
		Physically, I mean, from all the errands I&apos;ve had to run in the next city over.
		Even local errands are painful at this point.
		I really didn&apos;t need this.
