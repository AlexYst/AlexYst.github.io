<section id="dreams">
	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was talking to my mother about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raynaud_syndrome">Raynaud syndrome</a>.
		I just learned about it last night, but it&apos;s something I&apos;ve experienced for years.
		Apparently, it&apos;s believed to often be hereditary, and usually shows up for the first time in teenage and young adult women.
		I was planning to ask her about it, as she hates the cold.
		She might have this too, and that might be a part of why she hates the cold.
		It&apos;s kind of uncommon, but not overly rare.
		It affects about four percent of the population.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="tired">
	<h2>No rest</h2>
	<p>
		I had so much to write about yesterday, that I ended up staying up late into the night just to make sure everything was covered.
		As a result, I woke up tired today.
		So I took it easy today.
		I biked to the nearby clinic offering <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair removal to see if they&apos;ve gotten a <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> technician yet.
		I figured the other two main leads I got yesterday could wait until Monday.
		Before I could head out though, it struck me that I had to use today to track down the location of the church the baptism is being held at.
		This wasn&apos;t optional; the baptism is tomorrow!
		This clinic is on the same street I was told the church was on, so I could check on both in one trip, but there was no way for me to check on any other leads today.
		This was the only lead that could be dealt with today.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the clinic, I found that they still don&apos;t have a <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> technician.
		Additionally, it seems they don&apos;t plan to get one until sometime next year.
		I wasn&apos;t planning on waiting on this clinic.
		If they didn&apos;t have the technician, I&apos;d try other leads.
		But if I <strong>*was*</strong> considering trying to wait, this would have dissuaded me.
		I don&apos;t have time to wait a year to even get started on the treatment if I can at all help it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the church ...
		I was told it was on the corner of President and Harlow.
		It turns out these streets don&apos;t even intersect.
		I&apos;m not sure why the missionaries thought it was at their intersection.
		I did track down the church though, so I&apos;m ready for tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got home, I figured I&apos;d rest before work and read some scriptures to continue my analysis of them.
		However, as I was shedding my outer shell, as I always do when I&apos;m at home, I noticed one of my rings was missing.
		Again!?
		I thought it was because I was carrying bottles home.
		I found them on the way, and I didn&apos;t bring my backpack, so I just carried them in my hands, which was a bit of a pain on my bike.
		At one point, I dropped a bottle.
		It just slipped out of my hands.
		I guessed that it pulled my ring off with it.
		So back out I went to retrace my path.
		I couldn&apos;t find the ring though.
		I figured someone spotted it and grabbed it.
		I couldn&apos;t blame them.
		What are the chances someone would come back for such a cheap-looking ring?
		It was made of steel, not some expensive metal, and had clearly-fake stones in it.
		One of the stones had even fallen out and been replaced by what looked like some sort of resin.
		At the same time though, the ring still looked nice, so there&apos;s a good chance they wanted to keep it.
		By the time I got home, there wasn&apos;t time for scripture-reading.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can see already this break from school&apos;s not going to be a vacation of any sort.
		I&apos;m going to be busy the whole time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thankfully, the ring turned up in my home later.
		I think I took it off, then got distracted before I could put it away or take the other ring off.
		So when I went back to take the rings off later, one was already gone and not where it should have been.
	</p>

<section id="music">
	<h2>Funny music and chiptune</h2>
	<p>
		A workmate heard a <a href="https://professorshyguy.bandcamp.com/track/cornflake-girl-feat-amanda-lepre">Cornflake Girl cover by Professor Shyguy and Amanda Lepre</a> playing from the janky mobile I use only as a music player and thought I could point them in the direction of funny music.
		I guess Cornflake Girl&apos;s kind of funny ...
		Anyway, they wanted me to make a list of funny songs their partner might like.
		The main reason I only keep <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution">CC BY</abbr> and <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr> music on my mobile is exactly this.
		Someone might hear and want something I play.
		If I had proprietary music, even if I pirated it, someone might hear and enjoy it, then pay money to the proprietary artist.
		As such, it&apos;s pretty much my duty to take the time to provide such a list.
		A bit later, they mentioned &quot;eight bit&quot; (chiptune) music.
		So I&apos;ll make a list of chiptune music as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess compiling the lists is what I&apos;ll spend tomorrow morning before the baptism doing.
		I&apos;ll go through my library and see what songs I think are at least as funny as Cornflake Girl and anything that&apos;s chiptune and look up links to any that are still available.
		Unfortunately, the live version of Love My Little Squiddy, which is hilarious, has been taken down by the artist, Marc With a C.
		Actually, there&apos;s a lot of live stuff from Marc that&apos;s hilarious, but he took almost all of it down.
		I&apos;m not sure if what remains is really any good.
		I haven&apos;t gone back and listened to that one album from him since then.
	</p>

<section id="handwriting">
	<h2>Loopy handwriting</h2>
	<p>
		My shift leader claimed their handwriting was elegant and loopy before.
		I later found this not to be the case.
		My handwriting was loopier.
		However, it seems it depends on the context.
		Their normal handwriting does indeed lack the elegance of my own.
		However, that&apos;s just when they&apos;ve got a normal amount of space to write in.
		It turns out that when they&apos;ve got a large canvas but not much to say, their handwriting is absolutely beautiful.
		I don&apos;t need to try to imitate that for now though.
		I need to continue focussing on improving my handwriting for practical situations, as that&apos;s what I actually use.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="laptop">
	<h2>Leaving my laptop</h2>
	<p>
		As I biked home, I had a sudden scare.
		I thought I left my laptop at work.
		I turned back for a few metres, but I&apos;d watched the bosses drive away.
		The store was closed, and there was no way for me to get in and retrieve the thing.
		Great.
		This was one more problem that I did <strong>*not*</strong> have time to deal with.
		I&apos;d have to make a special trip in the morning to get the thing before the baptism, not to mention that I wouldn&apos;t have it tonight to finish up my journal entry.
		I&apos;d brought it with me to work on scripture-reading during my breaks.
		I wanted to save time, but it had backfired and cost me hours of my tonight and tomorrow morning.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t know why, but I desperately check my side ... and there was the laptop case.
		I&apos;d grabbed it before even putting on my backpack.
		Why did I think I&apos;d left it behind?
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I should probably start looping the laptop case&apos;s strap around one of the backpack&apos;s straps to prevent future problems.
		I doubt it&apos;ll prevent future scares, but it&apos;ll keep me from <strong>*actually*</strong> leaving my laptop at work; not that that&apos;s a likely problem to have.
