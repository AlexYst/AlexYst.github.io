	<h2>Funny music and chiptune</h2>
	<p>
		While sifting through my music looking for the requested stuff, I found some of Brad Sucks&apos; that I thought might fit the bill.
		I went to get a link though, and found he&apos;s completely redone his website.
		And what&apos;s more, he&apos;s removed all traces of the free licensing.
		He&apos;s no longer using free licensing.
		Frustratingly, I never got around to purchasing one of the three albums he had at the time, so I can no longer get a freely-licensed copy of it.
		I guess it doesn&apos;t matter too much though, as I need to take Brad off my playlist.
		I can&apos;t be advertising his work now that the only copies people can buy from him are proprietary.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t sort very thoroughly.
		It took me a few hours to compile what I did compile.
		That&apos;s all they&apos;re getting out of me for now.
		The lists I sent them were as follows:

	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<p>
		The baptism today began much like a church meeting.
		First, there was an opening hymn, then an opening prayer.
		Next, a talk was given about baptism.
		I couldn&apos;t write fast enough to catch everything, but I did catch some interesting things.
		First, baptism is the first covenant a person makes in order to get back to Elohim.
		It was also discussed that baptism represents the death and resurrection of Jesus.
		By choosing to be baptised, one is choosing to be reborn in Jesus&apos; name.
		Baptism also washes away your past sins, though not your future sins.
		Though imperfections are considered to be sins, so why are people still imperfect after baptism?
		It was said that after the baptism, one is confirmed a member of the church and given the Holy Ghost as a permanent companion.
		This I&apos;ve already learned before, but it was something noteworthy they went over.
		The purpose of the sacrament was gone over though, and I hadn&apos;t had the right information on that.
		Apparently, sacrament renews one&apos;s baptism and washes one free of sin again.
		Each week, people wash away their sins again.
		Does that mean taking the sacrament without a baptism does nothing?
		Also, for some reason, the there were two doors to the tub room: one for men and one for women.
		Why?
		They both seemed to lead the the same tub room.
		The segregated doors were beyond pointless.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turned out the person being baptised this time was a child.
		I suppose that&apos;d be the most common case.
		People raised in the church are probably more numerous than those getting converted.
		The important thing to note though was that the child was unwilling.
		They yelled and struggled even before being carried to the room with the tub.
		They didn&apos;t seem fearful, or anything like that.
		But they <strong>*really*</strong> didn&apos;t want to go through with this.
		The child was taken through the door matching their apparent gender, and the shutters to the adjacent tub room were opened.
		The room was behind glass, ostensibly to keep the water in, and a mirror slanted at about a forty-five degree angle was mounted on the ceiling, so people in the dry room could see the baptism both from the front and from above.
	</p>
	<p>
		The child fraught to escape.
		They really didn&apos;t want to do this.
		The child had been taken into the water at this point, and the baptist claimed the problem was that the water was cold.
		However, we&apos;d been told the water would be warm, so the child would be expecting warm water.
		They struggled before even getting into the room.
		If the water even was honestly cold, which I&apos;d say may or may not actually have been the case, the cold water may have increased their struggling, but it wasn&apos;t the cause of it.
		Some of the people running the event kept closing the shutters so we couldn&apos;t see, then opening them partly.
		Ostensibly, this wouldn&apos;t normally happen, and was because they didn&apos;t want to make a scene of the struggling in the tub room.
		At one point, the child even hit the glass with their fist.
		The audience only laughed at the child&apos;s unwillingness and struggles.
		Eventually, with the shutters mostly closed, they dunked the child, then closed the shutters for good.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the child was brought back to the main room, they were mostly dried off and wrapped in a blanket.
		It was explained to them that they were about to be given the Holy Ghost as a constant companion.
		It was said that they&apos;d have the Holy Ghost with them always, unless they got off-track in life, in which case they&apos;d not have the Holy Ghost, but at the same time, would still have the Holy Ghost.
		It seemed like some kind of quantum thing.
		Three elders put their hands on the head of the child and attempted to perform the confirmation, but the child continued to struggle, and kept ducking their head down, breaking contact.
		At one point, the child put the blanket over their head to prevent further contact, and the elders just went along with it.
		They weren&apos;t touching the child&apos;s head any more, but the blanket.
		I was told physical contact was mandatory, which would make it seem like this confirmation didn&apos;t count.
		Maybe the rules allow for something as small as a blanket to get between though.
		The unwilling child was then congratulated on the successful baptism, and a closing hymn and closing prayer were conducted.
	</p>
	<p>
		The prayer really struck me.
		The one praying said that we were all grateful for the &quot;choice&quot; the child made to be baptised, but the child didn&apos;t want this.
		The child had no choice in this matter.
		This wasn&apos;t what the child wanted.
		And after the ceremony was over, the baptist again said that the struggling was due to the cold water, and everyone seemed to believe this assertion.
		The child was told the water was warm though, and struggled before going anywhere near the water.
		Are they saying the child&apos;s psychic?
		And the confirmation didn&apos;t involve water at all.
		How did the cold water cause the struggling then?
	</p>
	<p>
		The baptism really hit me hard, symbolically.
		I mean, there&apos;s the symbology they want to get across, but there&apos;s a second layer too, that the rest of the audience couldn&apos;t see.
		I was probably the only one.
		Supposedly, being dunked and resurfacing symbolises the baptee&apos;s choice to be reborn in the name of Jesus.
		But if it&apos;s unwilling, it can&apos;t be a choice.
		This wasn&apos;t about the child choosing to be resurrected or accept Jesus into their heart.
		Honestly, dunking a child for a second is nothing and means nothing.
		But when you try to put symbology to it that doesn&apos;t fit, you have to see how much it doesn&apos;t fit.
		What this particular baptism represented was the fact that children are forced into the religion of their parents.
		The fact that all the adults deemed to believe the obvious lie that the water temperature was the cause of the struggling was also symbolic.
		These people believe the obvious lies the church - and religion in general - try to push.
	</p>
	<p>
		Back to the surface layer of symbolism ...
		I wonder if the reason three elders put their hands on the baptee&apos;s head has anything to do with symbolising the holy trinity.
	</p>

<section id="work">
	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		I agreed to take someone&apos;s shift at work on Wednesday.
		I really shouldn&apos;t&apos;ve.
		I&apos;ve got work of my own to do: searching for clinic that&apos;ll sell me <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment, getting ahead in scripture-reading, dealing with the <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> company, some apartment cleaning, et cetera.
		Whatever though.
		The head manager won&apos;t be in that day, so the shift won&apos;t be horrible.
		I&apos;ll help out my workmate.
	</p>
	<p>
		That same workmate started yelling at another workmate about not doing their job no matter how many times they&apos;ve been told to though.
		They weren&apos;t scraping the dough trays as thoroughly as they wanted them scraped.
		I pointed out that they were deliberately not doing their job though, even when asked.
		I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve mentioned it, but we&apos;ve started using the barcodes and scanners again.
		This workmate wasn&apos;t scanning the products out though.
		Normally, I ignore it, but the other day, they borrowed my register and helped a customer.
		If they&apos;d finalised the order, the unscanned barcodes would have been attributed to me, even though I wasn&apos;t the problem.
		With the register checked out to me, my name would show up in the system and cause unusable barcodes to be printed later, due to how broken the system is.
		Not scanning the barcodes causes the rest of us a lot of extra work for no good reason.
		They didn&apos;t finalise the order though, so I ended up running over, printing the barcodes, and scanning them into the register like my workmate was supposed to do.
		I told them in the gentle, half-joking way that I do, about the problem, and they told me they didn&apos;t like the system and weren&apos;t going to scan the barcodes.
		I dropped it.
		Later, someone else called them out on it.
		Loudly.
		So the shift leaders heard.
		They got angry and said that the person should have told them privately and not gotten them in trouble.
		But that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;d tried to do.
		And I wasn&apos;t the only one to ask them to do their job.
		Avoiding a scene wasn&apos;t effective.
		Calling them out was necessary to get the problem fixed.
		So when they got on someone else&apos;s case about not going things they&apos;re told to do, I pointed out what they do and how it isn&apos;t any better.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, when they&apos;d had time to come up with a better defence, they tried to justify it, claiming that they only had to be told once.
		Ignoring the times they&apos;ve been told before I told them though, when I told them, they told me they weren&apos;t going to do it.
		Telling them once didn&apos;t cut it.
		I pointed that out, and they claimed that they actually did start scanning them at that point.
		Of course, I had no way to know that, as they told me they wouldn&apos;t do it.
	</p>
	<p>
		A bit later, it occurred to me: someone else called them out on it <strong>*after*</strong> I&apos;d talked to them.
		There&apos;d be nothing to call them out on if they&apos;d started doing as they&apos;d been asked.
		I pointed that out as well.
		This time, they claimed that we were super busy, so they&apos;d missed a few barcodes.
		That&apos;s honestly no excuse.
		First of all, yes, it takes longer to walk to the barcode printer, but that just means the line moves a little slower.
		It&apos;s not like people are pouring through and you&apos;ve got to scramble to keep up.
		They were working the drive-through that day.
		Every-one&apos;s lined up single-file there.
		But secondly, not scanning the barcodes causes everyone else more work.
		When we&apos;re busy is when it&apos;s <strong>*especially*</strong> important to scan the barcodes.
		Otherwise, everyone <strong>*else*</strong> has to scramble to keep up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today though, as we were getting ready to close, business was just about dead.
		There was absolutely no rush.
		And they still weren&apos;t scanning the barcodes.
		Honestly, I don&apos;t care enough about the extra trouble it causes.
		The head manager has pretty much destroyed all loyalty I once had for the place.
		However, I <strong>*do*</strong> care about the lying and I <strong>*do*</strong> care about them being a hypocrite and jumping down my other workmate&apos;s throat.
