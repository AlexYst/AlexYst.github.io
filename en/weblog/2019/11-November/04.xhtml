<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		While experimenting in my development world, I was having trouble placing some chests on other chests while jumping.
		I thought my timing was just really bad, and I wrote that off.
		A bit later though, I tried to run while jumping across the water.
		It simply wasn&apos;t possible.
		It seems this ridiculous Librem strikes again.
		It can only register two key presses at once.
		What kind of cheap keyboard is this?
		I immediately thought back to the chest-placing issue, but that actually probably was just timing.
		I need to hold the jump key and the sneak key, but no third key.
		The third thing is the mouse emulation.
		For running across the water though, I need the run key, the jump key, and a directional key.
		I can run through the water or I can slowly jump across the water, but I can&apos;t quickly jump across the water without all three keys.
		I don&apos;t have the <code>fast</code> privilege in my non-testing worlds, so I hadn&apos;t noticed this keyboard shortcoming before.
		I&apos;ve noticed on this machine that keys don&apos;t register when I&apos;m typing at times.
		For example, I tend to fail to capitalise the beginnings of sentences and proper nouns, when I don&apos;t have that problem on other laptops.
		I also sometimes miss typing the first letter in a word altogether, but only when I need that word to begin in an upper-case letter.
		I thought the keys were less sensitive, but now, I&apos;m thinking that maybe I haven&apos;t yet taken my thumb off the space bar, so either shift or the letter is the third key held down, and it doesn&apos;t register.
		Wow.
		Even for basic typing - not even just for gaming - this two-key limitation is pretty stupid.
	</p>
	<p>
		I should have been done with the preparations for starting the new game world by now, but I just can&apos;t figure out how I want to handle the reset shop.
		I&apos;m torn.
		I want resets to cost over 42 chests full of items, but I also don&apos;t want a stored credit system.
		I&apos;d rather have the full cost paid at once.
		That doesn&apos;t seem possible without complicated world-searching setups that check your nearby chests because you can&apos;t hold all the junk or dedicated new nodes that store a lot more for you, so that single node can be used to generate the reset bomb.
		Either option doesn&apos;t quite sit right with me.
		I mean, there&apos;s definitely nothing wrong with the dedicated node option.
		It&apos;s just not as subtle as I&apos;d like it to be.
		As for the chest-finding option, it&apos;s subtle, but seems finicky, and difficult for players to work with.
		By the end of the day, I&apos;d decided to give up.
		I miss actually playing Minetest, and just want to get a world started again.
		I&apos;ll just start a world with no level-up advantages, I suppose.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve now brightened the textures for fertile mushrooms and glacier ice, so I can easily tell them apart from the counterparts that they drop.
		This should provide some limited use for harvested mushrooms in decoration, and also make it far quicker to tell where I can stop mining where glacier ice meets ice sheet ice when the two generate next to one another.
		I&apos;ve also surveyed my territory to see which elemental resources I&apos;ll have at my disposal.
		I can obviously get ahold of all the minerals if I dig down deep enough.
		As mentioned before, the only trees I can get to are apple and pine trees.
		The other three types of trees are out of range.
		I can also get to apple and pine bushes, but those don&apos;t offer me much that their tree counterparts don&apos;t.
		I looked for blueberry bushes this time, and found that there&apos;s some very close to my territory, there&apos;s none <strong>*in*</strong> my territory.
		For this round of the game, I won&apos;t be able to reach them, but depending on which direction I go for the next round, I might be able to.
		Top priority in choosing a direction though will be reaching jungles for jungle grass and cotton.
		Speaking of which, I won&apos;t have any cotton this round, but I will have wheat.
		Near my southern border is some grass to get wheat seeds from, which is also where the apple trees are.
		Up north, I have glaciers and ice sheets.
		The ice sheets are more of a nuisance than anything else.
		They need to be mined away because some of them cover up glaciers, but some of them don&apos;t, and it&apos;s only the glaciers that I&apos;m interested in.
		Sand ...
		Well, sand is everywhere.
		But most of it&apos;s a pain to get to.
		It&apos;s mostly underwater.
		Most of my territory is submerged, so there&apos;s a decent bit of sand, if I decide it&apos;s worth drudging the ocean for.
		And also as I mentioned before, there&apos;s no coral or dry dirt in my region.
		Mushrooms of both types are within reach though.
		I might not hunt them down right away this time, but I&apos;m going to need to get mushroom farming at some point, as I&apos;ll need four stacks of each type of spore before I&apos;m ready to move on.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m going to try to play in a somewhat organised but also mostly free-form way.
		I&apos;ll be stuck within the boundaries of what I&apos;m mapping with the Minetest Mapper.
		I&apos;ve rendered a copy of my area in a test world, and I can use that map to navigate all I like, especially because the Minetest Game team took away free access to the mini map.
		Carrying around a special item to re-enable a client feature they disabled in that same mod is just stupid, and I won&apos;t do it.
		Besides, having the full overview of the entire sector makes it easier to plan.
		I&apos;ll be having the mapper draw out my actual world too, and overlaying it on top of the base map to fill in the holes in the map to make it look more reasonable.
		My conditions for moving on are simple.
		First, I need a road leading from the centre of the sector (which is also the centre of the world, in this case) out to the edges in all four cardinal directions.
		Beside the ends of these four paths, within the area in which the sector overlaps the neighbouring sectors, I need to build a rest house.
		It can be as simple or complex as I like, but needs space for at least a chest or two.
		These chests must contain a stack of each item needed to renew as much as can be perpetually renewed from what I can get in my sector.
		For example, I can get pine saplings, so I&apos;ll need a stack of pine saplings.
		I can get water and lava, so I&apos;ll need a bucket of each to renew stone.
		I&apos;ll actually need two water buckets to renew water, but those don&apos;t stack, so I&apos;ll need two &quot;stacks&quot;.
		Dirt can&apos;t be renewed, but it&apos;s used to renew other things by growing stuff on it, so I&apos;ll need a stack of that.
		Each of the four rest stops will need all of these items.
		When I move on to the next sector, I can loot whatever I need from the rest house from the overlapping area, though a lot of that won&apos;t be needed, such as the dirt, water, and lava.
		Those are going to be available in every sector, unless I get outright terrible luck.
		And finally, before moving on, I need to feel like there&apos;s nothing more to do in the current sector.
		If I&apos;m not hurting for space, it&apos;s not time to move on yet.
		So I&apos;ll be here for the foreseeable future.
		I might even never leave, as honestly, there&apos;s a lot of space here.
	</p>
	<p>
		I mentioned the resource availability a bit ago.
		That actually only applies to if I choose the <code>v7</code> map generator.
		I&apos;m a bit torn as to which map generator to use.
		<code>valleys</code> is the only one with river water, so I might choose that.
		But then again, do I need river water?
		The fact that it&apos;s only available in this one map generator makes it a bit gimmicky, and thus less appealing.
		And unlike the <code>v7</code> generator, <code>valleys</code> has no floating islands.
		I&apos;d like to explore the floating islands at some point if I use the <code>v7</code> map generator.
		<code>v5</code> is also technically an option, though its steep ocean boundaries would make coral-hunting difficult.
		<code>carpathian</code> looks pretty sensible.
		At least as sensible as <code>v7</code>, probably, but again, without the floating islands.
		<code>singlenode</code> is obviously out, as it generates a world of only air.
		I thought <code>flat</code> was also out, as it has no beaches and thus no sand, but there are the sandstone deserts still.
		If you turn on the lakes feature, you also get water.
		I don&apos;t think it blocks access to any particular nodes, aside form the river water, as long as you have the right settings.
		Still, I don&apos;t think playing in a flat world would be much fun.
		And can coral spawn in the lakes of a <code>flat</code> world?
		Maybe.
		Probably, actually.
		Speaking of generators ruled out due to lack of coral, there&apos;s <code>v6</code> and <code>fractal</code>.
		<code>v6</code>, with its hard-coded biomes, is a total joke these days.
		It&apos;s missing a lot of stuff available to other generators.
		And <code>fractal</code>&apos;s a joke just because it&apos;s made to be one.
		It&apos;s probably just supposed to be a proof of concept or a generator to experiment with.
		Using it for serious worlds was never a good idea.
		So I guess my choices are <code>v5</code>, <code>v7</code>, <code>carpathian</code>, <code>valleys</code>, and <code>flat</code>.
		I have a fair number of options, but once I choose something, I&apos;m going to have to stick with it unless something totally game-changing is added to the engine or game and changing map generators is worth the weird anomalies it introduces to the world, such as strange, flat cliffs.
		Honestly, I&apos;ll probably go with <code>v7</code>.
		It&apos;s the default, I&apos;m indecisive, and it has floating islands if you take the time to turn them on before you begin (they&apos;re disabled by default, and once you start a world, the options you have set are locked in unless you edit the world files, which is also how you change map generators).
