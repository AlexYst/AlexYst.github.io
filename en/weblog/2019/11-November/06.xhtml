	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I did some planning in a test world, as I always do before starting a new world, and found that in 5.1.0, a firefly impedes progress at the spawn isle.
		The forest has expanded, which seems to have changed the spawn point, though it still remains on the same island.
		I&apos;m not entirely sure the spawn point actually moved though.
		I&apos;m a little disoriented because of the expanded forest.
		The expanded forest is no doubt the reason for the firefly&apos;s arrival though.
		I could kill fireflies, and it&apos;d be easy, but being a finite material, that would be a terrible idea.
		In general, there seem to be more fireflies, which is really neat - except that I can&apos;t craft a net without getting to a jungle first and there&apos;s no jungles in my territory.
		So the choices are to either leave the fireflies where they are or outright destroy them.
		Moving or storing them isn&apos;t possible.
		Butterflies would impede my progress too without a net, but I think they prefer a warmer climate.
		I haven&apos;t seen any.
		I&apos;ll either need to start in a different sector (which I&apos;d rather not do) or work around the insects and come back later (which will be a pain, but might influence my builds in interesting ways).
		I definitely need to be sure my next sector includes a jungle though if at all possible.
		Before switching sectors, I should map out the surrounding sectors.
		There&apos;s a good chance one of the adjacent four sectors will have a jungle.
		I remember that there&apos;s a jungle out to the west, but I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s close enough to reside in the adjacent sector, or if it&apos;s instead beyond that.
		To the south, the climate seems to be warmer, so there&apos;s a good chance there&apos;s a jungle there, if not to the west.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve decided to change where I put the rest houses.
		I&apos;d planned to put them near the centre of the edges of the sectors.
		I&apos;d stop on them as I crossed the boarder, likely near the main road.
		But i think a better place to put them would be in the corners.
		In the corners, four sectors intersect.
		By using the corners instead, I can make more-easily access stored materials from more sectors.

	<h2>Gender</h2>
	<p>
		The one person at work that calls me a &quot;they&quot; called me a &quot;he&quot; today, revealing what they really think of me.
		I spent the rest of the work day feeling rather depressed.
		It was a slip, but it shows they think of me as a man and have to consciously suppress their calling of me a &quot;he&quot;.
		They don&apos;t actually see me as I am, but just pretend for my sake.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve had more time to think about the tape wounds from yesterday.
		That day, I tried a new taping method that bound me tighter.
		I&apos;d been having issues of a slight bulge showing up by the end of the day sometimes, so when I noticed how I could get my initial taping tighter than I had been, I jumped at the chance.
		With a tighter bind, that would never happen again.
		And indeed, it didn&apos;t happen yesterday, when I tried it.
		I also had that <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment appointment in the morning, so I had to tuck earlier than usual, and I had a shift at work that night, so I had to hold the tuck as late as I usually do.
		All of that combined resulted in a longer, tighter tuck.
		Everything inside can take it, and even felt better in this configuration.
		But the skin dealt with more tension than usual.
		The outer layer of skin must have been being pulled away from the inner layer all day.
		In retrospect, it&apos;s no wonder I now have these oozing, blister-like wounds.
		Avoiding tape setups that chaff will take more practice.
		Avoiding tape setups that cause weeping wounds will only take learning not to overdo the tuck tightness.
		In all honesty, my previous taping only showed a slight bulge sometimes with my pants off.
		I could see it through my underwear.
		I don&apos;t think I could see it through my pants though.
		Not really.
		There was sometimes a slight lump in the fabric there, but I see that sometimes even with a perfect tuck.
		It&apos;s just the way the cloth sometimes sits, and that&apos;s just fine.
		So I need to work on my self-consciousness.
		Today&apos;s tuck was plenty comfortable, all the work day, with no issues whatsoever.
		It definitely <strong>*can*</strong> be done without injury.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also want to note the slight euphoria I feel when I squeeze my legs together and feel there&apos;s nothing there.
		Testicles are annoying.
		I was right to want to be female as a child.
		I&apos;m starting to consider actually transitioning with hormones and surgery.
		I would almost certainly not be me any more, but I&apos;ve got to die anyway.
		Ending myself sooner rather than later doesn&apos;t change much.
		But the person that takes my place, the one derived from me, might be happier than I ever could be myself.
		I need to remember though that hormones would mess with muscle mass.
		I need to be strong enough to defend myself against transphobic violence.
		Mostly, I think even considering hormones and surgery is just idle thoughts though, and I still don&apos;t think I&apos;d actually go through with it any time soon.
		It&apos;s just not what I want.
		What I want is for people to stop seeing me for my genitals - no matter what kind of genitals I have - and just see me as a human being.
		Hormones and surgery aren&apos;t going to give me that.
