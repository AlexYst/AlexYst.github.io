<section id="ID">
	<h2>Replacement <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t get to bed as early as I&apos;d hoped last night, so I didn&apos;t get up as early as I&apos;d planned.
		I woke up at about 08:00 and left the apartment at around 09:00.
		When I arrived, I found the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> not barren, but still mostly empty.
		I remembered yesterday to take a number right away, but wasn&apos;t able to get in to actually do so.
		Today, I forgot, but the information desk person was in for the first time I&apos;d ever seen, and they reminded me.
		Before I could even finish the paperwork, my number was called; I was literally the next number as soon as I&apos;d taken one.
	</p>
	<p>
		I told them about the stolen wallet and how I didn&apos;t know my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> number, which the paperwork asked for, and they said that was fine.
		I figured they looked me up by my name, but in retrospect, they probably looked me up by my Social Security number.
		I&apos;d brought my Social Security card along with my birth certificate thinking I&apos;d need them to prove my identity, so I was able to correctly fill out that field, reading the number off the card.
		I left the height and weight fields blank as well.
		I don&apos;t know or care my height, and they asked for my weight in pounds.
		before I left, I thought about updating my weight on-file, so I&apos;d looked up a converter.
		I decided to play dumb though.
		If they were going to use bogus, country-specific units instead of the global standard, it&apos;s not my job to buy into that system, and I don&apos;t actually need the weight on my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> to be accurate.
		When they asked about these fields, I told them I didn&apos;t know my height and while I knew I was a hundred kilograms, I didn&apos;t know what that was in pounds.
		Either they knew the conversion rate off-hand or their computer could take either one, because they updated it to the correct number, as verified by the calculator I&apos;d used previously.
		It seems I&apos;ve lost five pounds since then.
		That&apos;s about two kilograms.
		But that was so long ago.
		I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve <strong>*ever*</strong> updated the weight on-file, meaning that that was the weight from when I got my first <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		That means I wasn&apos;t so fat back then.
		I&apos;ve gained so much since then.
		I thought I remembered always being fat, and I guess I always was, but not as fat as I later got.
		Wow.
		Just wow.
	</p>
	<p>
		The identifying documents I&apos;d brought had been brought in vain.
		Once they looked me up in their system, they didn&apos;t even want to see my documents.
		I asked if they&apos;d pulled up a photo of my on their computer.
		They had.
		So it was like I&apos;d brought in my Oregon <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, except that I didn&apos;t actually have my Oregon <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> because it was stolen.
		Neat.
		If I hadn&apos;t remembered to bring my documents, I&apos;d be covered.
		Except that I wouldn&apos;t be, because I&apos;d probably need my Social Security number, meaning I&apos;d&apos;ve had to have remembered my Social Security card.
		They did say that they didn&apos;t need to see my documents <strong>*this time*</strong> as well, meaning that next time, they might.
		I have no way to know when they will or when they won&apos;t for sure, though I suspect it has to do with the expiration time on the e<abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> card.
		I think it might be that if the card&apos;s expired, I have to prove my identity again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of my photo on-file, they just used that for my new <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		They didn&apos;t have me re-take the photo.
		They said it was because I&apos;m over twenty-eight.
		The new <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> cost me $40 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>, not the $30 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> I thought I remembered, and I didn&apos;t even get to get that fat, ugly face off my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> for that price.
		I suppose it&apos;s fine, but that silver lining in having my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> stolen turned out not to exist after all.
		I would have loved to have my new, slimmer face on my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> instead.
		I&apos;ve still got a bit of a double chin, and my face still looks more masculine than I&apos;d like it to, but I&apos;ve shown marked improvement.
	</p>

<section id="police">
	<h2>Filing a report with the police</h2>
	<p>
		With my new temporary <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> in hand, I headed to the police department.
		There, they told me I needed &quot;proof of the charges&quot;.
		I asked them what they were after, and they wouldn&apos;t really be specific.
		They said the bank would be able to provide me with the proof though.
		So I figured I&apos;d bring them a printed list of recent charges.
		Unless I spoke with a representative at Discover, who might be able to provide something else, that was probably the only thing I could get that would be close to proving the charges had been made, and it would show the exact value of the charges, which was something else the officer had asked for.
		If they didn&apos;t accept that as the proof, they&apos;d just have to get more specific as to what they were after from me.
		Thankfully, I brought both my laptop and my <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive.
		The laptop, I&apos;d brought because I thought I&apos;d be waiting in line at the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr>, so I was going to work on stuff while I waited.
		With it though, I could log into my Discover account at the nearby local library.
		As for the <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive, I had it because I&apos;d left it in my camera case.
		I&apos;d used it to transfer a typed letter to the library computer for printing, and had put it in the camera case so I wouldn&apos;t lose it on the way home.
		I didn&apos;t lose it, but I also didn&apos;t put it away when I got back, so I&apos;ve been carrying it whenever I carry my camera.
		I could use it to transfer the list of charges to the library computer for printing as I&apos;d done with the letter.
		No need to stop at home to grab anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got to the library, and found it to be closed for another ten minutes.
		I thought I&apos;d left home later than I should have, but everything I needed to do today would have been held up at this point anyway.
		Instead of waiting ten minutes at the library to get in, I&apos;d&apos;ve waited an hour and ten minutes, had I let when I&apos;d initially planned to leave.
		So my leaving late turned out not to cost me any time after all.
		I tried to log into my Discover account from just outside the library, but the signal wasn&apos;t strong enough.
		My laptop claimed to connect to the Wi-Fi network, but it couldn&apos;t actually get any Web pages through.
		At this point, I got a bit paranoid.
		If I recall, at one point, the library used a captive portal.
		On <a href="/en/domains/bailey.local.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a>, I&apos;d accepted the terms of the portal before setting up the firewall that doesn&apos;t allow unsecured connections - such as captive portal redirects - to get through.
		I&apos;d used the library&apos;s Wi-Fi on <code>bailey</code> since, but it might have recorded my <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address.
		I was on <a href="/en/domains/taylor.xhtml"><code>taylor</code></a>, which has a different <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address.
		It&apos;s supposed to have a random one each time it connects, but with how many times I&apos;ve had to reset the thing to the base system since I set up the random <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> addresses, that&apos;s no longer in effect.
		Either way though, whether the <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address is stable or random, it&apos;s not one recognised by the portal, so no whitelist is going to let me skip the captive portal click-through.
		So was I unable to connect because of the lack of signal strength or because of captive portal idiocy?
	</p>
	<p>
		When I got in, I had the machine attempting to load the page, and it got through.
		Sweet!
		It was just a signal strength issue then.
		But I still couldn&apos;t log in.
		I found no more pages would load.
		I tried walking around the library to find somewhere with better signal strength, and the only place I could find was pretty far from any table or chairs.
		I had to hold the laptop with one hand, type with the other, and stand there in the middle of the room looking like an idiot.
		Whatever, though.
		I located the printer-friendly summary of charges, and downloaded it to a <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> for printing.
		While I was at it, I looked and saw the charges still haven&apos;t posted, so I can&apos;t yet dispute them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oddly, the <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> reader on the library&apos;s machine wouldn&apos;t start.
		Windows was claiming to be out of memory.
		I tried a couple more times with the same result, then tried opening the <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> in a Web browser, which should have required even more memory.
		However, the browser worked, and I printed the document.
		I&apos;m not sure what the problem with Windows (besides it being Windows) and/or the <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> reader was, but I now had the list of recent charges in hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the printed list of charges, I returned to the police station, and it seemed that was indeed what they were after.
		I explained that the oldest charge on the list, the one from my doctor, was legitimate.
		The other five were fraudulent though.
		They said that credit card companies don&apos;t make you pay for fraudulent charges, so I briefly explained the situation with Discover and how it sounded like there was a good chance they weren&apos;t going to reverse the charges, and I&apos;d have to pay for them.
		They asked if I live in town, asked for my name, date of birth, and address.
		They asked for a telephone number too, so I explained that I don&apos;t have telephone service, and said I could provide an email address if they wanted.
		They replied that they do everything via telephone or post, so I guess we&apos;re going the postal route then.
		They asked about any other cards that might have been in the wallet, and they asked about my stolen <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> card.
		They asked about any cash too, so I replied that there were two dimes, but that was all.
		I&apos;m pretty sure it was only twenty cents, and no more.
		They also asked if there was anything else in the wallet, so I mentioned the shopping list, but said that didn&apos;t really matter, and they didn&apos;t note it down.
		They also asked when it was lost, and what the wallet looked like.
		After writing all that down, they went to their computer, and when they returned, they gave me a case number: 19-9120.
		They said if I provided Discover with the case number, it might improve my chances of getting Discover to accept them as fraudulent and drop them.
		So that&apos;s good to know.
		I&apos;m still not sure if Discover can be reasoned with, but the more I have to back me up, the better.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I left, I remembered getting a case number before.
		This is a repeat of when I reported one of my stolen bikes.
		I grepped my journal, and found that&apos;d been over three years ago.
		It&apos;s really no wonder I hadn&apos;t remembered the process sooner.

<section id="errands">
	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		Despite leaving home later than I&apos;d intended to, I still left early enough that I had plenty of time after getting these two errands taken care of, so I stopped at home to regroup, then headed out on all the errands I&apos;d previously decided not to take care of today.
		I should have taken care of the electric bill on the way home, but didn&apos;t think of it until it was too late.
		I grabbed the bottles, and took them to the bottle-redemption centre.
		I checked the drawing, which was the one errand left I hadn&apos;t given up on previously.
		I lost, of course.
		It turns out I didn&apos;t even need my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> to deposit my pay cheque.
		Maybe I only need it for withdrawals.
		And finally, I used the temporary <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> to pay the electric bill.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="clover">
	<h2>Clover</h2>
	<p>
		Lately, I&apos;ve been watching for four-leaf clovers when I come across clover patches.
		I don&apos;t really spend much time looking, but I pay a bit of attention in case there are any obvious ones.
		Today, I managed to spot one.
		I used to find these things all the time, as a child.
		I spread the other clover stems away for a better photograph.
		While I tried to put them back in place a bit when I was done, I still think the four-leafer&apos;s even more obvious now, so it&apos;s probably going to get picked by someone soon.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="health">
	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>
		My dietitian sent me some stuff in the mail.
		First is a letter telling me that a Japanese term they&apos;d mentioned to me when we last spoke, which means to eat until 80% full.
		They couldn&apos;t think of the term itself during our meeting.
		It seems the term is &quot;hara hachi bun&quot; or &quot;hara hachi bu&quot;.
		They also mentioned an author in the letter, and listed a couple books they thought I might like.
		I might check for them at the local library when I have time.
		They also said my &quot;interest, motivation, attendance, &amp; participation&quot;.
		I feel like I wouldn&apos;t have signed up for the class if i didn&apos;t have the interest and motivation, and I didn&apos;t really feel like attendance was optional once registered.
		I don&apos;t think I participated any more than the other participants, but then again, some of them didn&apos;t make every meeting like I felt I had to.
		The other thing they sent was that recipe for lentil/mushroom loaf.
		It&apos;ll take some deciphering because the handwriting isn&apos;t completely clear, and some translation, because it&apos;s in United State units instead of standard Metric units, but I&apos;m excited to try it when I have time to work out the details.
	</p>
