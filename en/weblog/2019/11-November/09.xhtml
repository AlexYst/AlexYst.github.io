	<h2>Fitness</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m always down on myself about how fat I am.
		But today, I noticed one of my workmates&apos; bellies sags down from where it hangs out.
		Mine hangs out too far, and that&apos;s undeniable.
		But at least I don&apos;t have to worry about the thing drooping.
		I need to work on shedding more fat, but seeing this reminded me that some of this is just me being hard on myself.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		In the past, when I took screenshots, I neglected to tag them.
		Today, I went back and tagged my 2018 screenshots.
		As I did so, I saw how I actually seemed to get a decent amount of building done in the past.
		More than I do now.
		I was even worse at building than I am now, but at least I built.
		In my more-recent world, I really didn&apos;t much.
		That said, I had all the materials set to be renewable, and getting minerals was much easier than it is now.
		I had more to work with.

	<h2>Hair-removal</h2>
	<p>
		Today was Saturday, so it was time for another home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment.
		It looks like my Tuesday treatments are done though, so I don&apos;t have to worry about those any more until I move on to another section.
		I&apos;m really not seeing any results though.
		I don&apos;t think the home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> is actually helping.
