<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I finally went through the new Minetest Game code in 5.1.0.
		I found a couple oddities, both relating to dry grass.
		First, dirt with dry grass no longer spreads to other dirt nodes, dirt nodes no longer turn into dirt with dry grass when under dry grass nodes, and dirt with dry grass is no longer placed by the map generator.
		This means that dirt with dry grass is no longer present in the game, except in maps that it was placed into before version 5.1.0.
		Yet the node isn&apos;t aliased to the new dry dirt with dry grass node, which is rather odd.
		Secondly, while dry dirt with dry grass drops dry dirt, there&apos;s absolutely no way to convert dry dirt back into dry dirt with dry grass.
		It&apos;s just like how permafrost with stones and permafrost with moss behaved in regards to dropping bare permafrost in the development versions before it made it into a stable version, except this time, the behaviour made it into a stable version.
		This makes dry dirt a new element, and having <code>liblevelup</code> correctly detect it as element without also incorrectly detecting dirt dropped by its variants as elements requires yet another hack be added to the detection algorithm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because I&apos;ve limited where I&apos;ll be playing, at least for the time being, I&apos;ve taken a look around what will be my territory.
		It&apos;s very wintry and very wet.
		My main resource will definitely be the pine trees on the island I spawn at.
		The only other tree species I&apos;ll have access to is apple trees, in the far south.
		There are no jungles, so that means no cotton.
		The starting island therefore definitely needs to be set up as my permanent base of operations while I&apos;m in this region.
		I didn&apos;t really pay attention, but I might be able to get ahold of apple bushes and/or pine bushes, but those are far less useful than their tree counterparts.
		There might be some blueberry bushes under some of the snow, too.
		Coral and dry dirt, on the other hand, are out of the question.

<section id="hormones">
	<h2>Hormone therapy</h2>
	<p>
		I learned from Freya that her girlfriend&apos;s hormone therapy is covered by medicare.
		Interesting.
		Honestly, I didn&apos;t think it would be.
		I couldn&apos;t help but think about trying to get on hormones myself to fix my masculine body.
		My reason for not doing it was never about the money though, so I quickly shot down the idea.
		The reason I don&apos;t use hormones is that they&apos;d not only fix my body, but also mess up my brain.
		If you&apos;re a woman, transwoman or otherwise, testosterone blockers and oestrogen supplements shouldn&apos;t mess with you much.
		But I&apos;m not feminine enough to be a woman.
		My testosterone level is lower than that of a man, but it&apos;s still prominent enough that it likely shapes my personality.
		And my oestrogen level can&apos;t be as high as a female&apos;s, though I haven&apos;t had that tested.
		I fear that hormone therapy would turn me into a woman, because I&apos;m not one already.
		I&apos;m somewhere between being a man and being a woman, and hormones would throw of that balance.
		I would cease to exist, and something else would inhabit my body instead.
	</p>

<section id="paperwork">
	<h2>Name-change form</h2>
	<p>
		That change-of-name paperwork from American Express arrived today.
		I&apos;m just going to ignore it though.
		They mentioned it in the other letter they sent, and I responded to that.
		A second response before they&apos;ve replied to my first isn&apos;t going to do any good.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="return">
	<h2>The return of former managers</h2>
	<p>
		I learned at work today that three of the former managers that quit recently are coming back to work now.
		All at the same time, for some reason.
		This includes the assistant manager that recently left us, as well as two regular shift leaders.
		They were part of a group composing about half the crew that quit on mass, and now they&apos;re returning.
		And they&apos;re retaining their manager status, though I doubt the former assistant manager will be back as an assistant manager.
		They&apos;ll probably be a regular shift leader.
		Still though, after the recent people quitting and now these people returning, literally half the crew is going to be a manager of some sort or an other.
		We&apos;ll have ten managers and ten non-managers.
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager said they think they only quit to avoid the Halloween rush, as that&apos;s our busiest day of the year.
		I&apos;m not convinced.
		I wonder why they&apos;d all come back at once though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="bonuses">
	<h2>Bonuses</h2>
	<p>
		The head manager decided to leave early, and had me close shop again.
		We were so far ahead that there wasn&apos;t much point in the head manager sticking around.
		After they left, the rest of us started talking a bit.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems that last month, the other new shift leader got $60 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> of the head manager&apos;s bonus.
		Wow.
		And I only thought I remembered getting $20 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>, myself.
		That really showed me how much less the head manager thinks of me.
		As I started writing about this though, I started thinking they&apos;d given me a fifty-dollar bill, not a twenty-dollar bill.
		I grepped my journal, and sure enough, it was fifty dollars.
		Wow.
		My memory is horribly unreliable.
		Why&apos;d I think they gave me only twenty?
		I guess I deserve to miss that extra ten dollars just for being unappreciative.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems that last year, the assistant manager that normally works mornings also got a $500 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> bonus at one point.
		That&apos;s almost an entire extra pay cheque, there, but then again, they&apos;re one of the assistant managers.
		They deal with a lot of the garbage that comes up even on their days off and barely even complain about it.
		I&apos;m not even sure if what they say can even be considered truly complaining even.
		They deserve the extra money.
		And also, this was obviously a different month, so it has no bearing on the bonus from the end of the month before last.

<section id="spite">
	<h2>Spite</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure how it came up, but one of my workmates said I should get a vasectomy, just to spite Summer.
		She thinks of me as just a penis, only fit to extend her bloodline?
		Getting a vasectomy would show her!
		I found it hilarious.
		I didn&apos;t tell them I&apos;d already gotten a vasectomy.
		It wasn&apos;t to spite Summer though.
		I was going through some rough emotions, and thought the vasectomy could help me clear things up.
		Some part of me thought I shouldn&apos;t be exclusively attracted to males, yet another part of me was horrified by the thought of pregnancy, and wanted to stay as far away from a relationship with a female as possible.
		I was right.
		The vasectomy helped.
		It helped a lot.
		It quieted a lot of the turbulence in my mind.
		And it even seems to have killed that tiny part of me that, against everything the rest of me stands for, for some reason wanted to pass on these Squid-damn genes.
		I did the right thing, and I regret nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		At first, I said that there&apos;s no way I&apos;d go anywhere near a female sexually without having a vasectomy.
		It has nothing to do with spite.
		Later, I said a better plan would be to adopt children, claim them to be my own, and not let Summer ever meet them.
		That&apos;d show her.
		My workmate said I could do their idea, then mine, for added effect.
		Still later, I asked them if they knew what trans tucking is.
		Their idea of it is a bit off, and they seem to think it involves turning the penis inside out, but they get the general gist of that it hides unsightly male bulges.
		So I said I do it, and that if Summer ever came over, I could drop my pants, but not my underwear, and show her how flat I am.
		She wants to think of me as a penis?
		Look at this!
		As far as you can tell, I don&apos;t even have a penis or testicles any more!
		I might as well be dead to you, now.
		It was fun to think about, but it&apos;s really not worth my energy to actually do it.
		The effort it would take to even undo my belt or even just slide my pants down is more effort than I care to put toward her any more.
		There&apos;s just not enough emotion left there to even want to spite her.
	</p>

<section id="clocks">
	<h2>Daylight Saving Time will end forever!</h2>
	<p>
		We had a customer come in pretty late, and they thought we&apos;d be closed by then.
		It turns out today was the day Daylight Saving Time ended.
		I hadn&apos;t noticed.
		And they hadn&apos;t either, so their clock was off.
		One of my workmates was the one to point it out.
		My clocks is emulated by my laptop, so it updates automatically.
		I hate Daylight Saving Time though.
		It&apos;s ridiculous.
		I mentioned that I wouldn&apos;t mind if businesses changed their open hours seasonally, but the clocks should stay the same year round.
		That was when they gave us excellent news.
	</p>
	<p>
		That bill I mentioned before has gone through.
		It seems that this spring, we&apos;ll set the clocks ahead as before, but then we&apos;ll just leave them that way.
		Forever.
		Daylight Saving Time will just be permanently active.
		Awesome.
		I don&apos;t care which way we set the clocks, as long as we pick a setting and stick with it.
		I still find it odd that we&apos;re not doing standard time year-round, by daylight time year-round will work just as well.
