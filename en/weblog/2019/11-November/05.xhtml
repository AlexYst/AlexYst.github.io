	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		The doctor returned the container I&apos;d brought them brownies in, now with a thank you note inside instead.
		Though the note was such a simple gesture, it meant more to me than I thought it would.
		I guess I should write more thank you notes myself.
		I don&apos;t because I never think they&apos;ll mean much to the recipient, but I guess for some people, they can.
	</p>
	<p>
		The doctor also had a frustrating story for me.
		It seems they&apos;re trying to sell their house, and someone made an appointment to see it.
		They took off their jewellery - including their wedding ring - to take a shower before the showing, and forgot to put it back on.
		They left it on the dresser, and by the time they remembered it, it&apos;d been stolen by the potential buyer.
		Joy.
		You can&apos;t replace something that sentimental.
	</p>
	<p>
		As per usual, the doctor had me brief them on the current status of my face.
		My beard hair won&apos;t clear up.
		Most of the darkest hairs are gone, but the lighter hairs remain.
		I&apos;d be fine with short, light hairs, but these ones are long.
		They clarified things a bit.
		It seems I&apos;m probably always going to have a beard, which is rather frustrating.
		I knew some lighter hairs would stay, but I&apos;d thought at least the lengthy ones would go.
		But no.
		I&apos;m going to have to keep shaving all the time, even once we&apos;re done with this.
		I wonder how effective this will be on my back.
		The problem is that I can&apos;t reach it to shave, so it has to remain hairy, I guess, but getting that hair lightened might be nice.
		If the home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> doesn&apos;t work though, there&apos;s no point in getting the parts of me that I can reach professionally done.
	</p>
	<p>
		The doctor said that the reason they have a hairless face isn&apos;t the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment, which they had undergone themselves.
		Rather, it&apos;s because they shave it off.
		I decided to pay more attention to the faces of females at my workplace.
		None of my female workmates that were in today seem to have hairy faces, even just light hair that can be seen up close.
		I didn&apos;t notice any hair on the faces of female customers, either, and I was working a register for the first time in a while today.
		Are all these people shaving their faces?
		I never hear of women doing that.
		Granted, I&apos;ve seen women with light moustaches before.
		But overall, that&apos;s not what I tend to see.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the treatment, the doctor said that they know the pain is the worst.
		I disagreed though.
		I replied that I&apos;d endure the pain every day if it meant people would stop calling me a &quot;he&quot;.
		The pain of being misgendered surely isn&apos;t the worst, but it&apos;s worse than the pain of the <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> by a long shot.
		That <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> is by far not the worst.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of the appointment though, they referred to me as a &quot;him&quot; twice to their assistant.
		My heart fell.
		I thought they were different.
		They caught themself, which was better than most people, who don&apos;t even care at all, but that means they still think of me a a man.
		And that really stings, especially after seeing that in their mobile, I noticed that I&apos;m listed as a female.
	</p>
	<p>
		They said they want me to read the first chapter of a particular book, and they want to debate it with me.
		I&apos;m intrigued.
		I pulled out my pen to write down the name of it, because I was sure I&apos;d forget before I could get to the local library, and they said they&apos;d lend me their copy later.
		So i still don&apos;t know the title or even what the book&apos;s about.
		A bit later, they said they might give me the book for Christmas.
		I&apos;m not Christian.
		I have neither the right nor the responsibility to celebrate Christmas.
		But I guess we&apos;re doing Christmas presents?
		I guess I need to think of something to give them then.
		And fast.
	</p>
	<p>
		They gave me half off on today&apos;s appointment.
		They&apos;d circled the spots on my face they thought still needed work, and the treatment seemed to be done rather quickly, so in retrospect, it was probably more of a spot treatment than a full treatment.
		They wanted me to see how it came out, and telephone them later to set up an appointment if need be.
		I tried to tell them I don&apos;t have telephone service, but could drop by in-person to check in later, but they cut me off after I&apos;d just said I don&apos;t have telephone service, and I couldn&apos;t get another word in until they&apos;d told me we&apos;d instead set up an appointment for six weeks out instead of the usual four weeks.
		So my next appointment is on December 17.
		I suppose it&apos;d be best to have my Christmas present for them picked out by then.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t head straight home, as I had errands to run, but once I did get home, I also had the home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment to take care of.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I experimented with cutting the map generator short today.
		When I set the node generation limit to 464, the upper bounds of the map in all three directions is 463.
		This makes perfect sense, as the game still only generates entire map chunks.
		If a map chunk lies partly outside the range, the entire chunk doesn&apos;t get generated.
		However, when I set the limit to 463, I found that that outer block didn&apos;t get get generated.
		Instead, the map only went out to 415.
		I don&apos;t get it.
		I think there&apos;s a mistake in the code, honestly, and the wrong comparison operator is being used somewhere (less than instead of less than or equal to), resulting in the actual generation limit effectively being one node smaller than what you specify.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, cutting the generation short allowed me to notice something I hadn&apos;t before: I can very nearly see the edge of my defined sector from the off-centre spawn point.
		I mean, I knew the spawn point was closer to one edge than the others, but I didn&apos;t realise just how small the my defined playing space is.
		It&apos;s no wonder I don&apos;t have many biomes to work with!
		I might not actually have as much space as I&apos;d pictured, but there&apos;s still quite a lot of space and it&apos;ll be a while before I have to move on.
		This area will still do very nicely.
		Besides, if I made the sectors much larger, I&apos;d risk the maps generated from the sectors stretching my journal pages on small monitors.
		If I wasn&apos;t going to post daily map renders though, I&apos;d certainly expand my playing field a great deal.
		I might build one of the rest houses I mentioned yesterday as my starting house, just because I then won&apos;t need to build a small extra house to work from as I prepare construction of something better.
		The rest houses are meant to be small, and don&apos;t need many accommodations.
	</p>

<section id="searching">
	<h2>Google and Firefox</h2>
	<p>
		A workmate told me so &quot;Google&quot; something.
		I forget what.
		I find it a mild nuisance when people tell me to &quot;Google&quot; stuff as if Google is the only way to search the Web.
		Because of that, I usually jump right to telling them that I&apos;m banned from Google, and in the process, I unintentionally forget what it was they wanted me to search for.
		(As a side note, Google&apos;s ban on me isn&apos;t a hard ban that makes their site completely and totally unusable, it&apos;s just a soft ban, requiring me to solve a <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> before they&apos;ll let me do anything else.
		I wouldn&apos;t want to use Google anyway, but on the rare occasion I end up there for some reason, I see the <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> wall and immediately leave.)
		They asked why, so I gave my usual spiel about how Google bans me because I won&apos;t give them my personal information, and how they try to get users&apos; personal information so they can sell it to advertisers.
		Seriously, I&apos;m pretty sure they have most - if not all - of <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> blocked just to make it more difficult to use their services without giving them an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address to use get a good idea of your geographical location.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, my workmate told me that if I couldn&apos;t use Google, to use Firefox instead.
		I was confused at first.
		I use Firefox and Google still blocks me.
		They meant to use Firefox <strong>*instead*</strong> of google though, as if Firefox were a search engine and not a Web browser.
		They probably use both Google and Firefox on a regular basis, and aren&apos;t sure what the two are.
		They think they&apos;re replacements for one another.
		I get not being super aware of niche tech, but I feel like you should know what a search engine and a Web browser are, and that they&apos;re very different technologies.

<section id="queer">
	<h2>Queer</h2>
	<p>
		I was working the front register today, and helping out on landing when I was free from the customers.
		The person on drive-through asked me to cut just one of the cheese breads of a pair I was taking out of the double pan we cook them in, as they needed it.
		I tried to hide my irritation, and replied that it takes just as long to cut one as it does two.
		It actually takes a couple seconds longer, but by cutting them both at once, you save a lot of time.
		They&apos;re small, and you can just run the cutter through both if you set them side-by-side, and its irritating when people in a rush take only one out of the pan and cut it.
		I then have to come by and put in just as much effort as it&apos;d take to cut two, but only get the single cheese bread they left behind cut.
		I&apos;d just had to do that a bit ago when they&apos;d done that, and now they were trying to get me to do it to myself.
		A bit later, I was dealing with a customer, and came back to see they&apos;d done it themself again.
		I remarked to the lander that that sort of thing irks me, and they agreed, and also made sure I was aware it wasn&apos;t them, but the drive-through worker.
		I assured them I already knew.
		Our conversation lasted a bit longer than I&apos;d intended, and the drive-through person overheard part of it as they came by, inquiring as to what&apos;d happened.
		I explained, and they said they&apos;d try to work on that.
		I told them they didn&apos;t need to, and that it was just something that bugged me personally, not something that they needed to even worry about.
		You know what they said?
		They said they try to learn what each manager&apos;s pet peeves are, then try to change their workflow depending on which bosses are present.
		I made sure to let them know that this isn&apos;t my pet peeve.
		What really bothers me is when people refer to me as a &quot;he&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
		Seriously though, we&apos;ve had the pronoun conversation a number of times, and they always write me off.
		I don&apos;t want them pretending to care about irritating me when they clearly aren&apos;t doing the one simple thing that would remove the  most irritation.
		I get bothered by stupidity in the workplace, including inefficiencies such as doubling the effort needed to get the cheese breads cut, but it&apos;s sort of like when a fly won&apos;t quit landing on you when you keep shooing it away.
		It&apos;s a bother, but the bother quickly goes away when the fly does.
		Likewise, by the time I&apos;ve already cut and put away the second cheese bread, I&apos;ve stopped caring.
		The sting of being called a &quot;he&quot; feels like people think my core defining aspect is my penis, and because I have that, they have to assign separate pronouns to me.
		That hurts, and the hurt doesn&apos;t just go away.
		It&apos;s not just a mild nuisance.
	</p>
	<p>
		I overheard some customers in the lobby as they were waiting for their food.
		I don&apos;t know if the conversation was prompted by my &quot;they/them&quot; button, but it sounded like they were saying someone in their life had &quot;gender identity disorder&quot;.
		That didn&apos;t sit right at all with me, but I couldn&apos;t jump in.
		It sounded like they meant someone with gender dysphoria though.
		One person was saying that they didn&apos;t get it, and wished the person with gender dysphoria would stop pressing the issue.
		I thought &quot;Well if you stop misgendering them, they won&apos;t need to keep pressing the issue, would they? Do they misgender you? Probably not. Yet you find yourself unable to show that same respect to them.&quot;.
		The other person said something about how it was probably because the gender dysphoric person cared about the complainer, and felt that their own viewpoint was right.
		It sounded like the suggestion was that they hoped to bring the complainer to their side, as if this was some sort of debate.
		No, it&apos;s not a debate.
		Science and modern medicine are on our side.
		Gender dysphoria is real, and gender does not always match sex.
		This isn&apos;t open for debate.
		It&apos;s fact.
		If you want to argue it, first do your research, then debate with the scientists and doctors that know what they&apos;re talking about.
		Don&apos;t just write off the idea just because you don&apos;t care, then claim the idea of caring to be wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		I learned the other new shift leader is bisexual today.
		Another queer!
		There&apos;s more of us than I&apos;d previously realised.
		It came out though because they were telling one of our workmates that they were bi, and our workmate didn&apos;t believe them.
		So they were telling me about that.
		Apparently, they thought I knew.
		Apparently, they thought it was obvious.
		I responded that it&apos;s hard to tell sometimes who people are attracted to, and behaviours in other areas aren&apos;t always a giveaway.
		I&apos;ve seen them express attraction toward the opposite sex.
		And I&apos;ve seen them joke about attraction to the same sex.
		I&apos;ve never seen them express serious attraction toward the same sex though.
		When they talk about same-sex attraction, it&apos;s always been either abstract jokes not directed toward anyone in particular or jokes directed at people I think to be heterosexual, including one person that&apos;s already married to an opposite-sex partner.
		Interestingly though, I don&apos;t think they have the same quirky personality traits other queers I&apos;ve met share with me.
		They&apos;re ... almost normal.
		We seem to have very similar ideas about things though.
		I guess the main differences personality-wise is that I like to mess with people more than I should, while they hold things together more, and they&apos;re a drug user, while I avoid drugs like the plague.
		They agree that having children is a bad idea though, and they&apos;re an agnostic Catholic, while I&apos;m an agnostic atheist.
		We agree that the world is horrible, that people are terrible, and that life isn&apos;t a very nice curse to inflict on anyone.
		We&apos;ve always gotten along pretty well.
		Under different circumstances, perhaps we would have made a good romantic pair.
		I don&apos;t see me partnering with a drug user though.
		I could easily be friends with one, but I wouldn&apos;t want drugs in my home.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of the day, I found the duct tape I&apos;ve been using has left some new wounds on me.
		And these ones are weeping.
		Joy.
		They sting, and the ooze seeping out of them is a bit unpleasant.
		I have to keep doing this though.
		What choice do I have?
		I can&apos;t get the gaff to work, so tape seems to be the only working solution.
