	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I experimented and planned a bit in Minetest today.
		I thought I was going to watermark my maps by building what was essentially a giant, horizontal billboard in-game.
		This billboard would have my Web address on it, so anyone rudely hotlinking the image would be forced to display my <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.
		Really, that&apos;s all I watermark my images for, which is why I typically do it with a non-intrusive strip added to the side.
		If anyone downloads the images, they can easily remove the watermark in an image editor and host them themself; the image is undamaged, aside from the photos.
		The photos are in <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format, a lossy compression format, and my understanding is that every time you edit the image, some quality is lost.
		That&apos;s why I keep unmarked copies in the repository.
		My goal is never to make the images unreusable, just deter hotlinkers and get something from hotlinkers that aren&apos;t deterred.
		Anyway, I tried out several billboard configurations, but never found something I liked.
		Tiny ones were too easy to overlook, and huge ones distracted from the map content.
		It&apos;s basically pixel art, but where I have limited colour choice, the colours are altered by the shape of the surroundings, I have to gather materials for each pixel, and I&apos;ve got to manually put the pixels in place in the game.
		It&apos;s a pain in the neck and would have to be completed on the first day, but would never have to be completed again.
		At least in this sector.
		In the end, I decided I&apos;ll just have to watermark the images by hand,as I do with the photos.
		What pushed me over the edge on this decision was the fact that I&apos;d need to litter the world with these billboards.
		With careful planning, I&apos;d only need one billboard for every two sectors, as I could put them at an overlap, but if a larger map were ever drawn of the place, all these billboards everywhere would look rather spammy.
		Unlike the photos, I don&apos;t need to provide unmarked copies though, because they&apos;re in <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr> form and don&apos;t lose quality with editing.
		Still, that&apos;s seven extra images to modify each week, which is a bit of a pain.
		I find it difficult enough some days just to get my entries written up at all, let alone pop open the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr> and start tweaking images.
		At least I don&apos;t have to mark the screenshots; I added text to the <abbr title="heads-up display">HUD</abbr>, which looks much nicer than the pixel-based billboards that I was planning for the map.

	<h2>Bike trip</h2>
	<p>
		On the way to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, my gear shift line broke again.
		Joy.
		I don&apos;t have the energy to try to replace it right now.
		Not after last time.
		Getting the line not to fray as I feed it into the bike is an aggravating task that seems mostly to rely on luck.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I got to the meeting, I found I&apos;d brought the wrong journal entry files on my <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> drive and had to return home right away.
		Instead of a few hours to rest between halves of the round trip, I ended up needing to bike the whole 26 kilometres mostly in one go.
		That&apos;s always tiring.
