	<h2>Weight</h2>
	<p>
		This morning, I decided to start weighing myself daily, instead of periodically, and record the results on my calendar.
		I&apos;m not going to be putting every last recording in my journal or anything like that, but I&apos;m excited about today&apos;s recording.
		I&apos;m down to 99.7.
		I&apos;m back under 100 kilograms!
		Sure, it&apos;s an arbitrary point, but having that extra digit there has been making me a bit self-conscious, so I&apos;m glad to loose it.
		Weight naturally fluctuates a bit though, so until I get down further, it&apos;s very likely I&apos;ll go up and down past 100 kilograms repeatedly.
		Additionally, by the end of the day, I&apos;d binged a bit out of frustration about my stolen wallet, so I&apos;m most likely going to be up above that mark as soon as tomorrow.
	</p>

<section id="wallet">
	<h2>Stolen wallet</h2>
	<p>
		When I wake up my laptop, it takes a bit for the new email to come in.
		It&apos;s got to connect to the network, then <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>&apos;s got to set up a route, then the email client has to notice that the proxy is now working.
		The point is, it takes time if I don&apos;t try to rust the thing, so I tend to wake the machine, do other stuff, and check back later.
		When I noticed the new emails, I started reading through them, and saw an odd charge on my Discover card.
		Five dollars at a restaurant I haven&apos;t been to in a while.
		Was I in the right section of my inbox?
		It looked like I was.
		I read more emails, and found more charges, this time, clearly bogus ones.
		Twelve and a half dollars at that same restaraut?
		I only ever get a single sandwich there, and always the cheapest one.
		Not because it&apos;s  the cheapest, but because it&apos;s the only vegan one.
		Two charges at a grocery store I don&apos;t even know the location of?
		Sixty dollars at a second-hand store I haven&apos;t been to in a while?
		Someone was charging to my Discover account.
		But how?
	</p>
	<p>
		After that day a customer tried to get me to claim to be a man, I started carrying my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> in a smaller wallet that I can actually fit in my pocket.
		For good measure, I put one of my credit cards in it too, and used that wallet when I was packing light.
		When I switched to feminine work pants, I found it barely fit in the ridiculously-tiny pockets of my new pants, but it did fit, so I continued to carry it.
		Yesterday in particular, I noticed the wallet wasn&apos;t fitting well.
		It&apos;s one of the tiniest wallets I&apos;ve ever seen, but these pockets aren&apos;t a functional size at all.
		I don&apos;t remember taking my wallet out of my pocket after work, and checking my pants today, I saw I hadn&apos;t left it there.
		It probably fell out on the way home from work.
		All that leg motion must have caused it to work its way out.
	</p>
	<p>
		I logged into my Discover account.
		I was greeted with the following list of charges:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
<pre>11/11/19 	11 GOODWILL INDU 	$57.45
11/11/19 	GET N GO GROCERY 3 	$49.35
11/11/19 	Get N Go 	$41.38
11/11/19 	Subway Restaurant 	$12.48
11/11/19 	Subway Restaurant 	$4.99</pre>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		None of those were from me.
		I hadn&apos;t even left my apartment yet today!
		The charges seemed to be listed in reverse chronological order, and the next (or rather, previous) charge was the one from paying my doctor.
		These five charges add up to $165.65 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> though.
		Whoever found my wallet stole $165.65 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> from me.
		I immediately put the account on lock-down, or as Discover puts it, &quot;froze&quot; the account.
		I then filed the card as lost/stolen (there&apos;s no separate options for these two cases), and contacted Discover support about the charges.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, I told them about the lost wallet, then the bogus charges, then that I&apos;d frozen the account and marked the card as lost/stolen.
		Next, I asked how to get the charges reversed.
		The first thing they did was try to feed me garbage about telephoning them to get help.
		No thanks.
		I replied that I have no telephone service, and asked how to proceed.
		They kept trying to push the telephone option, and I had to start asking if I was just out the $165.65 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		They would not give me a straight answer, and just kept pushing the telephone option.
		All the while, their website kept having hiccups, killing the Web chat, and telling me to reload the page to fix it.
		I&apos;m honestly surprised that the chat continued even after page reloads.
		I would have thought for sure I&apos;d&apos;ve had to start a new conversation, reach a new representative, and have to start explaining everything from the top, but I never did.
	</p>
	<p>
		In another tab, I started trying to dispute the charges.
		I found instructions, but they weren&apos;t working.
		They told me the option was in the charge&apos;s summary, but it wasn&apos;t.
		I started getting suspicious that because the charge hadn&apos;t finalised, it wasn&apos;t going to let me interact with it.
		So I tried the process on the doctor&apos;s charge.
		Sure enough, the dispute option was there.
		Needless to say, I didn&apos;t click the option there though, as I was just checking to see if the option would be present on a finalised charge.
		So I&apos;d have to wait until the bogus charges finalise, then dispute them.
		But I felt that if I waited, the dispute would be less likely to go in my favour.
		After all, what would be my excuse for not having gotten it taken care of right away when I have the account set to notify me of new charges right away?
		I should have known the very day they happened that there was a problem.
		And I do.
		They all happened this morning.
	</p>
	<p>
		All the while I worked, I was arguing with the representative, trying to get a straight answer.
		Finally, they said they wouldn&apos;t tell me I was out the money, admitting they wouldn&apos;t give me straight answer, which was the closest thing to a straight answer I felt I&apos;d get.
		In other words, I was just out the $165.65 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> and they didn&apos;t even have the decency to admit it.
		So much for their &quot;$0 fraud liability guarantee&quot;.
		So I started attacking the problem from another angle, in the back of my mind, planning to dispute charges when they finalise when this didn&apos;t work.
		I asked repeatedly about submitting forms via post.
		Again, I was just going to keep asking until they gave me a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.
		They kept pushing the telephone option, but never would tell me that it couldn&apos;t be done via post.
		Finally, they tried another angle themself, and said we could dispute the charges instead.
		I told them I tried that, and gave them my guess as to why the site wouldn&apos;t let me; they confirmed my guess to be correct.
		They asked about changing card number and reissuing the card.
		I replied that I&apos;s started that process through the interface already if the option in the interface is the same thing, and that I also froze account.
		I said nothing about the fact that this was one of the first things I&apos;d told them.
		It turns out the process I started was similar, though somehow a little different.
		They didn&apos;t specify as to how, but there was no reason to do both and change the number twice, wasting a card number.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end, I ended up arguing with Discover for just under an hour.
		Just because they don&apos;t want to provide basic account services to people without telephones.
		What a pain.
		And the card wasn&apos;t the only thing lost.
		There was also my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		I&apos;m not going to be able to deposit my pay cheque tomorrow without that.
		Lovely.
	</p>
	<p>
		At least it&apos;s Monday though, I thought.
		I can head down to the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> to get my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> reissued.
		While I was in-chat with Discover, I was also rummaging through my files to find the ones I thought I&apos;d need to get my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> replaced: my Social Security card, my birth certificate, and my change-of-name court order.
		I figured they&apos;d want to see the Social Security card and the birth certificate, and since the birth certificate doesn&apos;t have the correct name on it, I&apos;d need the change-of-name document to explain that away.
		I wouldn&apos;t get the new <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> right away.
		It would take a while to arrive, as they insist on sending it via post.
		My understanding is that it&apos;s minted in some other place, to be honest, so the only other option they could reasonably provide would be to pick them up in-office after getting them sent there, which would take even longer.
		But also, they want to make sure you give them your actual postal address.
		That only discourages fake addresses though, as they have a send-to-other-address option.
		They&apos;d still have this other address on file though, no doubt, it just wouldn&apos;t be printed on the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		Anyway, I wanted to get the replacement process started as soon as possible, so I headed over.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, I found the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> is closed today due to holiday.
		Joy.
		I get to head in tomorrow, which is already a busy errand day.
		I don&apos;t want to add this out-of-the-way errand to the list, and head in another direction entirely.
		It looks like I&apos;ve got no choice though.
		It&apos;s just not going to happen today.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way home, I tried to cut a corner by biking up onto the sidewalk where I was going to turn.
		Unfortunately, The ramp wasn&apos;t flush with the street, and I hit it at a bad angle.
		The bike went tumbling, and I went flying with it.
		The good news is that I&apos;ve gotten very good at falling from my time without non-slip shoes after my shoes were stolen at work.
		I roughed up my palms and my right knee a bit, but I transitioned that momentum into a roll and took the brunt of the impact with my back.
		If you don&apos;t fight the fall, and just spread out and take it on the back, the wide surface area of your back spreads out the force pretty effectively, and you don&apos;t get hurt much.
		You still get winded, but you recover pretty quickly.
		Still, this really isn&apos;t my day.
	</p>
	<p>
		My losses aren&apos;t a tonne, assuming that the charges get reversed, which they may or may not at this point.
		I lost my rainbow credit card, which will be reissued.
		If the charges don&apos;t get reversed, that won&apos;t matter because I&apos;ll be cancelling the account anyway.
		Or maybe I won&apos;t.
		Maybe I&apos;ll keep the account open to add to my available credit to help my credit score, but I&apos;ll leave the account frozen.
		In either case, if the charges aren&apos;t reversed, I won&apos;t be using that card again.
		I lost my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		How much will it cost to replace it?
		I don&apos;t recall.
		I want to say about $30 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> though.
		But I&apos;ve been a bit bothered by the photo on my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> anyway.
		My face is so much less chubby now, and the photo on my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is an ugly reminder of what I used to look like.
		I&apos;d still rather keep the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> than throw away the money to replace it, but I can&apos;t call this a total loss either.
		I lost my shopping list.
		I started writing it becasue of two specific items I kept forgetting to get, and kept having a difficult time remembering what they were.
		I was able to come up with both items though, along with the two additional items I later added that I didn&apos;t think I would forget, but figured might as well be on the list anyway just because there was a list at all.
		I lost two dimes.
		I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s literally all the cash the wallet contained.
		And I lost the wallet itself.
		Overall, this could have been worse.
		A lot worse.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, I mentioned the wallet theft to someone.
		They said that Discover had to allow the charge to be reversed.
		I said I hoped that was the case, but it looked like they likely wouldn&apos;t.
		Their next idea was to file a report with the police department.
		Now that&apos;s an idea I hadn&apos;t come up with.
		Honestly, I don&apos;t think that&apos;ll do a bit of good, but it also wouldn&apos;t hurt, and certainly beats just sitting on my hands and hoping things turn out fine.
		I guess I&apos;ll do that tomorrow too.
		I don&apos;t feel like I have time to do that on top of everything else though, given that I work that day too.
		I&apos;m just going to postpone my bottle-returning errand.
		I figured I&apos;d hit up the police station on the way to the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr>, then make a big loop to hit the store with the Tuesday drawing.
		I&apos;d skip the bottle-returning, and due to not having my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, also skip depositing my pay cheque and paying the electric bill.
	</p>
	<p>
		On my way home from work, I thought about what filing a report with the police would likely entail.
		They&apos;d probably type something up based on what I said, then have me sign it.
		And they&apos;d refer to me as a &quot;he&quot; in the report they&apos;d try to get me to sign.
		I&apos;d have to reject that and try to get them to fix it.
		To have the best chance of success, I&apos;d need to show them on my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> - which was stolen so I don&apos;t have it - that I&apos;ve neither the &quot;M&quot; nor &quot;F&quot; designation, but instead the &quot;X&quot; designation.
		That&apos;s okay though, I&apos;d just bring an expired copy of my <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>.
		They wouldn&apos;t know what the &quot;X&quot; designation means, but I&apos;d explain it.
		The important hurdle would be jumped, as they&apos;d understand that men have the &quot;M&quot; designation, women have the &quot;F&quot; designation, and they&apos;d see that I had neither.
		I could explain the rest myself.
		When I got home, I located the box I keep cards I don&apos;t keep in my wallet, which includes cards that are expired as well as cards that are still valid but that I for various reasons don&apos;t use.
		I found my old <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> cards, but I couldn&apos;t find any with the &quot;X&quot; designation.
		Where&apos;d my other one go?
		Did I lose that one?
		After searching through the cards again, I remembered: I have another with my current legal name on it, but not one with the &quot;X&quot; designation.
		That one had been my first, and now I don&apos;t have it.
		In other words, I have to stop by the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> before the police station, as I&apos;ll then have the temporary <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> they issue.
		Because the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> and the police station are my two most important stops on that trip, they&apos;ve got to be the first two I take care of.
		I&apos;m going to need to head way out to the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr>, then return most of the way home to reach the police station, then head back out for the drawing.
		What a pain in the rear.
		If I hadn&apos;t already given up on all my other errands for the day, this would have made me give up on them.
		The drawing is only on Tuesday, and the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> and police station trips need to be taken care of as soon as possible, but everything else can wait a bit.

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		To take my mind off my frustration, I turned my mind to Minetest as I worked.
		I really like the idea of a tiered approach to stat-based renewal, and my grouping system from yesterday just doesn&apos;t support that.
		I guess I&apos;ll do element-specific renewal methods after all.
		In my initial design, there&apos;ll be eleven obtainable, renewable elements which can be used to renew nine obtainable, nonrenewable elements.
		The nine obtainable, nonrenewable elements will be used to renew everything else that can&apos;t otherwise be renewed.
		Except beach sand.
		Five unobtainable, renewable elements will renew beach sand, with beach sand being the only unobtainable, nonrenewable element.
		I&apos;m not sure what good the beach sand catalyst crystal will do though.
		Maybe I&apos;ll make seaweed unable to be renewed via other means, and only renewable through the beach sand crystal or something.
	</p>

<section id="padding">
	<h2>Padding</h2>
	<p>
		As a consolation prize for all the frustration of the day, I got to implement something after work that I&apos;ve been looking into over the past couple days.
		I&apos;ve been looking into how to achieve a more feminine bust.
		I&apos;m not looking for hormones or surgery, but just a way to improve the appearance of my shape while fully dressed.
		I&apos;ve been considering getting one of those suction pumps that helps people grow breasts, but that&apos;s rather permanent, and I&apos;d rather think about it for a while.
		I&apos;d like to try out the look, first.
		What I&apos;ve found is that the best clothing-based option is probably to get these life-like fake breast layers, and put them into the pockets of my bra where the padding that keeps my nipples from showing through my clothing go.
		But another solution I found online was to take multiple bra pads in one bra cup - removing them from one bra and transferring them to another.
		I&apos;ve taken four pads of various sizes per cup and stacked them, from largest to smallest, with the larger ones closest to my skin.
		The look is subtle in my street clothes, and even subtler in my work uniform, but I like it.
		I&apos;ll wear that bra tomorrow and see if anyone notices and says anything.
		Honestly, I don&apos;t think anyone will notice at first.
		I might need more pads.
		Also, I really need to lose the belly, for an even more-pronounced effect.
		I think I&apos;m going to make this a daily thing though.
