	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I got something on my shirt, an while it was in the wash, I started wearing this white sweatshirt with a cool, printed pattern on the front.
		For some reason, I put the back of a marker in my mouth.
		It leaked, and ended up with ink in my mouth.
		I got addicted to the flavour, and sucked the rest of the ink out.
		Then I got a fresh, orange marker, and sucked the ink out of that one too.
		I figured I wouldn&apos;t use the orange one, so it wouldn&apos;t matter if it were gone.
		I did the same with a third marker, this time hot pink.
		But this time, I looked beside me, and saw the ink had splattered on the refrigerator next to me.
		I looked at the sweatshirt, and saw it&apos;d been ruined by the ink as well.
		At that point, I knew I had a problem and needed to stop with the markers.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to find a large pot, hoping to try to boil the hot pink ink out of the shirt.
		It was a long shot, but maybe I could restore the shirt if I hurried.
		I finally found one, but it was all dirty, and was in a bathtub full of dirty dishes.
		I cleaned out the pot, and figured I really needed to stat chipping away at the dish situation once I got the pot boiling, but also thought I&apos;d need several days to finish all those dishes.

<section id="work">
	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Work was a bit hectic this morning.
		I passed by who I thought was a former workmate on the way there.
		They had a shift yesterday, and it was their first shift since being rehired after previously being fired.
		They claimed in and claimed they&apos;d be a couple hours late, then didn&apos;t show up at all, so I figured they&apos;d be fired again.
		I figured they&apos;d likely been rehired specifically because we were shorthanded and with yesterday being our busiest day of the year.
		But apparently, they didn&apos;t get fired, and had another shift today.
		They&apos;d showed up, clocked in, stayed a few minutes, didn&apos;t clock out, then just took off without a word.
		I arrived soon after that for my own shift.
		When the head manager got in, the assistant manager that&apos;d been the only other person working at the time it happened, double-checked with the head manager to be sure they actually were fired this time.
		The had manager says they&apos;re definitely gone, but that they consider them not to have even been hired, as they hadn&apos;t actually worked a single shift.
		So they&apos;re not calling it firing.
		Seriously though, what did they expect to accomplish by clocking in and taking off?
	</p>
	<p>
		Another employee called in, and said they&apos;d woken up late, and would arrive a bit late.
		Quite a while later, they still hadn&apos;t arrived, and the assistant manager telephoned them.
		Apparently, they told the head manager they wouldn&apos;t make it in at all.
		If the assistant manager hadn&apos;t called them though, we&apos;d have no idea what was going on; they didn&apos;t have the decency to let us know.
	</p>
	<p>
		After I&apos;d been working a bit, but before the oversleeping employee had called in, the assistant manager told me to call the shift leader that was scheduled to come in next and ask them to come in an hour early if they could.
		They said they&apos;d talk to one of their parents, and come in if they could.
		My guess is that they needed a babysitter for their own child, and were trying to get the child&apos;s grandparent to do it.
		I guess that didn&apos;t work out though, as they instead arrived at their regularly-scheduled time.
		By this time, we knew we were short two people.
	</p>
	<p>
		Morning crew is much more laid-back than evening crew.
		People do things such as wear street clothing on the job.
		It can get a bit cold, and often times, what they&apos;re wearing is a sweatshirt, or other garment warmer than the uniform.
		I don&apos;t really care, myself, but I wasn&apos;t even sure if the shift leader was clocked in yet when we opened our doors, as they were out of uniform.
		I&apos;ve been stuck working evening shifts mostly for years, with an odd morning shift every several months, so I hadn&apos;t remembered that not being in uniform in the morning doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re off the clock.
		The assistant manager was mixing and cutting the dough for tomorrow, which is what the employee that took off was supposed to be doing.
		I knew they couldn&apos;t do that and work a register.
		The other employee that came in at the same time as the shift leader brought to my attention that it was time to open, which I hadn&apos;t noticed because I was so busy trying to do the work of three people.
		(I did rather decently, for the most part.)
		They asked if they were working the front counter, so I put them on the front counter, and being the only person left that I knew was clocked in, I took the drive-through.
		That was a pain.
		We ended up having a huge rush, and it was difficult to get anything done when I had to spend most of my time filling customer orders.
		Being shorthanded really wasn&apos;t helping the situation, either.
		After a couple hours of not seeming to get anywhere, the other shift leader took charge, which was much appreciated.
		First of all, it&apos;s hard to lead while also getting stuck dealing with customers.
		You can&apos;t monitor what&apos;s going on as well, and you also can&apos;t do what you need to to act on what you do see.
		If possible, the main leader for the shift shouldn&apos;t be working a register.
		Secondly, I&apos;m not a morning crew person.
		I wish I was.
		But I&apos;m not.
		I don&apos;t remember how mornings are run, and even if I did, it&apos;s been so long since I consistently worked morning shifts that things have drastically changed since then, and what I&apos;d remember if I remembered much would be wrong.
		This other shift leader, being one of the normal morning shift leaders, has a much better idea of what needs to happen.
		Things calmed once more employees arrived though.
		Missing two out of three (and later four) employees got us off to a rough start, and we made things work when we were missing two out of six, but two out of larger numbers wasn&apos;t so big of a deal.
	</p>
	<p>
		The head manager said our labour to profit ratio for last month was great.
		I wonder if it helped that we were short employees on our busiest day of the year.
		We didn&apos;t have to pay as many people, but we still worked as hard as needed to get the job done, as we do every year.
		Or now that I think of it, simply having the busiest day of the year be a part of last month would have given us a huge advantage last month over other months.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been thinking for several days about how to make materials renewable in a way that doesn&apos;t change the game too drastically.
		I don&apos;t want to change game play that much, but I also don&apos;t want to be stuck trying to conserve every little thing, not using things to their fullest usefulness due to not wanting to use them up and having them gone forever.
		I also want to tie the renewal mechanic into the levelling system somehow.
		Not changing the game much and adding a new way to obtain items, while also taking the levelling system into account, is a major puzzle.
		How in the world do I accomplish all three things?
	</p>
	<p>
		For a couple days, I&apos;ve been toying with the idea of making an outer wilds area.
		Anything outside the bounds of a particular cube gets deleted, and thus gets regenerated.
		The cube would be huge, far larger than the space I&apos;d ever need.
		I might not even ever use it for materials, as honestly, my cube would have more than all the materials I&apos;d ever need.
		However, it&apos;d be there, telling me I couldn&apos;t possibly run out of material, so I could use whatever I like for whatever it can be used for.
		Today though, I noticed that that plan doesn&apos;t take into account the levelling system at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, I found what I think is a working solution.
		Similar to the shop idea I had before, you can sell things to an in-inventory shop.
		I think only seeds, saplings, and spores will be sellable though.
		You can only sell things that are used to regenerate other materials.
		Each one is worth a single credit.
		There&apos;s only one buyable item though: a &quot;reset bomb&quot;.
		Reset bombs can only be placed where their range doesn&apos;t hit other people&apos;s protected areas.
		They delete map blocks, so those blocks have to be regenerated.
		And their price is astronomical.
		To get just one, you have to pay the maximum level, plus one, minus your current level.
		The maximum level is hard-coded, based on my set-up, as it doesn&apos;t make sense to change the base price based on what mods you have installed.
		That means two elements with a maximum level of 65535 are factored in, adding quite a lot to the price.
	</p>
	<p>
		This renewal method accomplishes several things.
		First, everything is technically renewable, so I feel fine using materials more freely, but renewal is still so prohibitively expensive that it&apos;s easier just to get materials the normal way.
		Second, it doesn&apos;t place nodes in places they&apos;re not normally allowed to be.
		One thing I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever mentioned is how when I built mods that spawned element-dropping nodes in the world or allowed them to enter your inventory so you could place them anywhere you liked, I didn&apos;t like that it allowed things to be put where they could never normally be, as digging up those nodes to move them wouldn&apos;t drop the nodes themselves, so you couldn&apos;t place them elsewhere.
		Having my mod put element-dropping nodes out of place never quite felt right, but I couldn&apos;t think of a way to detect where these nodes should be allowed to show up.
		If it&apos;s the map generator putting them in place though, it&apos;s going to put them were it put them the first time, most likely.
		Third, levels make obtaining the bombs easier, so levels serve a purpose.
		Yay!
		Fourth, no oddball constructions are disallowed.
		For example, in one mod, I made snow blocks that are near water soak up the water and freeze into solid ice.
		This means you can&apos;t build out of snow near water, as the water will wreck your snow.
		I always felt a bit odd about that, too.
		But that doesn&apos;t happen with the bombs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I haven&apos;t experimented just yet.
		There are things I just don&apos;t know about the function&apos;s implementation, as I&apos;ve never used <code>minetest.delete_area()</code> before.
		The <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> documentation says it deletes map blocks, not individual nodes.
		If an area is specified that doesn&apos;t directly line up with block borders, what happens?
		Does the function round to the nearest border?
		Does it always round smaller, to delete less than you asked to be deleted, but not delete anything you didn&apos;t want deleted?
		Does it delete more, just to make sure everything you wanted gone is gone, at the expense of potentially wiping something nearby that you wanted to keep?
		Regeneration is an issue too.
		This supposedly deletes blocks.
		But the map is generated in chunks.
		A block is 16<sup>3</sup> nodes, and a chunk is <var>x</var><sup>3</sup> blocks, with <code>x</code> being based on a <code>minetest.conf</code> setting and defaulting to five.
		Does the whole chunk get regenerated on top of whatever parts of it hadn&apos;t been deleted?
		Or does the call to <code>minetest.delete_area()</code> actually delete up to the chunk, not just the selected blocks?
		These are things I&apos;ll need to find out through experimentation before actually building the mod.
	</p>
	<p>
		There&apos;s also something to note about the way chunks are generated normally, which won&apos;t work right when you delete stuff.
		As the map generates, it&apos;s allowed to extend structures one block into neighbouring chunks, whether those chunks have been generated yet or not.
		And if they haven&apos;t, the nodes that extend into these areas get saved in the now-partly-generated blocks.
		It&apos;s for this reason that things such as trees and dungeons don&apos;t get cut off at chunk borders.
		There&apos;s probably some flag set to indicate that these blocks are incomplete, but I don&apos;t know for sure.
		The point is though that when I delete these blocks, that data of nodes that came from neighbouring chunks will be lost.
		That lack of cutoff?
		Yeah, that&apos;ll only happen outward from the regenerated block (or full regenerated chunk, if that&apos;s what the map generator&apos;s going to do), not also inward from the neighbouring blocks.
		It&apos;s less than ideal, though honestly, I think it&apos;ll do a lot of good.
		I think it&apos;s the best renewal idea I&apos;ve had yet, though I also think most people would disagree and call it one of my worst ideas.
