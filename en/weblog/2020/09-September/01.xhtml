	<h2>Platform cart</h2>
	<p>
		I bought a platform cart today.
		The wagons I saw looked like they took up too much space.
		The dollies that I thought would work well were too expensive.
		This platform cart is smaller than I&apos;d&apos;ve preferred, but it should both speed up the move and make it <strong>*immensely*</strong> easier.
		Tomorrow, if I&apos;m up for it, I&apos;ll bring a load to the storage unit.
		I would have taken a load today, but I stayed up last night doing laundry, so I didn&apos;t get up early enough.
		I estimate that on foot without a cart and taking at least one load per day, it would have taken me a month or two, at least, and I would have been in a continual state of physical exhaustion.
		I was completely drained yesterday when I went to work, and I only took a single load.
		I also still have red marks on my chest from damage done by the boxes.
		With the cart, I won&apos;t be so tired and the job should get done much quicker.

	<h2>Another power trip from the assistant manager</h2>
	<p>
		Last night, I wrote up the job board such that I&apos;d put down everyone&apos;s names and shift times, but not what jobs they&apos;d be doing.
		My intent was that as there&apos;s no pleasing the night assistant manager, that they&apos;d fill in the jobs so as to divvy them out the way they saw fit.
		That&apos;d be the thing that would give them the most freedom and choice, and they could line things up the way they wanted things to be and we could hopefully have a smooth day.
		I just wanted everyone to get through the day without unnecessary issues.
		However, one of the shift-leaders-in-training then went through and assigned all the jobs.
		That was fine.
		The assistant manager was still free to erase and alter the setup, even if the shift-leader-in-training or I had assigned jobs.
		I only even mention this so I can show both my intent and how the initial state of the board ended up before the assistant manager got there.
		Anyway, I was to work the drive-through, and they were to work central command.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I arrived at work, I found the two of us had had our places switched by the assistant manager.
		Other changes may or may not have been present; I hadn&apos;t had enough investment in the job board last night to notice anything beyond our two shifts to notice if anything else had been amended.
		I wasn&apos;t happy, but I did suspect such a thing might happen.
		Last time they unexpectedly didn&apos;t show up, they&apos;d written me in as central command.
		But when they didn&apos;t show, there was no problem.
		At first, I started preparing myself for more of the assistant manager&apos;s nonsense.
		They&apos;re only able to pull cause most of their havoc when they aren&apos;t in central command but insist on making the decisions anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		I soon noticed that they&apos;d started blasting their music in the back room, where they were washing dishes.
		Typically at our restaurant, the person working the drive-through register is additionally in charge of washing the dishes and cleaning the back room.
		Seeing this, I foolishly allowed myself to become at ease.
		I thought I understood the situation.
		They&apos;d put themself somewhere that they could blast their music without causing communication difficulties between the rest of us.
		That&apos;s all this was.
		They just wanted to rock out, not lash out.
		Their music was still way too loud, but it was contained.
		Nothing was going to go wrong today.
	</p>
	<p>
		As central command, I made sure everything was getting done, and I made sure everyone got their breaks on time.
		Except mine.
		There was a combination of reasons for this.
		First, we were too busy.
		I couldn&apos;t step away from my station.
		Second, there was nowhere good to break.
		We can&apos;t break in the kitchen.
		That&apos;s not sanitary.
		We can&apos;t break out in the lobby.
		Normally, we could, but with this pandemic going on, putting ourselves near the customers unnecessarily for an extended period of time would probably not be appreciated, considering social distancing efforts and all.
		Breaking in the restroom ironically wouldn&apos;t be restful at all.
		And that leaves only the back room.
		I wouldn&apos;t be able to get anything useful done on my laptop with the music blasting.
		There wouldn&apos;t be a point.
		Finally, I was, on some level, still wary.
		I was going to be on alert regardless, unable to actually get my computer work done even if I had a place to do it and unable to rest if I tried to simply not work on anything at all for that time.
		It just didn&apos;t benefit me any to take a break, and my time was better spent doing actual work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mostly, things were going well.
		The assistant manager had a small outburst at one point, but they&apos;ve got a history of outburts, and this one was incredibly mild for them.
		We&apos;d made it to home stretch.
		We had an hour and a half left.
		Nothing could get in the way now.
		Or so I thought.
		The assistant manager tried to send me on break.
		I declined, and they insisted.
		I brought up that it was a bit late for a break to even be meaningful at this point, as it&apos;d been six and a half hours now.
		Getting a first break at this point would just be a joke.
		I was fine, I felt fine, and I just wanted to keep working.
		There was only an hour and a half left.
		They pulled their boss card again, and a small argument ensued.
		I agreed to follow whatever order they gave, but made it clear in no uncertain terms that if this was their order, it could not be mistaken for anything besides what it was: another power trip on their part.
		No one was benefiting from this break, and they were actively causing harm by forcing it.
		Furthermore, they refuse to take breaks quite frequently, often while pissed off.
		I only refuse breaks rarely, and they&apos;re making a big deal about it.
		They ended up forcing me to take all three of my breaks for the day, consecutively.
		Wow.
		I&apos;ve been angry with the assistant manager because they managed to hurt me and still haven&apos;t even attempted to make amends.
		I&apos;d thought that while they likely didn&apos;t feel remorse on any serious level, that they&apos;d at least learned a lesson from their first power trip with me and that they weren&apos;t going to pull this stunt again.
		But no.
		I don&apos;t think they even accept the fact that the lesson is theirs to learn.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess I&apos;ll have to learn a lesson in their place then.
		Even before the shift-leader-in-training started trying to act as a mediator, I&apos;d long since let most of the tension out of things.
		Sure, I wasn&apos;t standing up for the shift leader against undeniably-true-but-negative comments, but I also went back to speaking with the assistant manager in an affable and cordial manner.
		Not this time.
		Formality all the way.
		This does not deflate unless they actually make the effort to make amends and deflate it themself.
		This does, of course, include following every order unquestioningly like they want, but also includes pointing out that they don&apos;t want my input when they ask for it.
		The thing is that even the very day they had their first power trip, they tried to go back to asking me permission to do certain things, including clock out and go home.
		If they&apos;re the boss and what I say is a moot point, why are they asking <strong>*my*</strong> permission to go home?
		They should be telling <strong>*me*</strong> when I can go home and/or when they&apos;re going home.
		It&apos;s worth noting, too, just for clarity, that they do this only when we&apos;re both scheduled to close the store.
		That means they&apos;re not off earlier than me or something, and asking because I&apos;m staying longer.
		They ask, then we both go home.
		The first couple times they did that, I pointed out that they&apos;re the boss, and it&apos;s not up to me to decide that for them.
		After that, I quickly just went back to letting them ask as that wasn&apos;t going anywhere.
		No such luck for them this time.
		I will do my best to bite my tongue and decline all invitations to provide unnecessary input.
		I will, of course, accurately provide the type of input that includes status reports and responses to similar queries, but any and all decision-making will be left to them.
		I will still instruct other people in ways I think will benefit the store as a whole and even the assistant manager.
		I&apos;m not in any way dumping that responsibility fully on the assistant manager.
		However, when directly speaking with the assistant manager, no choices will be made by me.
		No exceptions.
		They&apos;re not going to think things have gone back to normal until they actually put in an effort to make up for their actions.
		I think this time, they sort of did think things had at least mostly simmered down between us.
		On my end, they certainly hadn&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m told that while I was on my &quot;break&quot; - which consisted of me standing just outside the kitchen not getting any work done for half an hour spinning a countdown timer in my hand - the night assistant manager telephoned someone that was believed to be the day assistant manager and spoke with them for twenty minutes about me.
		Lovely.
		I&apos;m probably going to be in trouble.
		For a bit there, thinking about it made me consider handing in my manager shirt and keys, telling the head manager that I could either be demoted or I could leave entirely.
		The night assistant manager can&apos;t cause their damage to me when I&apos;m not in charge.
		Without my title and position, they ironically don&apos;t have as much power over me.
		It&apos;s like ... when I&apos;m not in central command, I&apos;m a blade of grass.
		The wind can blow all it likes, and it&apos;s not going to break me.
		But when I am, I&apos;m a tree.
		I have more strength, but more rigidity.
		I can do more, but I can also be broken.
		As my temper cooled a bit, I stopped wanting to throw the towel in right away.
		At this point, I still might ask for demotion or I walk if this turns into anything on any sort of level.
		If I get written up, for example, I think I might give up.
		If I get a stern talking-to though, and that&apos;s all, I&apos;ll keep going.
		I feel like I have to, for the time being.
	</p>
	<p>
		I feel like I&apos;m trapped here, and yet, I feel the toxicity of this place more than ever.
		I have to get out.
		The workmate that informed me of the call said that I was in the right.
		I told them it didn&apos;t matter who was in the right.
		They also said that if there was any trouble, they&apos;d stand up for me.
		I advised them not to do that.
		They don&apos;t need to get involved in the toxicity of this place any more than they have to.
		Besides, I honestly, I don&apos;t entirely blame the assistant manager for their toxicity.
		This noxious place pollutes good people and makes them noxious as well.
		I&apos;ve seen it happen to many employees.
		At this point though, I think the assistant manager has succumbed to it too far.
		There is no getting past this for them until they leave and have a chance to detoxify.
		They&apos;ve soaked up too much of this place&apos;s poison that they can&apos;t help but spill some of it back out on everyone else.
		The ultimate source of most of this is likely the franchise owner, though a bit clearly comes from corporate as well, and there are likely other sources as well adding to this cesspool, with few if any draining points.
		I&apos;m not sure how much longer it&apos;s wise to stick around.
		I need to get my living room cleared out.
		After that, even without my vocal therapy, I might start searching for a new job.
		It&apos;s less than ideal, but maybe that&apos;s the best thing I can do for my own mental stability.
		For now, I can only hope that I haven&apos;t started turning toxic as well.
		Perhaps this journal has allowed me to pour out enough of the toxicity I&apos;ve soaked up to avoid spilling it out on my actual, human workmates.

	<p>
		Today was one of those days in which I didn&apos;t even feel like playing - especially because of the huge, boring task I&apos;ve got to finish before I can do anything interesting and because I had other things to get done - but felt I had to anyway just to show progress for the day.
		I&apos;m hoping to hit the one-year mark of making progress in my world at least a little bit each day.
