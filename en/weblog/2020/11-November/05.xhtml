<section id="tubes">
	<h2>Punctured tubes</h2>
	<p>
		I lost another two inner tubes today.
		I can&apos;t figure out what&apos;s going on here!
		The first tube didn&apos;t puncture right away, and I&apos;ve been using it for a couple days at least.
		When it did puncture though, the hole was large enough to let all the air out pretty quickly.
		I re-examined the tire and found nothing, and when I inflated the punctured tube while it was in the wet tire, there was so much foam coming out of the cracks in the tires rubber on the side that I couldn&apos;t pinpoint where the puncture had occurred at on the tire.
		So I changed the tube, hoping it was a freak incident that just happened to be around the time of the other four punctured tubes, but still highly sceptical, I inflated the sixth tube without putting it on the bike first.
		This one punctured before I could finish inflating the tube, but this time, no foam got in the way and I found the exact point of puncture.
		It looks like the old hole I pulled the bit of rusted metal out of.
		There&apos;s nothing there now though.
		Examining the sixth tube, the puncture on the tube lines up exactly with this hole on the tire though.
		I&apos;m so confused.
		I&apos;d understand maybe something poking through that hole as I rode over it, puncturing the fifth tube.
		But the hole is empty now and it still seems to be the source of the sixth tube&apos;s puncture as well.
		I&apos;m at a loss as to the mechanics of how this sixth tube could possibly have gotten punctured.
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly, there&apos;s something sharp in the tire.
		And clearly, I can&apos;t find it.
		So I gave up, and swapped out the tire.
		The problematic tire&apos;s nearly thin enough that I would have changes it out anyway.
		So then I inflated the seventh tube, in the new tire.
		Quickly, I heard the hissing of escaping air.
		What now!?
		Was the problem the wheel and not the tire all along?
		But that didn&apos;t make sense; the hissing sound was coming from the wrong spot on the wheel.
		The location of the hole was different on this tire.
		Pulling the tube out, I found that this time, one of my patches had failed and was peeling off.
		I probably didn&apos;t apply that one quite correctly.
		It was my own error and not a problem with the wheel or tire.
		As I inflated the seventh tube though, I heard another hiss.
		Following it, I found the tire had come out of the wheel and the air was escaping through that.
		Hoping the air was leaving the tire but not the tube, I deflated the tube enough to get the tire back in, the started again.
		The hissing resumed, so I figured I&apos;d caused a probably-good patch job to rupture due to inflating the tube without the tire properly restraining its expansion.
		After removing the tube though, I couldn&apos;t find anywhere air was escaping, so I tried the same tube again, this time being more careful about the tire&apos;s location as I inflated the tube.
		This time, it seemed to hold air just fine.
		Odd.

<section id="donation">
	<h2>Donation for a discount</h2>
	<p>
		I received an email telling me that my storage complex is offering a ten percent discount on next month&apos;s rent to anyone who brings in a food donation for the local food bank by November 29.
		I immediately decided I&apos;d calculate the discount, then buy enough canned food to spend the discount, and donate all of it.
		It&apos;d make the discount pointless for me and actually cost me more in time, but I&apos;d find it hilarious and the food bank would benefit from it.
		But after checking how much my rent was, I realised how little ten percent is.
		It&apos;d just be $7.80 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>, which could buy maybe a dozen cans if I was lucky and hit a sale.
		What a pitiful donation, compared to the box or so of cans I&apos;d imagined donating at first!
		I entered my kitchen while still thinking about it though and realised I have several canned and dry goods I don&apos;t really have a use for.
		I picked them up because they were gratis, but I don&apos;t know what to do with them.
		I&apos;d just donate those next time my father and I took a load over.
		Except that we go on the weekends and the office isn&apos;t open then, so I ended up going today, instead.
		I&apos;d planned to go out and get inner tube patches today, but I made this my outing for the day instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried loading it all up into my backpack, but found it didn&apos;t have enough space.
		I ended up bringing a few cans in my purse, too.
		How privileged in life am I that I have this much food lying around that I don&apos;t even plan on eating?
		Sure, I suffer from crippling depression for the time being, but I&apos;m not going to starve to death any time soon.
		If I were desperate at any time, I could have dipped into these odd things such as canned pumpkin and dried beans and lentils.
		Actually, the dry goods would be rather useful if I didn&apos;t have so much lethargy keeping me from planning ahead enough to get them soaked overnight before using them.
		Anyway, I someone more desperate than I can make use of them, and I ended up donating nearly as much as I&apos;d imagined, just mostly not in canned goods, but dry goods instead.

<section id="patches">
	<h2>Inner tube patches</h2>
	<p>
		On my way back from dropping off over a backpack worth of canned food and dried food, I tried to snap my daily photograph.
		I found that - likely due to the trouble my camera was giving me when I was trying to deal with yesterday&apos;s photographs today - I&apos;d left the camera&apos;s <abbr title="Secure Digital">SD</abbr> card in my laptop and couldn&apos;t take any photographs.
		Ugh.
		So I could bike back to the storage complex to get the photo I&apos;d intended to take, or I could take today&apos;s photo elsewhere in a second outing.
		I decided to make better use of my time and go out for the inner tube patches I&apos;d originally intended to buy today.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was sort of done being outside and it had started raining, so I just couldn&apos;t be bothered to bike all the way to my preferred bike shop for the patches if I didn&apos;t have to.
		I took a stop at the closer bike shop, figuring there was a pretty good chance they were still not servicing customers that don&apos;t have telephone service, but it was worth a shot.
		It turns out they&apos;re open for regular business now though, so I bought $20 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> worth of patches there.
		That&apos;s twenty-four patches.
		That should last a while, hopefully.
		It&apos;s annoying and frustrating to have to go out for inner tube patches when you&apos;re out of working inner tubes and out of patches to fix them with.
		A litter pre-preparation goes a long way, and at the moment, I still had several spare tubes and one patch.

		I built the cores for most of the bridge supports out to the east; all the ones up to the island there.
		I&apos;ll need to dig out the tunnel through that island to finish the rest of them though.
