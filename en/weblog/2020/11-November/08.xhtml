	<h2>Storage</h2>
	<p>
		Today my father and I took the last of my mother&apos;s junk to the storage unit!
		Well, mostly.
		A couple spools of ribbon fell from one of the ribbon racks I was carrying.
		I retrieved them on the way home, but they&apos;ll need to be taken over to the storage unit later.
		I&apos;m probably just going to pop them into my purse the day I head over to pay rent later this month, and drop them off then.
		Also, there&apos;s the furniture.
		I&apos;m probably going to leave that about where it is for now - some of it being in the middle of the room though - until I&apos;ve gotten a bit more organised.
		Then I&apos;ll move it all into the study nook, where much of my own stuff was crammed to make space for hers.

	<h2>Gifts from my father</h2>
	<p>
		My father brought me two very nice gifts today.
		One was an old digital camera that he no longer uses.
		My camera&apos;s been giving me trouble, so maybe this one will function better.
		He says it&apos;s probably very outdated, but it&apos;s a much nicer camera than what I&apos;ve been using, and I really don&apos;t need anything too fancy.
		I need to be able to turn the resolution way down for Web-quality photographs, which is an option this camera does have.
		Low resolution is a pretty old feature though.
		It&apos;s high-resolution photographs that you need modern cameras for.
		The resolution keeps getting higher and higher, I think.
		I&apos;m pretty sure old and new cameras alike handle low-rez photos pretty similarly.
		I guess low-light and anti-glare are newer features that apply to even low-rez photos though.
		I&apos;m guessing this camera does better than my junky one.
		It does have the disadvantage that I can&apos;t seem to figure out how to get it to display the date and time on photographs though.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other gift was a broken-down bicycle.
		From the sounds of it, it&apos;s really not salvageable.
		One of the peddles won&apos;t stay on because of stripped threads, and you can&apos;t really exchange cranks between bikes so well.
		It had working tires though.
		That&apos;ll save me quite a bit of money, I think, and he was just going to bring the thing to a scrapyard anyway.
	</p>

<section id="bicycle">
	<h2>Bicycle repair</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve swapped in one of the broken bike&apos;s tires onto the the less-broken bike that&apos;s been eating up all my inner tubes.
		I was actually able to bike to work today, which was unexpected.
		I used the bike&apos;s original wheel, as planned.
		If another inner tube bursts pretty soon, I&apos;m going to have to assume the problem is the wheel, even though I can&apos;t find the problem.
		I have so many scrap wheels at this point that I can probably find at least one that fits.
		I still have only that one spare inner tube though, unless the inner tubes from the scrap bike will work.
		They&apos;ve got a different valve type than my other inner tubes, and I&apos;m not sure if my bike pump will work with them.
		I&apos;m too exhausted to check right now.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of the bike pump, I think it&apos;s breaking.
		Joy.
		Normally, it registers zero pressure when not hooked up to a tube or when hooked up to an empty tube.
		Now, it&apos;s registering 200 <abbr title="kilopascal">kPa</abbr> when no pressure aside from the ambient pressure in the room is present.
		I&apos;m not sure if the gage is broken or if there&apos;s some sort of clog in the line that&apos;s honestly keeping the pressure within the pump higher than it should be when not in use.
		The thing has had frequent clogging problems, so I wouldn&apos;t rule either out.
		I&apos;m honestly not sure what&apos;s been clogging it, either, but it gets so jammed up that I can&apos;t pump any air at all until I really lay on the plunger as hard as I can while the pump isn&apos;t attached to the inner tube to unjam it before use.

	<p>
		I thought I had an epiphany and that I&apos;d overlooked something big that would make the equation I&apos;m trying to create in order to get level predictions up and running easier than I&apos;d thought it&apos;d be.
		I thought what I was trying to solve for was wrong, and a much simpler equation was actually needed.
		The equation I was trying to produce was simply wrong and would produce invalid results anyway.
		As it turned out though, I ended up just reinventing the equation I already have for extrapolating per-material levels, when what I need now is one for extrapolating total levels.
		I&apos;m actually no closer to solving that than I was before.
