	<h2>Voting</h2>
	<p>
		I intended to set up an <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> appointment today, but I couldn&apos;t find the email address in my inbox.
		At least I got my voting done today though.
		Do you know what would be even worse than Having Donald Trump running our country for another four years as president?
		Having my state end up voting for him in a close election in which he won but would have lost if my state had voted for someone else and my having not worked up the energy to get my vote submitted and thus being a part of <strong>*how*</strong> he kept the presidency for another term.
		I just don&apos;t think I could take that.
		By voting for Joe Biden, his biggest opponent in this election, I can be free of that guilt.
		I&apos;m not actively promoting him or speaking out against Trump like I&apos;d like to do, but I just don&apos;t have the energy to do so given my situation.
		That one vote is all I can work myself up to get done on that front, and that&apos;s terrible, but I think it&apos;s the best I can do right now, and because of that, as long as my state votes for Biden and I&apos;ve submitted my vote, I feel like I&apos;ve done what I&apos;m obligated to do.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve been trying for a few days to figure out what I want the tunnels for the main road to look like.
		Previously, the main road had a pine-and-snow theme, so the tunnels did as well.
		If I switched the theme of the tunnels to match the road&apos;s bridges, I feared I wouldn&apos;t be able to figure out how to make them at all interesting.
		With the pine theme, it was easy to add in pine logs as structural supports every so often to break up the monotony.
		However, the stone theme I&apos;m using for the bridges has deliberately haphazard placement of the various stone textures.
		The shape of the bridge is quite deliberate and uniform, but that doesn&apos;t lend itself well to a tunnel style that would have any sort of supports.
		My only ideas, for a while, were to either have the tunnel have no shaped depth or to have the stone textures in the tunnel not be matchingly haphazard and instead use stone bricks for the walls and stone blocks for the pillars.
		Neither seemed like it&apos;d look all that great.
		Today though, I arrived at a style I think will look alright.
		The walls, floor, and ceiling of the tunnel will be built from the haphazard stone.
		I&apos;ll have wooden supports in the tunnel too though, which will be pine logs, as they&apos;re the only logs available to me during my stay in World&apos;s Navel.
		A plain, unprocessed stone (as opposed to cobble, stone block, or stone brick) boarder will sit at the mouths of the tunnel.
		I think that&apos;ll look rather decent.
		If not, I can try to figure out what changes to make.
		I won&apos;t make any progress without trying something though.
	</p>
	<p>
		For now, I&apos;m just working on the cores of the bridge supports from the four cardinal directions.
		I want the tunnel at Original Isle done, but I feel like it&apos;d be much easier to get the centre right if I could easily come at it from all four directions, using the bridges to line up where the tunnel mouths need to be.
		Additionally, I&apos;ve got a lot of silver sand and flint I don&apos;t want taking up space in my chests right now, and getting the bridges done requires me to lay out the material for the ocean floor.
		It just make the most sense to work with the bridges for the time being.
