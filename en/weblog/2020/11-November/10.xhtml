		I think this new-to-me camera takes better photographs than my old one, and in particular, has less glare.
		Having better-quality photographs for my journal is nice.

		I&apos;ve been contemplating my ideas from yesterday; in particular, the one for tracking worn tools.
		While I think it&apos;s a very good idea, I don&apos;t think it goes well with my particular play style.
		The problem becomes very clear when you take a look at how <code>liblevelup</code> has influenced my relationship with ocean sand.
		I now destroy every bit of ocean sand I can just for the meaningless points <code>liblevelup</code> gives me for doing so.
		Try applying that to tool wear.
		It becomes obvious that I&apos;d put all my diamonds, copper, tin, mese, and iron toward tools, as well as much stone and wood.
		This is a bit of a problem.
		Diamonds, tin, and copper wouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem, but mese and iron would be.
		It means no materials for rails, for example, and no mese lights for underwater sand-harvesting.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the idea of making artificial diamonds and the like out of other drops, it doesn&apos;t seem like a step up from my current strategy of just making tools out of mushrooms.
		Either way, it throws off the balance of what I&apos;d otherwise be collecting and lets me pour thousands of mushrooms I otherwise wouldn&apos;t have a good reason to grow into something I&apos;m deriving benefit from.
		While I was out biking today though, I realised I was repeating a mistake from the past: setting contradictory goals.
		This is exactly the mistake that caused the <code>minequest</code> project to fall through.
		I&apos;m trying to avoid throwing off the resource-collection balance this time though.
		I&apos;m also trying to eliminate the need for consuming non-renewable resources though, which itself is a part of the balance I&apos;m trying to avoid upsetting!
		There are a number of approaches I can take here.
		First, I can eliminate the need at all, rather than redirecting it elsewhere.
		In other words, I can either eliminate tool wear or eliminate tools altogether.
		As someone that did that in a past iteration of my game world, I can tell you that that&apos;s not as fun as it sounds.
		Besides, the balance is still thrown off, due to the lack of a consuming need to perpetually hunt diamonds.
		Second, I could make the player decide where to shift the load diamonds once bore by creating a number of tool sets, one for each major resource.
		That seems needlessly complicated, with a bunch of functionally-identical tool sets present, differing only aesthetically and compatibility-wise.
		Honestly, it seems kind of crazy.
		Third, I could create a sort of &quot;junk nugget&quot; item that can be crafted from any combination of a number of pre-selected items related to the pool of resources I want the load redirected to.
		Again, the player could select where to redirect the load, but they could also split up the load, so that could be nice.
		I don&apos;t think I like the idea though, due to the bizarre and inconsistent composition of the nuggets.
		And finally, my last option is to select a place to redirect the load myself and build a mod that does just that.
		That last option is exactly what <code>mushroom_tools</code> already does, and I&apos;ve been exceedingly happy with it aside from the fact that it does throw off the resource-collection balance, but so does <strong>*every other option besides continuing to use up finite resources*</strong>, which I like even less.
		Going with this fourth option of my choosing where relief from diamonds&apos; load gets redirected, I pretty much have a spectrum of options here.
		On one end, I can redirect that load to items that are already very useful.
		That increases the already-large demand for those items.
		On the other end, I could redirect that load to items that are nearly useless, such as mushrooms.
		Tat would add load to an item that didn&apos;t have much load previously.
		Honestly, I like that last option better, and it&apos;s what I already have in place.
		I just need to get myself back to being happy about what I already built.
		It&apos;s actually rather decent, and short of fixing the lack of renewability, I doubt any solution I come up with will even close to measure up to the solution that <code>mushroom_tools</code> provides.
