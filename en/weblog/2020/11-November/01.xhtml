<section id="idiocy">
	<h2>Daylight Saving Time</h2>
	<p>
		I woke up today and almost immediately accidentally unplugged my laptop.
		As mentioned previously, my laptop&apos;s battery gave out, so when it gets unplugged, it not only shuts off, but forgets what time it is, and even what the date is.
		That was rather irritating as always.
		That issue was compounded by another though: idiotic Daylight Saving Time.
		I was told that Daylight Saving Time was gone forever in my state.
		It turns out it isn&apos;t, and my laptop that kept the real time just lost it, so I had to go with my alarm clock&apos;s time, which isn&apos;t aware of Daylight Saving Time.
		I ended up waiting about an hour after I thought my father was showing up, and almost gave up on his arrival and just headed out without him.
	</p>
	<p>
		As it turns out, people claiming that Daylight Saving Time was over jumped the gun.
		There&apos;s a bill that passed in our state that would get rid of these idiotic clock changes, but it has two issues.
		First, all three United States states in my time zone have to pass similar bills or the bill in my state doesn&apos;t take effect.
		The intent is that all three states continue to be on the same clock.
		And secondly, the national congress has to - after all three states are on board - approve the change.
		I can&apos;t say I&apos;m particularly opposed to either requirement, assuming all three states are planning to make the change and given the federal requirements.
		The real problem is that people were prematurely announcing that Daylight Saving Time was over without actually admitting that it was only over if certain requirements got met in time, and they weren&apos;t.
		So it&apos;ll continue until said requirements are met or indefinitely if the bill expires first.
		Celebrations of Daylight Saving Time being abolished were by far premature!
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems Washington is on board.
		California wants to be on-board but their bill got delayed for the time being.
		As for the federal requirements, it seems that the federal government began mandating the use of Daylight Saving Time a while back.
		We, as a state, aren&apos;t allowed to break that mandate unless we can get an exception.
		I think once all three state are asking for such an exception, we can get it.
		We won&apos;t even be the only states that have such an exemption.
		That said, I&apos;m not sure why the federal government would force the entire country to engage in this idiocy in the first place.
		It&apos;s both arbitrary and asinine, so given that they <strong>*did*</strong> put this requirement in place, I wouldn&apos;t put it past them not to deny our request of an exception.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can&apos;t believe though that we&apos;re not done with this nonsense after all though ...

	<p>
		I was reading today and came across a piece about the importance of gaming for gamers.
		It made several good points, but in particular, it mentioned stress relief and use as a coping mechanism.
		I&apos;m overloaded with stress most of the time.
		Minetest fills a special role for me.
		I&apos;m easily addicted to certain types of games to the point that they become incredibly unhealthy for me.
		Other games, I can&apos;t even stay interested in.
		Minetest is a good combination of not being addictive for me but also always having more that can be done in it.
		And when things aren&apos;t fun in Minetest, I can usually mod them away.
		I&apos;m not sure giving up Minetest is healthy for me while school is in session.
		For the break, it&apos;s just a hobby, but when school is in session, Minetest is a huge part of how I keep what sanity I do manage not to lose.
		Anyway, I&apos;m going back to the <code>mushroom_tools</code> way of doing things.
		It&apos;s simple.
		It works.
		I really enjoy it.
		Who even cares if it results in huge amounts of cobble to find a place for?
		It&apos;s not even like I mind working with stone.
		I just thought that I&apos;d sort of causes myself to gain an undue excess of the stuff and thought that it might not be fair.
		Who even cares if it&apos;s fair though?
		It&apos;s a big part of how I make it through quite a few of my days.
		Anyway, I was reluctant to throw out my <code>mushroom_tools</code> world as I wasn&apos;t sure <code>runes</code> would really work out anyway.
		It didn&apos;t work out, so I&apos;m going back.
		No need to even start from scratch.

<section id="addiction">
	<h2>Game addiction</h2>
	<p>
		Since I brought up how easily I become addicted to certain types of games, I thought it might be nice to discuss what types of games those would be.
		I doubt many people, if any, reading this would be super concerned, but it can be a bit annoying to read something so vague with no explanation, so this might clear up someone&apos;s idle curiosity.
		The main type of game I used to get addicted to was games with limited time events.
		These toxic games cause you to permanently miss out if you put the game down for a any real length of time.
		It&apos;s their way of making sure you stay engaged.
		Forever, if they can help it.
		And it&apos;s really effective on me.
		Fortunately, since I gave up proprietary software, I&apos;ve never run into such a game again.
		This particular type of toxic game simply can&apos;t work in the free software world, because you could just edit the source code and bring the event back at any point you wanted to.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another type of game that I wouldn&apos;t label as outright toxic or deliberately malicious is games in which different things are available at different times of day, of the week, or of the year based on real-world time.
		I&apos;ve not encountered these in the free software world myself, but I could see such games being implemented.
		There probably already are some if you know where to look.
		If I&apos;m having to play the game at specific times though, not when I&apos;m actually needing some game time, it&apos;s rather unhealthy for my type.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is one type of game I find very addictive though that I <strong>*have*</strong> encountered in the free software world: idle games.
		Idle games have the characteristic that you really should leave them running even when not actively engaging with them.
		<Strong>*Especially*</Strong> when not engaging with them.
		Having them running in the background leaves me obsessively checking them though, trying to spend whatever resources become available as soon as I notice them, so as to make the idling time that follows even more productive.
		You&apos;re rewarded for sitting and doing nothing.
		But you&apos;re rewarded even <strong>*more*</strong> for optimising your setup as early as possible.
		These games are incredibly unhealthy for me personally, and I should avoid getting sucked into one at all costs.
		Don&apos;t get me wrong, such games have a valid place in the world.
		Not everyone responds to the same stimuli in the same way though, and you should always keep in mind your own weaknesses when engaging with a game.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another type of game that&apos;s been really unhealthy for me in the past is those stupid daily-streak-type games.
		You can&apos;t miss even a single day or you have to start entirely over in your progress.
		For me, I need the sort of game that you can put down indefinitely and everything stays the same.
		If I close the Minetest application, for example, it no longer has a concept of time passing.
		Time just stops dead in its tracks.
		If you play on a server, life goes on and other players still make changes to the game world, but there&apos;s no inherent penalty for taking a break.
		Minetest isn&apos;t built to coerce or guilt you into regular activity.
		You can engage in Minetest activity regularly (as I tend to) if you want to; you don&apos;t feel like you <strong>*need*</strong> to.
