	<h2><abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> contribution</h2>
	<p>
		Yesterday, when looking for the email address of the financial consultant from my credit union so I could email them about making an appointment, I tried using the search feature for two different domains I thought the email address might be attached to as well as what I thought I remembered their surname was.
		No results turned up.
		Today, before heading out to try to make the appointment in person, I remembered I might still have their business card in my wallet, so I tried that.
		Sure enough, the business card was there.
		I had their surname correct, their surname was in their email address, and one of my domain guesses was also correct.
		I&apos;m not sure why no emails came up matching my search queries.
		Odd.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was already going to go out pretty soon and be in the area, so an in-person appointment would be easier, but if I recall, the people in-branch just gave me the financial consultant&apos;s email address and told me to make an appointment that way.
		So no point trying in-person if I&apos;ve got the email address.
		I sent the email requesting an appointment, and I received pretty quickly an automated reply informing me that that investment consultant is no longer employed there, and to try sending my email to a different email address, I reworded a bit and tried that.
		A couple people responded from different email addresses, and one set up an appointment with me on 2020-11-11 at 11:00.

	<p>
		I finished the cores of the bridge supports coming in from the south.
		At this point, it&apos;d be safe to move into the dungeon out south if I wanted to, as it&apos;s now visually obvious where the bridge will be, even though it&apos;s nowhere near usable yet.
		That said, moving to the dungeon would be inconvenient due to the inability to set my spawn point there just yet.
		I still don&apos;t have the cotton needed to make a bed.
