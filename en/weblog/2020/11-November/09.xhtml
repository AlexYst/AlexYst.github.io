	<h2><strong>*I&apos;M UP TO TEN BROKEN INNER TUBES NOW!!*</strong></h2>
	<p>
		Last night, the eighth inner tube broke on me.
		My workmate wanted to look at the wheel after work to see if they could see anything wrong with it, but by th eend of the night, they&apos;d decided they&apos;d rather look at in in the daylight tomorrow.
		I&apos;d already discussed that the current tube was broken though.
		I&apos;d also mentioned that I was going to swap out the wheel this time too.
		Obviously, I would change it out tonight or tomorrow morning before work and there&apos;d no longer be anything left to look at.
		Of course, I&apos;m far too tired of all this to deal with it right away, so I was actually going to just try using the broken inner tube until it became bad enough to require me to deal with the issue.
		I wanted to point out the obvious logic part to my workmate though, so I pointed out how I&apos;d need to change it tonight and that because I was swapping in the new wheel, there&apos;d no longer be anything left to look at.
		Besides, problem solved, anyway.
		The tube has been changed out repeatedly, the tire has been changed out twice, and now the wheel was getting changed out.
		There was nothing left that could be causing the problem, so the problem would be over tomorrow.
		Instead, the worst happened: they told me to bring in the wheel tomorrow.
		Great.
		I&apos;d practically promised the wheel would be off and easy to inspect by tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		So tonight, I took off the wheel and changed out the tube, as it&apos;d be stupid to use the broken inner tube in the new wheel knowing it was already broken.
		I&apos;d wanted to put off changing the tube a while so I wouldn&apos;t be completely out of spare tube in case the next one broke
		Because I wasn&apos;t able to wait and let the hole get bigger, I can&apos;t even find the hole yet, so that&apos;s frustrating - I can&apos;t even patch that tube because the hole isn&apos;t big enough to let air escape fast enough to find, even with the tube submerged in water.
		I&apos;m going to end up having to use it again anyway later without repairing it first.
		And, exactly as I&apos;d wanted to avoid doing, I ended up having to use up my last spare tube.
		I tried the tubes from the broken bike, but the valve type on those tubes isn&apos;t one of the two types my bike pump can handle.
	</p>
	<p>
		So anyway, I put the ninth tube onto the new wheel.
		It immediately broke.
		What is even the Squid-damn problem here‽
		The tube has been swapped out repeatedly, so the tube isn&apos;t the problem.
		The tire has been swapped out.
		The wheel has now been swapped out.
		Nothing else is touching the inner tube!
		Nothing else should be able to quickly and so-consistently break all the inner tubes!
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up staying up and patching all my inner tubes again, aside form the one I can&apos;t find the hole in.
		I swapped in the tenth inner tube, didn&apos;t put the wheel on the bike, and inflated it.
		I let it sit overnight, and it had deflated by morning.
		Over several hours, it&apos;ll deflate, but it holds air well enough to get to work on.
	</p>
	<p>
		I brought the original wheel to work because I didn&apos;t want to deal with my workmate telling me I should have brought it in anyway if I didn&apos;t, but I didn&apos;t see a point in looking at it.
		Two unrelated wheels were used.
		Three tires.
		Several inner tubes.
		The problem was happening even when the bike wasn&apos;t touching the wheel.
		There were no parts shared between all instances of the tube punctures, and there was always (aside from on that one tube I didn&apos;t patch correctly and the one tube that wasn&apos;t allowed to let the problem grow) a clean and very visible puncture hole, showing there to be an outside cause and not some defect in every tube I touch.
		There are no common denominator parts, but the symptoms point to there being a common problem.
		Examining the wheel would do nothing, as the wheel wasn&apos;t even present for all cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turned out my workmate was specifically checking for a spoke that&apos;d come lose from the wheel and was poking into the rim, which was not only a problem I checked for, but also a problem I&apos;d specifically and repeatedly confirmed with them that I&apos;d checked for.
		I guess they didn&apos;t believe me or didn&apos;t think I knew what I was talking about, so that was pointless.
		There&apos;s nothing they could have told me then, regardless of what the problem is.

	<h2>Victory!</h2>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t have the energy to deal with following the new these days, but I did check in on the presidential election.
		It seems Jo Biden won.
		Yay!
		Really, I&apos;d be happy with anyone but Trump, at this point.
		I don&apos;t know much about Biden, honestly, but he&apos;s got to be better than that literal conman, bigot, misogynist, white supremacist, and massive idiot, Trump.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I finished processing all the pine needles I&apos;s stored in chests back before I had a mushroom sword with which to convert them into saplings.
		That was annoying.
		I really should have gone after the brown mushroom before building the towers so I could have processed the needles as I&apos;d originally collected them instead of having to do it later as a separate process.
	</p>
	<p>
		I came up with a number of ideas today.
		First, the concept of &quot;ware gems&quot;.
		When you wear out your tool, it breaks into one or more gems that can be used to enhance other tools.
		When you repair a tool, you either get the gems from one of those tools right away or it strengthens the eventual gems of the combined tool if it breaks.
		Most likely, I&apos;d go with the former, so as to avoid requiring players to eventually break their tool if they wanted any gems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, a new mod that tracks how many tools to craft, break, repair properly, and wastefully repair.
		This mod would have some interesting consequences.
		Like <code>liblevelup</code>, this mod would cement which stats were canonical to my mods.
		A <code>retrotools</code> mod would need to be built to restore lost tool-crafting recipes such as those for upper-tier hoes, and eventually restore tools that were removed from the game altogether.
		Additionally, such a canonical set would exclude the tools defined by <code>mushroom_tools</code>, so that mod would need to go.
		Mushroom Fork&apos;s fork would become a misnomer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, another thing I considered was some sort of synthetic, tool-grade materials that can be manufactured.
		For example, tool-grade diamonds might be crafted from various renewable materials, and these diamonds would be craftable into tools, but not nodes.
		The same would go for other non-renewable materials used for crafting tools.
