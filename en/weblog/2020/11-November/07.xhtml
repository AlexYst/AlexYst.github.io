<section id="storage">
	<h2>Storage</h2>
	<p>
		We managed to get everything moved to the storage unit aside from the furniture and some awkward but items.
		I&apos;m probably just going to leave the furniture here and put it off in the study nook, out of the way.
		The light-wight stuff can be brought to the storage unit tomorrow, and I can start getting my home back in order.
		This is fantastic!
	</p>

<section id="tube">
	<h2>Popped inner tube</h2>
	<p>
		As I was headed out to work, I noticed my back tire was pretty low on air again.
		Lovely.
		I didn&apos;t have time to deal with the issue though, and just filled it back up.
		When I left work though, I couldn&apos;t even get a single block before my inner tube burst with a loud pop.
		This is at least the seventh broken inner tube now!
		What the Squid is going on here‽
		The tube has been changed out.
		Six times.
		The tire has been changed out too.
		That leaved the wheel itself.
		I examined that previously and found nothing, but it&apos;s the only common factor in all seven broken inner tubes.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wrestled off the wheel and took out the inner tube when I got home to diagnose.
		I have ... mixed feelings about what I&apos;m seeing.
		It took a while to find the breach, but when I did, it was a big slit.
		I guess that&apos;d be more likely than yet another puncture hole for such a loud pop.
		I still can&apos;t find anything wrong with the wheel though, aside from the broken spoke that I removed already and wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve impacted the inner tube anyway.
		I&apos;m also sort of wondering if there&apos;s a new cause this time.
		The tire, while it claims to be the same size as the last one, is easier to get on an off of the wheel and it sits looser than I&apos;m used to.
		When the tube isn&apos;t inflated carefully, the tire can end up mispositioned and not tight around the inner tube.
		That could explain why the sudden pop.
		That said, the slit this time is almost directly across from the patches on that same tire if the tube is folded at the point of the valve stem.
		Y&apos;know, exactly where you&apos;d expect the problem to be if the problem was on the wheel itself and the tube had been put in backwards from how it&apos;d previously been put in, which would easily happen unnoticed because the things are reversible.
		That&apos;s incredibly suspicious.
		And now that I think on it, the fact that the tubes always break at that same sot is also suspicious, and doesn&apos;t point to a tire problem as all as the tire could end up put on at any of an infinite number of angles each time, which would prevent a tire issue from causing the inner tube breach to occur in the same place every time.
	</p>
	<p>
		After writing all that, I started to get to work putting the new inner tube back into the tire to put onto a new wheel, but I found the tire itself is broken on the side.
		It&apos;s theoretically possible that the inner tube popping broke the tire, but I think the more likely possibility is that the broken tire caused the inner tube to rupture.
		I want to swap out the wheel anyway, just to be safe.
		My curiosity is getting the better of me though.
		Instead, the plan is to use the same wheel as I&apos;ve been using with the new inner tube and new tire.
		I have to know if the wheel is actually causing these problems.
		I mean, I found the bit of rusted metal that seemed to have broken off the staple I pulled out of the tire by finding where the air was escaping the inner tube.
		That means that the bit of rusted metal was lined up with the spot where the tube broke that time.
		Likewise, I later tracked another inner tube hole to being lined up with that same tire hole, even though I can&apos;t find anything sharp in the hole any more.
		At least two of the popped inner tubes had holes directly at that spot on the tire.
		It&apos;d be a really odd coincidence if the problem was never the tire, but the same tire spot was repeatedly lined up with the problematic spot on the wheel.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve set aside the tires I&apos;ve changed out recently, and started going through the others.
		Each tire, I found was already so thin that the strings are exposed and the tire shouldn&apos;t be used or a bad rupture in the tire itself was present.
		The exception is a single tire that&apos;s so thin - not thin rubber as in worn down, but just a thin tire like it belongs on a thinner wheel - that I don&apos;t think I should use it on this bicycle.
		All of these times that I&apos;ve removed bad tires, I&apos;ve been too tired to throw them out, and I forget about them.
		My pile of tires is garbage at this point.
		I took them all down to the dumpster tonight now, but it seems I&apos;m out of tires and can&apos;t get the bike working in time for work tomorrow.
		I&apos;ll be walking.
		I&apos;m not sure when I&apos;ll have time to get to the bike store for a new tire.
		I bet that&apos;s going to be expensive though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, I&apos;m back down to exactly one spare inner tube again.
		I <strong>*just*</strong> got all my broken tubes patched up the other day, too!
		This is absolutely ridiculous.

	<p>
		The past couple days, I&apos;ve been wanting to spend most of my gameplay time digging, hoping to stumble across a dungeon with cotton seeds.
		However, I also realise that I need to clear as much space for the underground resources in my storage room as I can.
		That&apos;s why I&apos;ve been focussing on completing the bridge.
		Otherwise, I would have just put up the cores of the bridge supports, then ignored the rest of the bridge for the time being.
