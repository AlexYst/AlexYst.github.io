	<h2>Productivity</h2>
	<p>
		A number of factors led to me being highly unproductive today, to the point where I didn&apos;t even make food and eat for most of the day and ended up giving myself a major headache from it.
		Most notably, of course, is the lethargy induced by my school.
		When school&apos;s not in session, that lethargy isn&apos;t so crippling on its own, but it&apos;s still very much there.
		Secondly, the lack of food I had prepared.
		I&apos;d planned to make a batch of salad first thing today.
		Third, the stupid fruit fly that made its way into my kitchen.
		Every time I went to make the salad, it made itself known just long enough for me not to want to expose my ingredients to it.
		That salad is my main food for the week, and I really don&apos;t want it contaminated by a nasty insect.
		When I tried to get rid of it, it&apos;d go back into hiding.
		I&apos;d leave, intending to come back later and hope it&apos;d come back out.
		I checked back periodically, not finding it, and would eventually give up and hope it&apos;d just left.
		I&apos;d start getting ready to prepare the salad again, and it&apos;d show back up.
		Ugh.
		I finally managed to get the thing, but I already had the headache by then, and in the mean time, wasn&apos;t feeling up to doing much when I hadn&apos;t even eaten yet today.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I&apos;d made the salad and eaten, I was a bit more productive.
		I got my inner tubes patched, moved my mattress to the now-partly-cleared living room to make it easier to clean the bedroom, and got my file manager links set up for dealing with the coming term.
		It doesn&apos;t sound like much, and I was feeling a bit disheartened.
		I went to check what else I needed to get done though, and realised what I&apos;d done already today was most of the other half of the to-do list I started work on clearing yesterday.
		All that&apos;s left on my list is to write a letter.
		And by write, I do mean write, not compose.
		I composed the letter months ago, but need to write it by hand and mail it.
		I&apos;ll get that done tomorrow, and everything I need done at the moment will be complete.
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, actually, I do need to add a new item to my to-do list: buy more bike tube patches.
		I&apos;m pretty much out now.
		Also, I need to finish moving Summer&apos;s stuff out of my living room, but not doing that on my own gives me an excuse to see my father a couple more times.

	<p>
		I built the cores of the bridge supports to the north, but when I went to make the ones to the east, I couldn&apos;t be bothered due to the lack of a decent reference point with which to position them from.
		I ended up instead building the tunnel at Original Isle first.
		I&apos;ll use the bridge supports in the tunnel as a reference point for the eastern bridge supports later.
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up going with a different tunnel style than originally planned.
		It looks more like the tunnel was just born through the stone and was never lines with walls, which is partly true.
		The corners are rounded with stone stairs though, giving it a cleaner appearance without making it look any less natural.
		I left silver sand and dirt in the walls where I could, and added flint to replace any gravel and coal I removed.
		I&apos;m not sure if or where I&apos;ll add the torches, but I think this style looks kind of rudimentary and unrefined, like major technology wasn&apos;t available during its construction.
	</p>
	<p>
		After getting the tunnel built, I added the cores for the bridge supports, but I found the ones to the south didn&apos;t quite line up right.
		I checked the positions of the supports in the tunnel repeatedly but couldn&apos;t find any issue.
		Fearing I&apos;d misplaced the supports outside the tunnel, I turned to my map.
		The north and south supports each show up five metres from the edge of the map, so that wasn&apos;t the problem.
		On closer inspection though, I&apos;d somehow managed to mess up one of the gaps between two supports.
		From the map history, it seems it was the final support I worked with two days ago.
		With that support off, all supports after it were also built in the wrong spots leading all the way up to Original Island, so I had to go back and fix all those, which was a bit annoying.
