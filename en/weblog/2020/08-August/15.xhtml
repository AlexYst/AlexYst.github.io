	<h2>Tired</h2>
	<p>
		Even after my nap last night, I went to bed at a reasonable time and got to sleep fairly easily.
		I slept about eight hours, waking up a couple times and going back to sleep, unable to bring myself to get up yet.
		When I did finally get up, I was still exhausted.
	</p>
	<p>
		I knew I had a shift at work today, but because my schedule keeps getting changed on me week-to-week lately, I wasn&apos;t sure if I worked at 15:00 or 16:00.
		I checked my planner to get the time, noticed my <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> appointment yesterday, saw I had a shift at work scheduled for the day after the appointment, and panicked.
		I thought I&apos;d failed to show up at work today because I&apos;d forgotten I had a shift.
		My brain must still be fried.
		I already <strong>*knew*</strong> I had a shift.
		I was checking the planner to find out <strong>*when*</strong>.
		I would say I don&apos;t know what&apos;s wrong with me, but I do.
		It&apos;s stress from the school&apos;s censorship of me.

	<p>
		I&apos;m mostly below the cloud layer at this point.
		It still jumps around, but at least most of its elevations are above me, keeping it from blinding me any more.
		So that&apos;s nice.
