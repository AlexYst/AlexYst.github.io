	<h2>Blasting music</h2>
	<p>
		The night assistant manager has been blasting their music lately.
		It&apos;s been so loud I can&apos;t hear my workmates and I can&apos;t hear the customers.
		Granted, I&apos;m a bit hard of hearing anyway.
		But without the music so high, I get by just fine, and the volume has been just ridiculous.
		It&apos;s been loud enough that I can&apos;t even think clearly.
		I told them I couldn&apos;t hear the customers with it up so high, and they turned it down to a reasonable level, but it was back up the next day.
		I&apos;m not up to begging them to turn it down every day, so I&apos;ve been managing by taking orders from the back room, memorising the orders and calculating the totals for the customers in my head, then running up front to the register to actually input the orders.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today though, I noticed that over by the boss, the volume was just fine.
		It&apos;s only over by the drive-though window and over by exit side of the oven that the music is so obnoxiously loud.
		The problem then, hasn&apos;t been the volume of the speaker.
		The problem has been that the boss puts their speaker on the opposite side of the room as themself, then blasts the music over the other sounds in the room in order to hear it at a decent volume on their side of the room.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the music so loud, I can&apos;t properly communicate with my workmates.
		As the drive-through person, I have to tell the pizza landers what I took, so they can make judgements and relay what needs to be cooked to the night assistant manager on the pizza dress station.
		They don&apos;t always hear me, I don&apos;t have when we&apos;re busy to make sure they did, and when they do yell instructions over to the assistant manager, the assistant manager doesn&apos;t always respond.
		I don&apos;t think the assistant manager hears them with the music so high.
		Then the assistant manager has been getting pissed off that we&apos;ve been running out of pizzas because they&apos;re not in the loop as to what needs to be cooked.
		I finally gave up and just started throwing in replacements for what I was taking, bypassing both the assistant manager and the landers.
		The assistant manager got agitated and told off the landers, thinking that the problem was that they weren&apos;t listening.
		So I stood up for the landers, and explained that I was having to throw things in myself because I was tired of having to yell over the loud music.
		The assistant manager tried to claim that the landers should be watching me to see what I take and I shouldn&apos;t <strong>*have*</strong> to tell them.
		That&apos;s garbage on at least two levels.
		First, the landers are often having to put most of their attention into making sure they get the pizzas out of the oven before they back up and burn.
		Second, the assistant manager, when they work as a lander, gets pissed off if people aren&apos;t telling them what they&apos;re taking.
		So to claim other landers don&apos;t need to be told is hypocritical.
		I went into neither of those points though.
		Instead, I pointed out how I was even having to leave the room to take orders because I couldn&apos;t hear customers.
		Whether the assistant manager wants to claim the landers need to be able to hear me or not, I need to be able to hear the customers.
		The music is definitely too loud if I can&apos;t.
		I was on break when the assistant manager was telling off the landers, so I jumped up off break to go take care of that situation.
		Having gotten my point accross as much as I was going to, I went back to finish my break, and when I got back, they&apos;d moved their enormous speaker over to their own station and turned it down.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the new managers tried to tell me I shouldn&apos;t work drive-through if I can&apos;t hear, and I should be able to hear even if someone&apos;s blasting music.
		They brought up that I&apos;m hard of hearing and tried to use that as justification that it was on me, not on the music being too loud.
		Amusingly, they tried to claim that <strong>*several*</strong> people blast their music.
		It&apos;s just a part of work here.
		I don&apos;t have this problem with anyone else though.
		It&apos;s only been the assistant manager and it&apos;s only been lately.
		I wouldn&apos;t describe the volume other employees play their music as anywhere close to &quot;blasting&quot;.
		But also, they keep their speakers near their stations, so their music is loudest where they&apos;re standing and listening to it.
		The assistant manager has been having to turn their music way up to hear it because they&apos;re putting the speaker over by the drive-through instead of over by their own station.
		I function perfectly fine, even with my bad hearing, when other employees have something to play.
		More importantly though, I pointed out that I need to be able to hear if they put me on landing or pizza dress, too.
		At three of the four major stations - the drive-through, the pizza dress station, and landing - music that loud interferes with getting work done.
		They can take me off drive-through if they want.
		I won&apos;t fight it.
		I don&apos;t even like working drive-through.
		But taking me off drive-through isn&apos;t a solution to the real problem, and an actual solution is necessary whether I&apos;m on drive-through or not.
		My head was still clearing up from having been dealing with the high volume all day, so I didn&apos;t think to bring it up until the conversation had long ended, I can&apos;t think when the music&apos;s that loud either.
		I was frequently forgetting things people had ordered because all the noise was getting to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because I confronted the assistant manager or not, but they&apos;ve now put me on the pizza dress station for tomorrow.
		As mentioned in past entries, the pizza dress station acts as central command for the store.
		I quit working that station when the assistant manager&apos;s there because they decided to throw a tantrum and have a power trip with me.
		If they want the power, they can take both the power and the responsibilities that come with it.
		Last time, I was unprepared for their power trip.
		This time, I&apos;m not.
		If they want me to to start taking the reigns of the store again, so be it, but I&apos;m not backing down again.
		If they want me to sit in the throne and deal with the stress that goes with it, they don&apos;t get to claim to be the boss.
		Now that I&apos;ve had that talk with them - a couple times at at least even, once on the day they had their little power trip - I think we&apos;re on the same page as to what the rules are and who is in charge.
		If they put me in charge and still have the gall to claim I&apos;m not in charge, I&apos;ll throw that garbage right back in their face.
		Cordially and politely, of course, but also very sternly.
		If you catch me off-guard, you can make me put up with just about anything new out of sheer shock, but I&apos;m not dealing with this a second time.
		I don&apos;t like to be the boss, but if I&apos;m going to be the boss, I&apos;m going to be the boss.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve given up on getting this iceberg cleared by the next website update.
		It was always a futile effort, but I thought I&apos;d at least try.
		Anyway, I still want to get something somewhat noticeable on the map finished in time for the update, so for now, I&apos;m focusing on excavating that dungeon near my temporary base camp.
		Once excavated, I think I want to clear some space around it, then build it into some sort of dwelling space as a more-permanent base camp for the area.
