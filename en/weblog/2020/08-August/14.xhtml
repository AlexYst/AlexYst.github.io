	<h2>Sleepless</h2>
	<p>
		Failure to fight through the lethargy previously caused me to have to stay really late the night before last in order to finish up my coursework.
		That threw off my sleep schedule, so when I tried to sleep last night, I couldn&apos;t.
		I just laid in bed for several hours trying to sleep.
		Eventually, I gave up, with only a few hours left until my <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> appointment.
		I figured I&apos;d be fine, as I still wasn&apos;t tired, and I&apos;d take a nap when I got home.
		As the time of the appointment drew nearer though, I was struck with a quickly-growing exhaustion.
		Finally, I&apos;d be able to sleep, but now I didn&apos;t have time.
		What a pain.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did get that nap after the appointment, though I put it off as long as I could, to try to get my sleep closer to the right time.
	</p>

		I tried to pay for both this appointment and my missed appointment.
		The new doctor that assisted last time handled my treatment.
		I think they might be one of the students the main doctor is training?
		When I went to pay for both sessions, the main doctor was tied up on the telephone and the new doctor wouldn&apos;t hear of it.
		And when the main doctor got off the telephone, the new doctor mentioned that I&apos;d tried to pay for both sessions, and they agreed that not charging me for both sessions was the way they preferred to operate.They said we&apos;re all family here, and they don&apos;t do that.
		At least I tried though.
	</p>
	<p>
		The doctor seems to think I have more mental fortitude than I do.
		At first, they disagreed that missing one appointment was a sign of my growing mental decline, and I had to explain that I don&apos;t do this.
		I told them this is the first time I&apos;ve ever missed an appointment like this.
		In truth, I did miss that one dental appointment, but the circumstances were different.
		The receptionist changed the date on me at the last minute, and it turned out the original date had already become set in my mind.
		I realised my mistake, but it was too late.
		This time was very different.
		I didn&apos;t have the wrong date, and the day before the appointment, I was looking forward to it.
		But then stress overwhelmed me and I forgot the appointment until the day after it was supposed to have occurred.
		Anyway, I think I convinced them when I explained my situation; I explained how I frequently end up just staring at the monitor for hours just trying to get myself to get to work.
		In truth, I actually play Minetest much of the time during one of these lethargy sessions, but if I don&apos;t, I <strong>*will*</strong> literally stare at the monitor and get nothing done anyway.
		They tried telling me I should just tell myself I can do it and that I&apos;ll be able to get to work.
		I explained that I try that every week, and every week, I fail.
		It doesn&apos;t work.
		The school has drained everything out of me.
		They said I should let the school have that power over me, and I agreed, but also said that I don&apos;t really have a choice.
		To take back the power would be to put everything back on the website that they made me take down, getting myself expelled or retroactively failed from my courses in the process.
		They wondered if the school has the power to censor like they are, and I said I wasn&apos;t sure, but I&apos;m certain they have the power to follow through on their threats if I don&apos;t comply.
		They said we sometimes have to do things we don&apos;t like when we&apos;re backed into a corner and I shouldn&apos;t throw away my schooling over it, and I explained that that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;m doing.
		I&apos;m complying.
		It&apos;s painful and takes a severe toll on my mental and emotional health, but I <em>am</em> complying.
		They again thought I should be able to talk myself into getting the work done earlier; that I shouldn&apos;t let the school have that power over me.
		I try that every week to no avail.
		I think my final explanation got through though.
		My journal is how I express myself; it is the story of my life, quite literally.
		If they have power over the journal, they have power over me.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

		I found myself fighting through the cloud cover, unable to see through the fog at the high elevation at which I was working today.
		The clouds weren&apos;t at this level before, but the cloud level changed on me.
		Once I got through most of the layer I&apos;d had to change strategy for due to being mostly blind when using the otherwise most-efficient method I&apos;ve found for ice-clearing, the cloud level changed on me again.
		I found myself repeatedly having to fight through or adjust for cloud-induced blindness at multiple levels of elevation.
		I have no doubt that this was the work of the <code>weather</code> mod, which for now, only affects cloud-management.
		I tried to disable clouds in my client, but found that setting unavailable from the escapee menu.
		I&apos;d have to exit to the main menu, which isn&apos;t accessible to me due to the way in which I start the game.
		I start the game from the command line instead of from the main menu so I can run the game as part of a script that backs up the game world after each session.
		I could edit the file by hand, but I can&apos;t do that mid-session, so the wrong version of the configuration file would have gotten backed up.
		Now that I&apos;ve written this though, I realise that the simple solution would be to temporarily remove the <code>weather</code> mod.
		It seems a bit like cheating, though, so I don&apos;t feel like doing it.
		That said, most players are able to just disable clouds client-side entirely.
		Simply making the clouds remain stable is less useful and less powerful than that, so realistically, it&apos;s not like I&apos;d be gaining an advantage I shouldn&apos;t have.
		I wouldn&apos;t even be gaining as much of an advantage as I should have.
		Still, it doesn&apos;t feel right.
