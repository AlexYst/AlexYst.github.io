	<h2>Malware</h2>
	<p>
		I received an advertisement in the mail yesterday from the local cable company.
		Having no interest in what they had to say, I haven&apos;t opened it, but part of the text is visible through from the outside through a window in the envelope.
		It mentions streaming of some kind, and I assume it&apos;s referring to steaming television shows.
		Knowing the company, it&apos;s almost guaranteed that the streams require <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> to be installed.
		Ignoring the fact that I&apos;m not interested in supporting proprietary media, I thought to myself that there was no way I&apos;d install that sort of malware on my system.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a bit though, I realised that <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> software <strong>*is*</strong> in fact malware though.
		I was just sort of using dramatic language in my thoughts, but malware is software programmed to deliberately cause the computer to act against the user.
		<abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> does only and exactly that.
		It&apos;s a form of malware.
		Software that includes <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> may have other functions, such as enabling the viewing of a video stream, but any malware can have some legitimate functionality among its features to entice <del>fools</del> <ins>the unwary</ins> into installing it.

	<h2>Tumbleweeds</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve always thought the idea of tumbleweeds was odd.
		You hear about them existing in deserts; strange, ball-shaped bushes, dead and blowing in the wind.
		Why would these things exist?
		Surely, these plants, being found only in these deserts, would be well-adapted to that environment.
		Why would they die off in such large quantities, break off, and and blow around in the wind?
		And why would they just happen to be ball-shaped, as if blowing in the wind was the entire point?
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbleweed">some interesting information about these oddities</a> today.
		First, they&apos;re not always found in deserts, and the tumbleweed isn&apos;t always the entire above-ground section of the plant.
		The flowers of a Queen Anne&apos;s lace and the structure that connects them curls up as it dies, breaks off, and forms a tiny tumbleweed.
		Second, these structures drop seeds as they blow around in the wind.
		No wonder they&apos;re round as if blowing in the wind is the entire point.
		Blowing around in the wind <strong>*is*</strong> the entire point!
		It&apos;s a seed dispersal mechanism.
		Suddenly, tumbleweeds make a lot more sense.
		I thought &quot;tumbleweed&quot; was a species, but it&apos;s not.
		It&apos;s a structure certain plants use as a part of their reproductive strategy.

		I decided today that I was going to plant an apple forest and a pine forest on the mainland.
		That was always the plan eventually, but I hadn&apos;t gotten to it just yet.
		But then I took a look at the map.
		There&apos;s still a decent chunk of that dirt reservoir I need to take care of first.
		I don&apos;t want to remove it just yet though, as I&apos;m going to need dirt to finish up the islands I&apos;m left with when I mine away this glacier.
		So finishing off the glacier-removal needs to happen first.
		I guess the plan is to just continue with that for the time being then.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten really fed up of having to leave my computer running while I&apos;m away any time I need coniferous litter to spread across dirt.
		The machine doesn&apos;t like running Minetest for hours on end, and tends to overheat, not to mention the fact that I&apos;m simply impatient.
		I finally decided just to add instantaneous dirt topper spreading as a feature of mushroom shovels.
		If a player attempts to place their mushroom shovel on a dirt node as if the shovel itself was a node too, the dirt-topper-spreading <abbr title="Active Block Modifier">ABM</abbr> will be set off for that dirt node.
		Of course, the usual limitations of that <abbr title="Active Block Modifier">ABM</abbr> still apply, you just don&apos;t have to wait for it to go off on its own.
		This means the dirt node won&apos;t react if not near something that would cause spread and/or the lighting level is too low at the moment.
		This is going to
