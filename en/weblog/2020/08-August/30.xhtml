	<h2>Storage unit</h2>
	<p>
		Last night, in my anger, I was rash.
		This is a big part of why I tend to deliberate over choices before making a final decision.
		Moving Summer&apos;s stuff back to her place now before I&apos;m ready for a confrontation isn&apos;t a good idea.
		At all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, what I need to do is get a storage unit and move her stuff there until my voice is fixed.
		This will buy me time while still allowing me to finally actually be able to move in my own home.
		I also won&apos;t have to move her stuff out all in one day.
		I can move it a few boxes at a time.
		It is literally buying time though.
		I&apos;m going to have to pay for this time in cash.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way home, I checked out a storage complex near her place.
		It&apos;d be a bit of a walk for me, and rather inconvenient, but it&apos;d mean quick access for her when she finally decides to take her stuff back or I finally get my voice fixed enough to confront her and make her take it back or forfeit it to a donation centre.
		Their smallest units are 1.5 metres by 3 metres by an unspecified height.
		I think I could fit most if not all of the stuff she left me into there, depending on how well I stacked and how tall the unit is.
		And it&apos;s only $64 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per month.
		I was expecting a cost of a couple hundred dollars per month when I started considering this.
		I haven&apos;t exactly rented a storage unit before, and Summer always made it out like they&apos;re expensive.
		The problem with this complex though is that they&apos;ve got a notice saying that due to the pandemic, they&apos;re only taking appointments via telephone.
		That&apos;s not going to work.
		<del>I might try knocking on the office door on Monday, explain my situation, and see if I can get an exception.</del>
		The notice does say the office will be in operation, but locked, so someone might answer the door and talk to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried searching for other storage units in town when I got home.
		It might not be worth the effort to even bother <strong>*trying*</strong> to give my business to a company that would post such a notice, assuming everyone has telephone service and that they&apos;re okay doing business like this over the telephone.
		Or if it <strong>*is*</strong> worth trying, it still might not work out, and I might have to get a unit elsewhere anyway.
		The complex near Summer&apos;s place didn&apos;t show up in search results.
		And at first, all the places that <strong>*did*</strong> were by far more expensive.
		I started wondering if that one storage complex was the odd one out, and most units actually do cost an arm and a leg.
		After further searching though, I found several places with rates only sightly higher than the rates of the place near Summer&apos;s home.
		Some even offered signing the lease and paying rent online, meaning that no telephone call whatsoever would be necessary.
		Just to not give money to an establishment that would try to get all potential customers to telephone in is probably worth the extra cost to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think this is a better plan of action.
		I can take Summer&apos;s boxes from my place, maybe making a commitment to take one per day, and I&apos;ll eventually get my living room back.
		I can even take multiple boxes on some days, when I have more time, or maybe take seven in one day and not bother for the rest of the week on busy weeks.
		Besides, knowing Summer, her place is probably still too cluttered to walk through.
		While my old bedroom might still be pretty much empty and able to hold all the stuff she filled my living room with, I probably wouldn&apos;t even be able to safely reach it without making a bigger mess, even if I wasn&apos;t carrying box after box after box.
	</p>
	<p>
		Actually, scratch the part above about maybe trying to talk to that cheaper storage complex tomorrow.
		I&apos;ve got an appointment with a different place.
		Their price for the same size of unit is $79 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per month, and while their prices aren&apos;t listed on their website, which is inconvenient, they do respond promptly via email even on weekends when the office isn&apos;t open.

<section id="patching">
	<h2>Patching inner tubes</h2>
	<p>
		My back wheel is significantly more bothersome to get on and off than my front wheel.
		Because of that, and because the back inner tube is only losing air quickly enough to need to be topped off every week or two, I couldn&apos;t be bothered to wrestle the wheel off and patch the tube.
		The back tube is currently managed.
		It&apos;ll be fine, and when the tube gets worse, I&apos;ll have replacements at the ready.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the front tube and all the spare tubes, I&apos;ve gotten them patched now.
		I&apos;m nearly out of patches though.
		I won&apos;t have enough for another patching session.
		I&apos;ll need to pick up more when I get a chance.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="surveillance">
	<h2>Surveillance</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the new cameras at work do more than watch.
		They also listen.
		How creepy!
		The air conditioning at work doesn&apos;t function, so employees are constantly complaining about how hot it is with three flame-powered ovens in the building.
		The franchise owner is really wiggy about people keeping the back door open though.
		Personally, I&apos;m in agreement.
		I feel safer with the door closed.
		Most days, I bring my laptop to work with me to work on things during my breaks.
		With the back door open, my laptop could get stolen, and my whole life is on this thing!
		I&apos;ve been trying to get people to listen to the franchise owner about keeping the door closed too, but they don&apos;t listen, and as the head manager and assistant manager - who both outrank me - are among those that prefer to disregard the instruction from the franchise owner that we keep the door closed, what I say on the matter doesn&apos;t tend to be taken seriously.
		Apparently, morning crew started discussing opening the back door.
		Immediately, they got a telephone call from the franchise owner who just said &quot;Don&apos;t open it.&quot;.
		Wow.
		So yeah, anything we say can be heard by the franchise owner at any time we&apos;re in the building.
		Very, very creepy.

	<p>
		I&apos;m going to have to set Palette Game aside again.
		I simply don&apos;t have the energy to deal with it in addition to everything else that&apos;s going on.
		I&apos;ve got work, I&apos;ve got school coming back into session on Wednesday, and now I have stuff to move into storage.
		All of that is on top of the lethargy the school induces in me.
		I scouted out the storage complex today, too.
		They&apos;re not where I thought they were based on their photograph online.
		Their photo is definitely accurate, but I thought I recognised them as being a storage unit I&apos;ve seen elsewhere in town.
		This place is a bit far to be carrying large boxes to on foot, so will take time an energy.
		I&apos;m going to start watching for a wagon at the second-hand store next to my workplace, or some other item to ease transportation.
	</p>
	<p>
		But yeah, it&apos;s back to the ice-mining in Minetest Game for me, as far as Minetest goes.
