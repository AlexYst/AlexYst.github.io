	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I had an interesting dream last night.
		The light switches weren&apos;t behaving as would be expected, which is a common occurrence in dreams.
		If you&apos;re aware of what the issue looks like, you can quickly become aware you&apos;re dreaming.
		I don&apos;t recall exactly which lighting anomaly I discovered, but it had something to do with a room in which the lights weren&apos;t on.
		Maybe they refused to turn on in an odd way or something?
		I don&apos;t recall.
		In any case, I was leaving the room into the hall to follow another entity, and I decided to try an experiment.
		I flipped the light switch in the next room we entered.
		The lights were on, and I fully expected them to refuse to turn off.
		They turned off, but rather slowly and in a way that left glowing orbs near the light fixtures for a few seconds.
		Though not the reaction I was expecting, it still didn&apos;t make sense, again showing that we were in a dream world.
		I pointed out this new anomaly to the entity I was following, and explained what it meant: none of this was real, and it was just a dream.
		I didn&apos;t mention that it meant the entity themself wasn&apos;t real either, but that was on my mind.
		Surprisingly, it wasn&apos;t hard to convince them this was a dream.
		From there, I convinced them to abandon reason and get up to some goofy mischief with me, as none of it actually mattered anyway.
		We could have fun with no consequences.
		That was an interesting experience.
		I&apos;ve actually been meaning to try something like that for years, but when I&apos;m asleep, I never remember.
		Once I find out I&apos;m dreaming, I forget to try to interact with other entities.

	<p>
		The floating islands neat the ground all seem to show up near the insanely-shaped mountains.
		It&apos;s like someone made odd shapes with a paintbrush, and they splattered the paint a bit above the shapes they drew.
		If I&apos;m being honest, I much prefer the more mellow shapes produced by the <code>v6</code> map generator, especially when it comes to the bases of the islands.
		<code>v7</code> islands are a pain to work with, and <code>v5</code> islands look like they&apos;d be even worse, not to mention that the shapes of the mountains above the water in <code>v5</code> maps don&apos;t make much sense.
		The only problem with <code>v6</code> is that it uses hard-coded biomes, so none of the new biomes introduced in the recent past are present.
		That means a lack of availability of several resources.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had been trying to work from the top of the iceberg to the bottom, which is pretty much the only feasible way to work when dealing with the steep slopes I was experiencing near the top.
		Things have gotten less steep nearer to the bottom, so I&apos;ve switched gears for a bit.
		Now I&apos;m working on clearing all the dirt, snow, and trees.
		That&apos;ll leave me only the ice to deal with, so I can leave more of my tools behind.
		With less tools taking up inventory space, I&apos;ll be able to carry more ice out with every load, and it&apos;ll be a bit more efficient.
