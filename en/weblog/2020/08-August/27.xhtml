	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was an all-female group of newly-acquired <a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/security-clearance-levels#toc11">D-class personnel</a>.
		Mostly, I saw the world through the eyes of D-13, but I could feel what all of the group felt.
		We were standing in a long line in a forest, waiting to be enter a facility where we were to be processed.
		We were all injected with something, and warned that any of us that refused the injection would be terminated.
		I got the impression that the liquid was laced with tracking nanobots or something, so the foundation would always know where we were.
		As each of us was injected in the lower back above the hips, one by one, I felt it each injection.
		It didn&apos;t exactly hurt, but it was unpleasant and made mu muscles tense up, and that tension increased with each new D-class injected.
	</p>
	<p>
		I woke up, and that tense feeling in my lower back stayed with me.

	<h2>Lethargy</h2>
	<p>
		Both today and yesterday, I planned to get some cleaning done.
		I was too lethargic and unmotivated to actually do it though.
		I had a bit of a headache for most of today, too.
		I&apos;m really not feeling well lately, and I don&apos;t jet the impression I&apos;ll be feeling up to much in the foreseeable future.
		I need to figure out how to fight through the lethargy.
		That&apos;s easier said than done though.
		How can I fight my way through this when my fighting spirit is so depleted?
		How can I work up the motivation to get past a lack of motivation?
		I need to figure something out though.
		Seriously.

	<p>
		I&apos;d been considering embedding the ice dungeon in a round, stone tower.
		I thought it&apos;d look cool to have a large but normal-looking tower with dungeon rooms as the interior.
		However, when I went to plan where the doors would be, I realised that all entrances to the dungeon are below sea level.
		The bridge from the surface of the ice sheet I&apos;d been planning is a no-go.
		A similar design is still feasible, but only depending on where the final water level of the area will be.
		And I can&apos;t know that until I&apos;ve cleared most of the iceberg away so I can know whether the liquid part of the sea south of the ice sheet is connected to the liquid part of the sea north of it.
		I&apos;ve been assuming that they&apos;re not connected.
		If this is indeed the case, I&apos;ll drain the norther part and leave it drained.
		As seen on the map, I already started lining the bottom of that part of the sea with dirt under the assumption that I&apos;d be allowed to keep it drained as no connection to the water on the other side of the ice sheet would cause that to look strange.
		As I&apos;ve been working here though, I&apos;ve noticed that the area isn&apos;t as sealed off as I&apos;d thought on initial inspection.
		I don&apos;t know what the area will be like when I&apos;m done, and I can&apos;t plan or build here until the glacier is fully taken care of.
		Use of this dungeon for anything will have to wait a bit.
		Ironically, I&apos;d been thinking of building it into a base of operations while working with the glacier, but I won&apos;t actually be able to safely construct the thing until my work is nearly complete anyway.
		Whatever I use the dungeon for, it can&apos;t be for this particular project.
		Still, the planed tower could be used for something else, if it turns out to be feasible to build.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think the most efficient way of taking down this iceberg is what I&apos;d been doing previously.
		That is, scaling the iceberg, finding a peak, taking coordinates, making my way back down, then tunnelling up to the peak from below so I have a direct route to wherever the top currently is.
		From there, I can take off layer after layer, returning to the bottom through my tunnel to drop off materials collected and to replace/repair my tools.
		This has been very effective thus far, but it gets rather boring, as it never looks like I&apos;m getting close to any discernible goal.
		It feels like I&apos;m not getting anywhere quickly, and to make the illusion more convincing, the iceberg gets increasingly wide as I get closer to the bottom.
		It takes a couple trips per layer I clear, and very little progress shows on my daily maps.
		To raise my morale, I&apos;ve switched to another approach for a bit.
		I&apos;ve started carving off sections of the iceberg in vertical chunks, rather than horizontal layers.
		I started with some thin areas created by exposing the dungeon, and have now moved on to mostly areas of ice overhanging from the rest of the ice.
		This produces results more visible on the map, but also, it&apos;s shrinking the size of the now-flat top I&apos;ve been working on.
		That means once I get back to doing this the right way, I&apos;ll start to see somewhat fast progress again, as the layers I&apos;m working with won&apos;t be so large.
