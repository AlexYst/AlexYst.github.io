		The assistant manager didn&apos;t show up for work today.
		Well then.
		That&apos;s fine by me.
		They can&apos;t try to pull one of their power trips on me if they&apos;re not even around.

		I think I finally found a good place to start on how to learn how MurmurHash works well enough to reverse it.
		I need to re-implement it.
		If I can program MurmurHash in <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> and get it to output the same results as Minetest&apos;s MurmurHash implementation, it&apos;ll show I have a decent understanding of how it works.
		I should be able to learn the hashing algorithm through the experimentation needed to program it, even if I&apos;m basically just translating from C++ to <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>.
		I didn&apos;t have time to get much done on that today, but it&apos;s a project that should prove educational.
		I&apos;ve already learned a bit about C++ so far, and have also hit a limitation in <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> that must be overcome in some way.
		I&apos;ll be learning a bit about both languages through this project.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the mean time, I&apos;ve got one of the laptops trying to brute force the problem while I&apos;m not at home using it.
		This time though, if interrupted, the brute force script is able to pick up near where it left off, repeating just a couple seconds of its previous efforts at most, instead of having to start from the very beginning.
		I&apos;m not sure how effective my reverse MurmurHash plan will be, so the brute force is sort of a stupid auxiliary plan that&apos;s never going to work but makes me feel like I&apos;m actually maybe making progress.
		Already, I&apos;ve found the only seed with a length less than six characters that creates a world like mine: <code>tj$ab</code>.
		It hashes to <code>9327718535682005256</code> instead of my world&apos;s <code>7906433434172987656</code>, but at least the least-significant half of the seed matches.
		It&apos;s ironic, but the least-significant half of the seed is the only half of the seed that&apos;s significant at all in generating the landscape, if you get what I&apos;m saying.
