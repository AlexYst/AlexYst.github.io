	<h2>Inner tube</h2>
	<p>
		I haven&apos;t worked up the energy to patch my inner tubes, even though literally all of my inner tubes have had holes in them for months.
		Of the two in my bike, the back tube wasn&apos;t holding air for long, but now can for some reason go a couple weeks without needing to be pumped up again.
		I&apos;m not sure what happened.
		The front one has been needing to be pumped back up daily, but I&apos;ve been doing it so I can keep going.
		Some work days, the tube still has had most of its air at end end of an eight-hour shift.
		Other work days, the tube has been flat after a four-hour shift.
		I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s been going on with that.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to go to work today, and found the tube wouldn&apos;t hold air at all though.
		Joy.
		I ended up late to work by a couple minutes.
		I&apos;m lucky this wasn&apos;t one of the days that I was so far behind that I only had ten minutes to get there.
		I would have been quite-noticeably late.
		Not that people didn&apos;t notice I was late, as I mentioned being a couple minutes late.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess tonight, when I get home, I need to have a patching session instead of going right to bed.
		I can&apos;t keep putting this off.
	</p>

<section id="Summer">
	<h2>Summer</h2>
	<p>
		At work, I found myself getting increasingly angry.
		Part of why I can&apos;t find the motivation to get my place cleaned or get my inner tubes patched is because I don&apos;t even have the space to do anything!
		I don&apos;t even have a place to sit, to get the tubes patched.
		I don&apos;t have a place I can make stacks and piles to organise things into before putting them where they belong, or most of all, to leave those stacks and piles for a while where they&apos;ll be out of the way, so I can slowly work on organisation.
		I&apos;m paced into my own home because Summer keeps so much of her stuff here, and she&apos;s been avoiding me for over two years!
		She wants nothing to do with me because I&apos;m not the man she wanted me to be - as I&apos;m not a man at all - but she things it&apos;s just fine to make my life miserable by using my living space to store her stuff.
		My home looks like hers, with more stuff than has business being here making it so I can&apos;t even get through the hall or the entryway without difficultly.
		This is exactly how she&apos;s lived for years, and exactly part of what I thought I&apos;d escape from when I moved out.
		I&apos;m done with this.
		I was going to try to wait until my vocal therapy was in the works, but I don&apos;t think I can wait much longer.
		I need space to live and breathe.
		I need to find a way to transport this stuff quickly, and get it all back to her place before the term starts.
		Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have any more days off before then.
		I&apos;m going to need to get this stuff moved overnight, most likely.
		I&apos;m not sure if she&apos;s around at her place either, so this is going to likely cause a confrontation I&apos;m not prepared for and can&apos;t be prepared for without my vocal therapy.

	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/issues/2710">Minetest Game is going into &quot;maintenance only&qout; mode, and won&apos;t be adding any new features.</a>
		Again.
		This has happened in the past, and I was honestly surprised when new features and nodes started showing up again.
		The Minetest developers really want Minetest Game to not be focused on though.
		They want to decouple it from the engine, and have people develop their own subgames to run on Minetest.
		This isn&apos;t anything new, but seeing this discussion ...
		I think I&apos;m going to try to do my part by reviving the Palette Game project.
		It&apos;s probably going to fall apart again.
		I&apos;m not good at building entire subgames.
	</p>
	<p>
		If - or I should say &quot;when&quot; - this doesn&apos;t work out, I&apos;ll of course continue focusing on Minetest Game.
		I get whey they want Minetest Game to lose focus.
		Honestly, it&apos;s garbage.
		There are so many competing values that went into it that it&apos;s an incoherent mess, not to mention that one of the mods - I&apos;m looking at you, <code>default</code> - ate a bunch of other mods, absorbing them into its own code instead of leaving them as separate mods when those mods were brought into the fold.
		That&apos;s turned it into a monolithic monstrosity that all other mods have to depend on in its entirety because they can&apos;t just depend on the parts that they actually use.
		So everyone has to have all parts of <code>default</code> installed.
		They can&apos;t just remove the stupid parts, or the parts they don&apos;t like.
		That said, while Minetest Game is a real piece of work, it&apos;s what holds us all together.
		We all develop our mods for Minetest Game.
		It&apos;s the only official subgame that&apos;s actually playable.
		Without other official subgames, Minetest Game will always be the champion.
		And the way the developers are trying to steer things, there aren&apos;t going to <strong>*be*</strong> any other official subgames.
		Their whole intent is that the position of &quot;official subgame&quot; not mean anything and that people develop subgames and use the subgames developed by others.
		That&apos;s honestly not going to happen though, for the most part.
		I will try.
		Again.
		But most people won&apos;t.
		And some of us that do try will fail.
