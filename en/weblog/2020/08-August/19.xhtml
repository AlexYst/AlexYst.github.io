	<h2>Tracking cards</h2>
	<p>
		I just learned today that the local grocery store&apos;s tracking cards are now going to be mandatory for people not wanting to pay higher prices for not using them.
		Lovely.
		They&apos;re going down the same path that one of the other grocery stores in the area has been down for a long time.
		It&apos;s a big part of why I don&apos;t shop at that store.
		Honestly, I mostly go to this local store because they take bottle return credits, which I haven&apos;t had for a while now because I don&apos;t have the time or energy to stand in the long lines at the bottle-return centre.
		The state decided it&apos;d be a great idea to set up a few bottle-return centres and stop mandating that the grocery stores take the bottles back.
		It was supposedly supposed to be easier for customers, as these redemption centres would be focused only on redemption, so they&apos;d be better maintained and whatnot.
		Instead, it&apos;s been a royal pain in the neck because the redemption centres are less numerous.
		That makes them, on average, further from you.
		Biking bags of bottles further out it often literally painful.
		The bags cut into my hands from the weight.
		And now with this pandemic going on, most of the redemption machines have had to be taken out of use because they&apos;re too close to one another to allow for social distancing.
		And that adds up to long lines outside the redemption centres at pretty much all times.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, what this means is that every time I shop at this grocery store, I&apos;m going to need to pick up another one of this store&apos;s tracking cards so I&apos;m not having to pay higher prices, which is ridiculous.
		With a new card for every purchase though, it nullifies the harm of the tracking cards as each new purchase is seen as coming from a new customer.
		What a waste of plastic though!
		I hate doing that, which is why I don&apos;t shop at that other grocery store, even though it&apos;s right across the street from my workplace.
		With this new tracking card policy, it&apos;s likely enough to break my habit of shopping at this grocery store at all.
		As mentioned, I shop there out of habit because they take bottle redemption credits.
		As I don&apos;t have those, and it&apos;s annoying to have to pick up a new tracking card every time I shop there, there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;ll just shop at the grocery store that&apos;s a bit further from home instead.
		They&apos;ve got lower prices and longer open hours.
		In fact, they&apos;re open 24 hours a day, so I don&apos;t have to worry about getting in before they close at all, aside from around certain holidays they close for.
		This new policy of charging customers more if they won&apos;t submit to the tracking card program is going to cost them most of the business they&apos;ve been getting from me.
		It&apos;s just too bad other people won&apos;t see it that way and most will likely submit.
		My choosing to switch grocery stores isn&apos;t going to get the to fix the issue.
		At least I won&apos;t allow myself to be a part of the problem though.
		There&apos;s value to me in that.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve been wanting to learn a bit of C++ so I can contribute to Minetest, though I&apos;ve got to start small before I can learn to do anything useful.
		Additionally, I&apos;ve still been unable to fully get the idea of finding seed hash collisions out of my mind.
		It wasn&apos;t really feasible the way I was doing it.
		I&apos;ve known all along that if I could write a Lua script for seed-hashing, it&apos;d go much quicker, but the seed-hashing function isn&apos;t available in the Lua <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>.
		And why would it be?
		That function is needed only for finding the numeric seed when a new world is instantiated.
		The numeric seed is then saved to one of the files in the world&apos;s directory and the unnecessary string seed is discarded.
		The string seed is never used for anything from that point on, and no new seeds are ever needed.
		There&apos;s absolutely no legitimate game play reason to make the seed-hashing function available to mods.
		This isn&apos;t directly related to game play though.
		Anyway, with all that in mind, I thought I&apos;d try to figure out how to add functions to the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got further than I thought I would, to be honest.
		I don&apos;t know C++, so it&apos;s a bit daunting jumping right into such a large code base, but I&apos;m not really sure what else I can do.
		I don&apos;t have the attention span or motivation for dealing with &quot;hello world&quot; scripts and the like.
		I <strong>*need*</strong> a real project or I won&apos;t learn.
		Anyway, I found the areas of the code I needed to edit, for the most part, sometimes using error messages to figure out something else needed to be edited and working out what I&apos;d failed to do from there.
		I ran into a final problem though.
		I think the what I&apos;ve done has the behaviour that it needs to, except that it also causes a segmentation fault and crashes the game.
		Yeah ...
		A pretty big problem.
		I couldn&apos;t figure out how to fix it though.
		I ended up <a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=25239">asking for help</a>.
		The Minetest community is usually really good about helping out people trying to learn new things when it comes to the Lua side of things, so it&apos;s my sincere hope that they&apos;re just as welcoming to people trying to work with the C++.
		My guess is that the only difference will be the smaller number of knowledgeable users.
		All the programmers know how to use the Lua <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>.
		Lua&apos;s simpler to learn, and is a pretty easy starting point.
		Much fewer of the community&apos;s programmers have even touched the C++ side of things though.
		C++ is where the real code is.
