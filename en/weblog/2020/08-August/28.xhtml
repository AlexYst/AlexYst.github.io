	<h2>Cameras</h2>
	<p>
		The franchise owner has now installed cameras in the store.
		We&apos;ve had cameras at both registers for as long as I&apos;ve worked there, but the franchise owner stopped using them a while back and they&apos;ve just been sitting on the ceiling doing nothing.
		I&apos;m not sure why they needed to be replaced, and not just reactivated.
		Maybe they weren&apos;t compatible with the franchise owner&apos;s new system.
		I mean, they used to use the old cameras while their office was in the store with us.
		Maybe the old ones can only run the feed on the premises, and they&apos;d need to invest in a machine and software that&apos;d record the feed locally, then transmit it to their new office.
		Maybe these cameras have a built-in way to transmit their feeds remotely.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I&apos;m all for getting security cameras, I don&apos;t think these ones are intended for security.
		One&apos;s in the lobby, watching over the front register.
		Perfect.
		We&apos;ve been robbed in the past while no cameras were present for evidence, and both the registers should have working cameras nearby.
		The back register has no camera though.
		What?
		Instead, there&apos;s a camera over by the pizza dress station and another in the back room.
		The franchise owner isn&apos;t watching customers in case there&apos;s a problem.
		The franchise owner is watching <strong>*us*</strong>!
		I&apos;m rather offended by that.
		I mean, it&apos;d kind of be one thing if both registers were being watched <strong>*and*</strong> we were being watched.
		It&apos;d still be a bit uncalled for, but I&apos;d see that the franchise owner is trying to keep an eye on their entire establishment.
		But no.
		They&apos;re specifically watching employees, probably so they can notice any little time in which employees could be doing more and aren&apos;t.
		We&apos;re not robots though.
		I&apos;m one of the hardest workers we&apos;ve got, so I&apos;m one of the least likely to have the cameras used against me, but I still feel offended by this.
		I don&apos;t think any of us need big brother keeping an eye on us throughout the entire work day.

	<h2>Tomatoes</h2>
	<p>
		Someone actually completely killed and removed the tomatoes behind my workplace now.
		That&apos;s rather sad.
		All the weeds were gone from the area, so I suspect the franchise owner did it while they were over.
		I don&apos;t think the head manager would care enough to put in that much effort.
		Then again though, they did try to kill the tomatoes once, so I wouldn&apos;t put this past them.

	<p>
		I made several holes up through the ice marking out the next ice overhang I need to carve off.
		That ice overhang takes up the majority of the flat space I&apos;ve carved off of the top of the iceberg though.
		There&apos;s this strange tunnel through the thing at sea level.
		As the entire point in carving off these overhangs is to break the job into smaller, more-manageable jobs, carving off this particular overhang seems counterproductive.
		The job would be almost as large, a little bit more difficult, and would leave behind a couple peaks that&apos;d be more of a pain to take out than the good done by creating them.
		So instead, I&apos;m now just carving off chunks off the iceberg from east to west.
		It&apos;s not the most well-planned strategy, but it&apos;s getting the job done.
