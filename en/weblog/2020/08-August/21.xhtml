	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that humans laid eggs.
		That was just how human reproduction worked.
		But there were these odd creatures that were hatching from some batches of eggs.
		These things were decidedly not human, and wanted to destroy us.
		They were shapeshifters, and would take on a variety of forms, but their mothers wouldn&apos;t listen to the fact that they were dangerous or even that they weren&apos;t human.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went through the process of trying to deal with a batch of these things three times.
		I was some sort of disembodied spirit by nature, and each time, I would possess the father of a couple that had just produced such eggs.
		It was my goal to attempt to convince the mother of the impending threat and get her to dispose of her children before they hatched.
		When I inevitably failed, I moved to the next father, and tried convincing the next mother.
		The first two mothers wouldn&apos;t even listen.
		At all.
		Even after their children hatched, the mothers wouldn&apos;t accept that they weren&apos;t human, even though they looked nothing like us.
		These children killed their mothers and the fathers I possessed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The third mother actually acted like a normal person herself.
		When I captured one of the hatched creatures to show her, she saw that the thing wasn&apos;t human.
		She didn&apos;t seem afraid of it on her own accord, but actually listened to my story, including the fact that this was the third iteration of this I&apos;d gone through, and I knew what I was talking about.
		Her sister had even been one of the other mothers to be brutally slaughtered by these things in a previous iteration.
		She understood what I explained, and we were going to destroy this creature and the remaining eggs together.
		I turned away for a bit though, and not only had the creature escaped confinement, but a second hatchling had joined it.
		They were both with their mother, who was now acting even less sane than the other two mothers.
		While the other two seemed to be unaware that their children were even anomalous or killing people but otherwise acted like normal mothers, this one seemed to have had her brain suddenly switched off and the monsters were now in control.
		At this point, I somehow became aware that I was dreaming.
		I wasn&apos;t sure how to stop the monsters, and I panicked.
		I grabbed both of them and before they could finish becoming goo to slip out of my hands, I woke myself up, intending to bring them out of the dream world and save the dream world from them, still under the spell of the dream enough to think the dream world real, but not enough to think I was stuck there.

<section id="cleaning">
	<h2>Apartment-cleaning</h2>
	<p>
		I got a fair bit of cleaning done today, considering my current limitations.
		I&apos;ve quickly become discouraged though.
		I need to move my stuff around to work, but I&apos;ve got nowhere feasible to move it to.
		With Summer&apos;s stuff filling my living room, my stuff has had to be crowded into all the other rooms.
		I&apos;ve had to shift a bunch of stuff into very awkward and inconvenient places, wasting a lot of time both today and in the future as I work around it all.
		The cleaning will continue, but it&apos;s a pain in the rear and I&apos;ve given up for today.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mainly, I just need to get my bedroom nice and usable again.
		I&apos;ve had to stash so much stuff in there just to keep it away from Summer.
		My bedroom was the only room I could lock, so everything of any importance to me had to be kept there, in addition to the normal bedroom stuff.
		Now that the lock on the front door has been changed though, the entire apartment is safe.
		Anything that doesn&apos;t need to be in the bedroom can be moved to other crowded parts of my home, and I&apos;ll have at least that one nice place to sit and get things done when I&apos;m at home.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I have usable space to inhabit again, even if only just the one room, I need to look into online vocal therapy.
		I&apos;d really wanted to get this done in person, not to mention that the websites I found seeming to offer vocal therapy are rather confusing in their presentation to the point that I&apos;m not sure if they operate online or have some office somewhere that yo go to.
		I need to find something though.
		I need to get my therapy started.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, once my voice is at least presentable, I need to wait for the next break between terms after that and get all of Summer&apos;s stuff moved back to her place.
		The vocal therapy has to come first though, as this is going to cause a confrontation.
		When she decides to finally talk to me due to her frustration and anger, I need to sound like myself rather than sound like what she sees me as.
		I need the confidence to stand my ground too, which will come much easier when I&apos;m not stuck sounding like the man I&apos;m not.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I guess that&apos;s my vague road map for the time being.
		If I can work up the motivation to work through the lethargy long enough to get my bedroom mostly cleaned, I should be able to slowly touch it up even if the next term has started.
		And if I get it done before school starts and manage to get into therapy,

	<p>
		I spent my Minetest time today continuing to grind away at the iceberg.
		It feels like the sort of project that&apos;ll never end, but I&apos;m actually making progress.
		To be honest, tackling this iceberg seemed like an incredibly daunting task since the initial creation of this world.
		At this point though, it&apos;s not really daunting any more.
		It&apos;s just tedious.
		I&apos;d sort of half hoped I&apos;d have the iceberg cleared before school started back up, but even before the term ended, I knew that that probably wouldn&apos;t happen.
		I hadn&apos;t even taken into account that the iceberg gets wider near the base when making my estimations though.
		It&apos;ll take longer than originally estimated, and certainly won&apos;t be done in time.
		Not that any particular deadline of any meaning is in place.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m thinking about putting patches of clay back into the seafloor.
		It&apos;d save me some much-needed silver sand, but it&apos;d also add a bit of needed variety.
		I might reintroduce dirt patches, as well.
		In particular, there was underwater dirt patches near the shoreline to the south before I&apos;d even gotten started.
		Putting them back would get me some silver sand to use elsewhere.
		Less silver sand used means less mining needed before I can complete the project.
