	<h2>Apartment cleaning</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve started cleaning my apartment again.
		I tried to finish the cleaning during my last break from school, but I just couldn&apos;t work up the energy to finish.
		I&apos;m hoping this time, I can get it done.
		I spent a bit more time testing Minetest code today than I intended to, then I ended up messing up and heading to work an hour early costing me more time, so I didn&apos;t get as much cleaning done as I&apos;d hoped to, but even at this pace, if I keep going, I should be done by the time school starts back up.

<section id="pants">
	<h2>Pants shopping</h2>
	<p>
		I ended up misreading my planner because I was tired last night, and thought that tomorrow&apos;s shift was today&apos;s shift.
		As a result, I thought I was supposed to be in the building and clocked in by 15:00, but I was actually supposed to be there by 16:00.
		Honestly, I&apos;m just glad it wasn&apos;t the reverse, and I showed up an hour early, rather than an hour late.
		It&apos;d be nice to have a consistent schedule though, so this sort of thing wouldn&apos;t even need to happen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I decided to use part of my wasted hour shopping for pants.
		A few pairs of my pants have been ripping, but I&apos;ve been putting off buying more because the changing rooms at the local second-hand store have been closed due to the pandemic.
		I fit into some size 14s, but not other size 14s, which is a pain without a dressing room to try them on and tell the difference.
		I figured I&apos;d break down and take the risk.
		I need new pants, and today, I had an hour with which I couldn&apos;t otherwise be particularly productive.
		On the way out though, I expressed my disappointment that the changing rooms are closed, and the checker told me I could bring back any that didn&apos;t fit if I left the tags on.
		Seriously?
		So I can try them all on, I just cant try them on before removing them from the building?
		That seems ... arbitrary and counterproductive.
		It means they didn&apos;t close the dressing rooms to avoid having people contaminate the clothing, so why did they close the dressing rooms?
		Are they particularly worried about the dressing rooms themselves becoming contaminated or something?
		In any case, if I need more clothing later, and I probably will after I hopefully go through my closet this break, I won&apos;t need to fear wasting money on clothing I end up not fitting into.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		As mentioned previously, I&apos;d like to get into Minetest streaming/video-production at some point after I get started on vocal therapy.
		As I&apos;ve also discussed, I&apos;ve considered setting up auxiliary worlds with a connected cannon to the main world that I currently inhabit.
		Since school got out, I&apos;ve been planning how I want to connect the worlds.
		The previous plan was to simply build some sort of trans-dimensional teleport machine.
		I&apos;ve been working on something a bit more interesting now though.
		Basically, the idea is that the dimension-hopping machine doesn&apos;t work as intended, and I get dumped into a void between worlds.
		There are basic structures made of sand I can walk on, so I can actually navigate the void to an extent, but there&apos;s nothing really to do there.
		From there though, I can get to other actual worlds.
		Originally, these structures were going to take the form of a perfect grid of rooms that could be navigated to reach other worlds with seeds determined based on the coordinates of the rooms.
		At this point though, I&apos;ve come up with a better layout.
		Basically, I unregister all the biomes, register a new one that&apos;s mostly like the sandstone desert biome but without any decorations associated with it, and put dimensional rifts in the rooms of the dungeons.
		The seeds, map generators, and map generator flags will be determined when the rift is generated by in the void world, and depending on the rift I enter, a different map will be reached.
		From there, I end up trapped in that world until I can mine the resources needed to build a dimension-hopping machine in that world and get back to the void, where I can enter a new world or go home.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the void, it&apos;s always night, so it&apos;s dark.
		There&apos;s no sun in the void, so no source of light.
		The sky is black, there are no clouds, no sun, no other stars, no moon.
		I&apos;ve gotten all that programmed already.
		The reason for all the sand is that sand seems to fall out of existence when you mine sandstone.
		Four sand are crafted into one sandstone, but mining one sandstone results on one sand being returned.
		So where do the other three sand go?
		Well, they end up falling out of the world and into the void, where it all collects from all the worlds in which this quirk exists.
		It collects in the void, where it has built up quite a bit by now.
		At this point, the main thing I need to do is draw the dimensional rift texture.
		The rest of the <code>void</code> mod will be easy after that.
		I&apos;m not quite sure how I want to handle the rift heading back into my main world though.
		That obviously can&apos;t be randomised like the other rifts will be, as I&apos;ll need to exit from that rift when I first enter the void.
	</p>
	<p>
		For effect, I&apos;ve also figured out how to compile the client such that it claims the map seed is &quot;null&quot;, rather than an integer.
		It&apos;s perfect for a world that isn&apos;t supposed to be a world at all, but a lack of a world.
		This differs from a zero seed, of course, as zero is a valid map seed.
		It used to be the case that negative map seeds were allowed too.
		Though never chosen randomly, the game would allow you to set the seed to a negative value.
		I think that got changed when string seeds were added, but I&apos;m not completely sure.
		I think the seeds were changed from signed to unsigned at that point, removing negative seeds from the game.
		One thing I tried to do was manually change the seed to negative, as then I wouldn&apos;t need to hack the client to get an obviously-anomalous seed displayed.
		My hope was that the seed was sent to the client as a string based on what&apos;s in the world file.
		This is the post-hashed value, so I assume normal string seeds can&apos;t be placed there, but I knew C++ would convert it into a positive value when it cast it from a string to an unsigned integer in a way that basically amounts to wrapping it from negative to hugely positive.
		The sign would just be the high-order bit of the unsigned integer.
		I&apos;d hoped this might create a discrepancy between what the server told the client and what the server actually used for map generation, but this wasn&apos;t the case.
		The seed was converted to a positive integer, the world&apos;s relevant file was updated to reflect the correct value, and the correct value was sent to the client.
		Hacking the client to display the seed as null admittedly does have a nicer effect, I&apos;d just hoped it wouldn&apos;t be necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m thinking about allowing the <code>dungeon_loot</code> mod to continue adding the chests to generated dungeons, too.
		Maybe the chests and their contents are from other players that used the <code>/pulverize</code> command to rid themselves of unwanted items.
		Or maybe they were brought to the void by some advanced civilisation that, unlike me, figured out how to transport inventory items into the void and weren&apos;t limited within the void to only what they could find in the void itself.
		In any case, almost none of the dungeon loot items will be of any value whatsoever to me.
		The sticks and the coal will be useful for crafting much-needed torches, which will serve as my only source of light if I go deeper into the ruins in search of rifts.
		As for the rest of it, there&apos;s not much I can do with it.
		The seeds won&apos;t grow without mese lamps or daylight, neither of which I&apos;ll have access to.
		I can get broken glass from some of the chests maybe, but without a furnace, I can&apos;t recycle those into usable glass to make mese lamps from.
		I also won&apos;t have the planks needed to make mese light posts, which would work in place of mese lamps and let me conserve some glass.
		I&apos;d still need glass even then though.
		I guess the lava buckets might be helpful as a light source, but they&apos;d be a dangerous one.
		Any picks found could provide a little bit of digging capability, but it would be a finite capability in need of using sparingly.
		Additionally, sticks found could be used with found iron ingots and mese crystals to form more picks, instead of torches.
		It&apos;d be something to consider.
		I&apos;d never dare use finite resources to make tools in my main world, but in the void, it doesn&apos;t really matter.
		It&apos;s kind of a junk world intended just to help tell a story, and not a world to be taken seriously.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was testing how the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> works, I ran into an odd quirk that I can&apos;t really explain just yet.
		I read the <code>dungeon_loot</code> mod&apos;s code to figure out how it knows where the dungeons are.
		I remembered reading somewhere that a new feature was added at some point just to make that mod work, and it determined where the floors of the dungeons were or something like that.
		When I read the code, I found it gets the Minetest <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> to tell it where all dungeons and temples are, and it uses that to find coordinates within each chamber.
		From there, it manually searches for the walls of the chambers and works with those.
		Dungeons and temples seem to be distinct features, according to the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>, and to find out what the difference was, I had my code treat the two differently.
		No temples were generated though.
		At all.
		In any of my test worlds beyond the point I&apos;d started doing anything with temples/dungeons.
		I&apos;m not sure if maybe temples are something the Minetest developers plan to implement later?
		IN any case, they don&apos;t seem to ever generate, for now.
		Honestly, I thought temples might be the larger rooms with larger hallways connecting them, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m debating about which options I should allow to be randomised for new worlds accessed through the void world.
		One thing I&apos;ve been thinking about is disallowing any set of options that would prohibit access to something <code>liblevelup</code> would count.
		This would eliminate the possibility of ending up with a <code>singlenode</code> world, which would in Minetest Game just be an endless expanse of air that you fall through until you reach the absolute depths.
		Such a world would be canonically inescapable, as there&apos;d be no way to mine the resources needed to build an escape device with which to get back to the void.
		However, this limitation would also eliminate <code>v6</code> worlds and <code>flat</code> <code>nolakes</code> worlds, which are otherwise legitimate and potentially of interest.
		I wouldn&apos;t want such worlds to be my main world, due to the restricted access to node drops, but as auxiliary words, they&apos;re not necessarily problematic, so it seems odd to exclude them.
		Maybe a better idea would be to exclude any combination of options that disallows access to <strong>*all*</strong> drops.
		That&apos;d eliminate <strong>*only*</strong> <code>singlenode</code> worlds, which are - as discussed - completely unplayable.
