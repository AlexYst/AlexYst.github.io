<section id="storage">
	<h2>Storage unit</h2>
	<p>
		I went in to take a look at the available storage unit and sign the lease.
		The landlord said I was only the third person in seven years to actually read lease agreement before signing.
		People really shouldn&apos;t sign things without knowing what they&apos;re signing.
		The fact that you&apos;re signing that you agree to something should spur you to find out just what it is that you&apos;re agreeing to.
		Anyway, while I was reading through, the first instance of pronoun usage in reference to the tenant said &quot;he/she/they&quot;, but none of the usages of pronouns in reference to the tenant were so inclusive, so I started crossing the relevant pronouns out and replacing them with &quot;they&quot;.
		The first time, the landlord mentioned I&apos;d even found and corrected a typo while I was reading the agreement, so I explained what had actually happened.
		They asked about what a &quot;they&quot; is, so we had the gender talk.
		They kept calling me a &quot;she&quot; though anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though it&apos;s still rude, it often feels less hurtful when people call me a &quot;she&quot; rather than a &quot;he&quot;.
		I&apos;m very obviously male still.
		I haven&apos;t been able to get my voice fixed, and my face isn&apos;t at all feminine, unfortunately.
		Partly, it&apos;s a welcome relief to be called anything <strong>*other*</strong> than a man, as almost everyone assumes I&apos;m a man and won&apos;t stop calling me one even when I ask them to.
		But also, the only manly thing about me when you only know me on a surface level is my body.
		When people refer to me as a &quot;he&quot;, it shows me that what they consider my core defining aspect is either my outward appearance or my male genitals.
		I tend to assume the latter, as most people don&apos;t understand that there&apos;s a difference between sex and gender, so they consider anyone with a penis to be a &quot;he&quot; by definition.
		It&apos;s less offensive when I&apos;m not being told my core defining aspect is my reproductive organs, which are such a vile thing to me that I literally got their primary purpose surgically disabled.
		Reproduction, while I admit it&apos;s my primary purpose and the the primary purpose of <strong>*all*</strong> life forms, is what I consider to be the most vile and despicable thing a human being is capable of.
		To be told my core defining aspect is part of me that has specifically evolved to fulfil that vile end is to call me myself vile and irredeemable.
		If we lack our core defining trait, we&apos;re not ourselves at that point.
		So to say that my core defining trait is reproduction is to say I cannot be a net positive, no matter how much I try and no matter what I do.
		It hurts.
		It hurts much more than people realise.
		I&apos;m literally crying as write this.
		I understand what my true purpose is.
		I&apos;m aware it&apos;s the only thing I exist to do.
		I don&apos;t need to be reminded.
		But I reject that purpose with every fibre of my being, and I fully and completely refuse to fulfil it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, rant aside, other things on the forms stood out as well.
		For example, the stuff stored at the stuff stored at the complex is not insured against nuclear disaster.
		Hilarious.
		If there&apos;s a nuclear disaster, I&apos;ve got bigger problems than the loss of Summer&apos;s stuff she left in my living room.
		Also, one of the forms asked for both a work telephone number and a mobile telephone number.
		That was a bit irritating to think about.
		First, why do they need a work number <strong>*at all*</strong>?
		Why do they need to be able to pester you at work?
		Second, they ask for specifically a mobile number, not, more broadly, a personal number.
		They want to be able to pester you anywhere you go (again, at this point, why do they even <strong>*need*</strong> a work number, as they can reach you wherever you are anyway without it).
		A home telephone number isn&apos;t good enough for them.
		But also, the fact that they&apos;re trying to insist everyone gives them identify by a purely numeric communication handle (a so-called telephone number) and accept telephone communications from them is one of the things that tends to bother me.
		They also wanted an emergency contact also with a work number and mobile number.
		I left the emergency contact field blank.
		I do my best to make it clear not everyone communicates by telephone.
		Regardless of the fact that I <strong>*could*</strong> get my father&apos;s telephone number if I asked for it, and he&apos;d be the one I&apos;d use as an emergency contact, there&apos;s no reason why I should be required to have an emergency contact with a telephone.
		And as someone that doesn&apos;t have telephone service, why would I know <strong>*anyone&apos;s*</strong> telephone number even if I know people that have telephones?
		The landlord prompted me to go back and fill these parts out, so I explained that I don&apos;t have telephone service and can&apos;t provide any numbers.
		The landlord then remembered that I&apos;d contacted them originally via email, and said to put down my email address instead.
		Perfect.
		There was no pushing after that or asking if there were any family members or something with numbers I could use.
		Many places will try to get you to give them someone else&apos;s telephone number if you lack one.
		This is irritating as well on a number of levels.
		First, maybe this other person doesn&apos;t want their number given out.
		Second, maybe I don&apos;t know people with numbers or don&apos;t know their numbers.
		Third, maybe I don&apos;t want other people contacted on my behalf.
		Anyway, they pointed out the emergency contact part too, so I said I don&apos;t know anyone&apos;s numbers - which is legitimately true - but if they&apos;d accept another email address, I could do that.
		They were fine with that.
		Another part of one of the forms made me agree not to store toxic stuff.
		I couldn&apos;t help but chuckle, silently asking myself if stuff owned by a toxic parent qualifies as toxic stuff.
		Of course, I know that&apos;s not what&apos;s meant, so it&apos;s not an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
		After getting the unit rented, I headed home to take my first load.
		Hauling two bins, the round trip cost me <strong>*TWO HOURS*</strong>, not to mention that it left red marks on my chest that&apos;ll take several days to heal.
		The weight wasn&apos;t something I&apos;m used to carrying that far, and I&apos;ve got far heavier boxes to carry still, not to mention a bit of furniture.
		The landlord offered to lend me their dolly tomorrow.
		I might not have time to take a trip tomorrow because of errand Tuesday, though.
		A dolly would be HUGE help, though not as much as a sufficiently-sized wagon, I think.
		The borrowed dolly also would restrict when I can come by.
		The gate is open from 07:00 to 19:00, but office where I&apos;d speak with landlord to pick up dolly opens at 09:00.
		With work restricting my time further, usually needing to be at work by 15:00 or 16:00, time is precious.
		I think I&apos;m going to try to invest in a collapsible wagon tomorrow.

<section id="theft">
	<h2>Looking like a thief</h2>
	<p>
		The franchise manager telephoned today asking about a missing cash drop that was in my name.
		$260 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> was just inexplicably missing.
		I wasn&apos;t sure what could have happened, and I wasn&apos;t sure what to say.
		I ended up saying I&apos;d cover the cost out of pocket, but seriously, what could have happened to the money?
		I certainly didn&apos;t steal it.
		Besides, I&apos;m not that stupid.
		If I were a thief, there are much better ways that I could possibly get away with taking cash than to steal part of or all of a cash drop.
		If I were to steal part of or all of a cash drop, there&apos;s a 100% chance the missing money would get noticed, just as this missing drop got noticed.
		Without an explanation though, this could easily happen again.
		Who took/lost the money?
		Sometimes, the head manager hands me a cash envelope that&apos;s already been dropped in their name in the computer and tells me to put it in the safe.
		They&apos;re trusting me not to take it.
		I don&apos;t do that though.
		When I drop cash in the system, I take the time to drop it physically into the safe as well, so there&apos;s zero chance that someone pocketed the money before it made it to the safe.
		Without an answer as to what had happened, I might end up paying for more missing money just to not look like a thief myself.
		I can&apos;t afford to keep doing that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thankfully, a memory hit me.
		One day, when we&apos;d been super slammed, the register locked up and demanded a cash drop, as it tends to often do in the least-opportune times.
		As I always do when I&apos;m working the drive-through window, I got weird about making customers wait, so I pulled the money, enveloped it, and took their order.
		Normally, I keep the drop in-hand until I drop it in the safe when I do that though.
		This time, I put it under the cash register, intending to put it in the safe as I passed it after I took the order.
		Again, as I always do, except the putting it under the register part.
		I must not have retrieved the envelope though, as when I checked based on this memory, the envelope of cash was still there, and had exactly the missing amount of money in it.
		I&apos;m lucky no one noticed it and stole it.

<section id="keys">
	<h2>No keys</h2>
	<p>
		The night assistant manager didn&apos;t show up today, and one of the shift-leaders-in-training had to extend their own shift to take the assistant manager&apos;s place.
		So they were going to close the store.
		The other shift-leader-in-training was also scheduled to close the store.
		I was scheduled to work nearly until closing time, but get out half an hour prior.
		We thought nothing of it, at first.
		I would have walked out of the building when they no longer needed me.
		Near the end though, it was revealed that the one who&apos;d had to extend their shift was under the impression that they were closing with me, not the other shift-leader-in-training.
		When the other shift-leader-in-training cleared up that misunderstanding, the one extending their shift pointed out that I was the only one in the building with keys.
		I had a good laugh over that.
		What a riot.
		If they hadn&apos;t caught that, I would have gone home, and they&apos;d be unable to lock the building.
		That would have sucked for all of us.
		They&apos;d probably have had to telephone someone.
		If they thought about it, the person to call would be the day assistant manager, who lives across the street from our workplace.
		I&apos;m not sure if they know that&apos;s where they live though, and might have telephoned the head manager or the franchise manger.
		Whoever they called would have been annoyed though, and  potentially angry.
		Caught before I left, the situation was hilarious.
		Caught after that, the situation would have been frustrating.
	</p>
	<p>
		The others apologised for my needing to stay, but I honestly didn&apos;t mind.
		I&apos;d been looking forward to leaving, though I didn&apos;t mention that, but it was worth staying just for the humour of the situation.
		Besides, it was only half an hour.
		Also, I didn&apos;t have to deal with the night assistant manager&apos;s attitude as they were gone, so it wasn&apos;t even a bad half hour.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of the night assistant manager, they threw another tantrum yesterday.
		Some employees in my area were speaking ill of them.
		I didn&apos;t get involved, and said nothing.
		Why should I stand up for the night assistant manager, when they insult me literally every day by referring to me as a man?
		And I&apos;ve told them that it hurts when people do that.
		But they don&apos;t care.
		They are directly hurting me, so as long as I&apos;m not directly hurting them (as that&apos;s just not who I am), I feel no remorse in not trying to stop others from hurting them.
		After their tantrum in which they directly attacked me, making themselves only the third workmate I&apos;ve ever actually been angry with, I don&apos;t even consider them an ally at this point, and won&apos;t consider them one until they learn to see me as a human being - full stop - and refer to me as one.
		Furthermore, all that was said, as far as I&apos;m aware, was simply that they were having another of their outbursts, which had in fact just happened.
		But when that was pointed out and I didn&apos;t stand up against the statement, that somehow makes <strong>*me*</strong> the problem.
		However, things are ... more complex now.
		The one shift-leaders-in-training seems to be trying to play mediator.
		And they&apos;ve now gotten the other shift-leader-in-training to actually start trying to stop referring to me as a man
		Even though that&apos;s not even related to the issues between the night assistant manager and me, it shows what effort they&apos;re putting in.
		Effort that I haven&apos;t had the strength to work on enough myself.
		Regardless of whether the night assistant manager decides to refer to me as an actual human being, I feel like I have to try to ... well, not patch things up with the night assistant manager, as that&apos;s all on them not me, but do my best to behave as though the situation is already patched up in my dealings with the night assistant manager.
		I&apos;ll try to put aside my beef with them, and do my best to keep them appeased, despite my own feelings on the matter.
		If they need someone to stand up for them, then fine.
		I&apos;ll do my best to do that from here on out, even if they refuse to meet my own, simpler need.

		I didn&apos;t feel like playing today, and didn&apos;t have time to anyway.
		So I just did a little bit of work on one of the mountains near the iceberg in order to show progress for the day on my map, then shut the game off.
