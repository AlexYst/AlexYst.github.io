	<p>
		I&apos;ve been growing more and more frustrated with the specifics of my grinding storage room.
		It&apos;s just not well-suited to the reality of resource-grinding.
		Some basic materials are represented, but several other resources aren&apos;t, especially furnace fuels.
		It makes long grinding sessions troublesome, as I end up with huge amounts of fuel that I don&apos;t have storage space for.
		As such, I started planning a new storage room that utilises the same maximum capacity, but divides it between a greater number of resources.
		The current goal is to decide on a set of resources with a count that the number of chests (3168; the number of chest that would fit in a chest) can be evenly divided by.
		25 resources are currently identified as being worth getting an alcove in the new storage layout, but as the number of chests can&apos;t be evenly divided by 25, that&apos;d mean making at least one of the alcoves a different size than the others.
		I suppose if need be though, the cobble alcove could be made one node deeper than the others, and that&apos;d perfectly make use of the planned capacity.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started moving items out of the mass storage room so I could strip out the walls, floors, and ceiling, fill the space with cobble, and dig the room out in the new shape.
		Optimisations would be performs so I wouldn&apos;t have to fill any parts of the room I&apos;d be digging out again, but the room would be moved one node higher, be dug deeper, and be made narrower in the <var>x</var> and <var>z</var> dimensions.
		Before I could get very far though, I decided against the procedure.
		Eliminating the original room would eliminate a piece of this world&apos;s history.
		I sort of want to archive how bad I am at building right now so when I come back years later, I can see the improvement.
		The storage room should be left how it is.
		However, it should also be abandoned.
		It might be time to move to a new base after all and see if I can use what I&apos;ve learned so far.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first thing I&apos;ve learned is that the grinding storage room has to be taken into account and planned for from the beginning.
		As an add-on, it&apos;s more difficult to build.
		Second, the grinding storage room needs to have alcoves for everything I&apos;d get while grinding that doesn&apos;t go into cold storage, without exception.
		I can&apos;t simply leave out furnace fuels just because I plan to burn them as soon as possible, as I may not actually be able to get to the burning any time soon.
		There might be nothing to cook, and the fuels need to be stored.
		They can&apos;t just be dropped in a separate, unsorted room, as I&apos;d want to dig through all the chests and burn whatever would free the most space.
		If sorted in the grinding storage room, I can either immediately locate the fuels I&apos;d prefer to burn or I can burn whatever I&apos;d need to clear space for more of in preparation for a future grind.
		Third, I shouldn&apos;t waste silver sand.
		Silver sand glass is completely unnecessary for window construction.
		Obsidian glass will due just fine and is in much lower demand.
		Fourth, fuels gotten from farming wood are in excess.
		Using more stone and less wood in construction is advisable.
		Now might even be a good time to look into building a small castle.
		Then again, I&apos;m kind of enamoured with the central shipping docks idea, so I may need to spend a lot of wood after all.
		Things aside from the docks themselves might be better off built from non-wooden materials though, and where feasible, it could be good to save wood on the docks, such as using stone bases for the support pillars.
		The upper parts of the pillars could be thin and wooden while the bases are wider and stone so it looks like the stone is there to help hold the pillars in place like the cement bases sometimes seen holding up wooden poles in the real world, but taller than most real-world examples
		Fifth, efficient farms aren&apos;t going to fit on-site, given how much water is present in the region of the world.
		Mass farms can be built elsewhere, so I shouldn&apos;t try to farm on-site.
		Sixth, there&apos;s no point in avoiding certain wool colours until I have blueberries at my disposal.
		Simply put, blueberry output will always be too high compared to wool output, and there will never be a way to catch up, at least given the current rules of Minetest Game, the relevant ones of which are unlikely to change any time soon.
		I might as well take advantage of the full wool spectrum.
		I&apos;ve learned a few techniques for making builds look a bit nicer, but other than that, I can&apos;t think of any more things I need to keep in mind when constructing the new base.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a side note, lining the diamond alcove with diamonds is going to cost 144 diamond blocks.
		I have less than a third of that at the moment.
	</p>
	<p>
		After trying to decide where to put the new base, I once again gave up on moving just yet.
		I want the secondary roads built first.
		I&apos;m thinking about building a rainbow over my next base, or maybe even my current base, the new base will need to wait.
		At the same time though, the storage room isn&apos;t working for me.
		So I&apos;ve decided that instead of restructuring it, I&apos;ll just use it differently than the way it&apos;s intended to be used.
		Each alcove will hold two types of item instead of one.
		On the left will be the intended material and on the right will be some other material, except for in the cobble alcove.
		That one will hold silver sand and obsidian, and stone won&apos;t be found in an alcove at all.
		I&apos;ll probably pile it in the centre of the room or something.
		This way, there&apos;ll actually be a place for everything I grind for.
		Or so I thought.
		I&apos;d forgotten that there&apos;s a missing alcove on one side; I have eleven alcoves, not twelve.
		So that idea would get me storage for 23 materials, not 25.
		I ended up dividing three of the alcoves into three parts each, and the rest by two.
		The three-item alcoves are used for non-cobble resources gotten when mining.
		It&apos;s a makeshift solution, but it&apos;ll do until I get the secondary roads built.
		At that point, I really should get a new base built.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oh yeah, I finally named the farming facility, too: Glacierbed Farms.
		I&apos;ve had that name for a few days now, but finally made it official with a sign.
