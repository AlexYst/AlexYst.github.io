	<p>
		I&apos;m basically living out of the northern facility for the time being, and living out of somewhere that hasn&apos;t even been fully constructed yet feels a bit odd.
		I&apos;ve set aside the goal of farming materials for chests for today, and instead worked on just finishing the facility.
		I switched the farm over from farming apple bushes to farming pine bushes to get materials for the walls and I set up a temporary orchard near the facility to get apple logs for the support pillars.
		I&apos;d actually forgotten that I had plenty of apple logs at home.
		I forget exactly what I was doing with them, but I needed a bunch of apple logs a while back and set up a temporary orchard in Corvia Village.
		I ended up with a surplus, and they&apos;d been sitting in my lesser storage room until I built the mass storage room and moved them there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I finished the facility.
		I didn&apos;t really come out as I&apos;d planned, partly because my imagination isn&apos;t strong enough to keep track of what things would look like from all angles at once, but I&apos;d say it came out decently.
		Aside form the fact that there aren&apos;t a whole lot of furnaces, this could even be a decent home.
		I doubt I&apos;ll typically need to mass cook here at the facility like I do at home though, so a smaller number of furnaces is just fine, especially as adding more would disrupt the visual aesthetic.
		This inside&apos;s a bit dumb-looking at joint of the build where one part juts out from the other, this is something I&apos;ll get better with with a bit of practice.
	</p>
	<p>
		For now, it&apos;s time to get back to the resource grind so I can stock the facility with the chests it needs to operate at full capacity, then stock the storeroom back home with the chests it needs as well.
		I feel a bit encumbered without storeroom chests.
		I could grind for materials for a bit, but would quickly have to switch tasks when I run out of boxes to put things in.
		I think my short-term plan is as follows.
		I&apos;ll finish building up my chest stock, then grind a bit more for some excess bush stems.
		The wood can be useful for making torches and even for making chests that aren&apos;t part of the storeroom set.
		Minerals I dig up, for example, aren&apos;t stored in the main storeroom, and aren&apos;t stored in the storeroom&apos;s chests.
		Then I&apos;ll go mining.
		For days and days, probably, filling the cobble alcove in the storeroom.
		I&apos;ll end up with a lot of silver sand in the process, which I&apos;ll then use to lay out the paths for the secondary roads.
		Finally, I&apos;ll build the secondary roads, having all the cobble I could ever need for the project already in my storeroom, until I run out of furnace fuel for processing said cobble into stone blocks and stone bricks.
		I&apos;ll then switch over to cotton-farming and partly fill the cotton alcove.
		All the while, I&apos;ll be using the string from the harvests as fuel to cook more stone.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hmm.
		Now that I think on it, doing the cotton-farming before the bridge-building might be a better idea, so as to have the strings to burn right from the start.
		Strings are the least-efficient fuel, so burning strings clears up the most chest space.
