	<h2>Tomatoes?</h2>
	<p>
		For probably a few weeks now, I&apos;ve been watching a plant that&apos;s been living in the crack between the pavement and the back of the building I work in.
		I&apos;ve been kind of thinking the leaves look like tomato leaves, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d seriously considered the idea that a tomato might have taken root outside the building.
		We don&apos;t exactly have any wild tomatoes nearby that could have spread their seeds here or anything like that.
		I finally took a photograph of the plant yesterday, and included it in my journal entry.
	</p>
	<p>
		I happened to step outside to recycle some cardboard while a the night assistant manager and one of the shift-leaders-in-training were on break today, and I asked something to the effect of &quot;Is it just me, or does this look like a tomato?&quot;.
		The shift-leader-in-training agreed, and said that they raise tomatoes, so they&apos;d know what they look like.
		The continued that we should let it live and see if it bears fruit.
		I hadn&apos;t even considered killing it, honestly.
		It&apos;s not exactly bothering anyone, and I tend to get sad when I see fields/lawns get mowed, or when trees and bushes get trimmed.
		Outright killing plants isn&apos;t something I tend to do without reason.
		At this point, I started thinking that maybe it actually <strong>*is*</strong> a tomato, so I wondered aloud how it might have gotten there.
		Maybe a seed from our marinara had inexplicably survived and somehow ended up outside the building and gotten bumped into the crack?
		The shift-leader-in-training pointed out that we have whole tomato fruits in the building.
		Oh.
		Right.
		I&apos;d forgotten about that.
		That&apos;d be a better explanation, seeing as those&apos;d be source of uncooked seeds that&apos;d likely still be alive.
		I later showed my fellow enby that I work with and mentioned that we hypothesised that it might be a tomato, and they replied that they&apos;d been wondering about it.
		It didn&apos;t look like any weed they&apos;d ever seen.
	</p>
	<p>
		I took a closer look at the plant as I headed out on my way home, and noticed that there are actually two plants there.
		We might have two tomatoes.
		Also, they&apos;re starting to develop flower buds.
		I wasn&apos;t really sure what tomato flowers look like, but I was sure tomatoes do flower, seeing as you can still see the remaining sepals around the fruits after the flowers die away and the fruits develop.
		The sepals on the plants are long ant pointy though, like you&apos;d see around the fruit.
		Once home, I looked up what tomato flowers look like, and they&apos;re yellow, just like what I could see of the flowers on the unidentified plants.
		So these things probably actually are tomatoes.
		That&apos;s kind of funny.
		Seeds from the produce probably found their way outside, and a couple made it to somewhere somewhat hospitable for life.

		I&apos;ve led the coniferous litter to both the new major holes in the ice sheet so I can fill the area with bush-farming land as I slowly clear out the glacier ice.
