	<h2>Gender-fluid</h2>
	<p>
		One of my workmates has a non-binary fiancé.
		Predictably, they&apos;re one of the few people that even bothers to try to not misgender me, and they&apos;re the only one I&apos;ve noticed that doesn&apos;t seem to ever accidentally misgender me anyway.
		They actually care, as it&apos;s a subject they actually care about for other reasons.
		Today, they mentioned that they&apos;re gender-fluid themself, but have only lately been thinking much about using &quot;they&quot;/&quot;them&quot; pronouns.
		Previously, they thought it wouldn&apos;t be acceptable for them to use them.
		It&apos;s a shame people feel boxed in like that.
		It&apos;s interesting to know that they&apos;re another one of us queers though.
		And as I always say, &quot;they&quot;/&quot;them&quot; pronouns are for everyone.
		Even for people strongly tied to a binary gender, &quot;they&quot;/&quot;them&quot; pronouns don&apos;t assert a lack of binary gender, they just don&apos;t assert a binary gender.
		It&apos;s like if I don&apos;t say that there&apos;s a tree in my yard.
		It&apos;s not the same thing as saying that there <strong>*isn&apos;t*</strong> a tree in my yard.
	</p>
	<p>
		Come to think of it, they do prefer to go by a nickname that&apos;s pretty gender-neutral.
		I hadn&apos;t really noticed that before.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

		I finished laying my sandstone, dirt, and snow around the islands.
		I&apos;m out of the stuff now.
		Before I get back to working on the island where I&apos;ve been getting more dirt and snow, I have a few other things I want to get done first.
		I&apos;m running out of cobble, so I went on a mining expedition today to get a bit more.
		I&apos;m still really short on cobble compared to what I had before; I&apos;ve got less than a chest of the stuff.
		What I&apos;ve noticed both this trip and my last trip though was that I&apos;ve gotten to the point that I&apos;m mining a bit of mese, but I&apos;m making hardly any progress in deepening the mine.
		That means not too many powered rails are being laid.
		I think it&apos;s safe to start laying more rails in the overworld.
		I should have plenty of mese to build new rails by the time I need them for the mine, as long as I set aside a stash of rails to make it to the next cave.
		I&apos;d like to get started on laying these overworld rails, as it&apos;ll speed up travel considerably.
	</p>
	<p>
		My main bridge isn&apos;t complete, and before I get the rails laid, I need more pinewood to build the part of the bridge the rails will rest on.
		I kind of might continue ignoring the missing fences along the sides of the bridge acting as guard rails, but I should finish the entire walkable part of the bridge as I add the rails on top of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I want to get my silver sand laid out in the riverbed.
		Now that I&apos;m not digging as far down in the trenches around the islands I&apos;m not focusing on, I don&apos;t need all that much silver sand on hand at the moment, so I should put it in place and clear out inventory space.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of clearing up inventory space, I&apos;ve got a lot of unprocessed metal, which can&apos;t be properly compressed into blocks.
		It takes up more space in the chests than I&apos;d like it to.
		I should do some more cotton farming to get the string I typically use for furnace fuel.
		The flip side of that is that it&apos;ll generate a lot of wool too, which I don&apos;t need at the moment.
		I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;ll end up needing more chests or less chests when I&apos;m done with that.
		If you count all the seeds produced, it&apos;ll be more for sure, but I don&apos;t have to store the seed chests in my home, so I guess those don&apos;t really matter.
		In either case, my home chests will be more organised with the metal having been processed, so getting that done seems like a good idea.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been thinking about a potential companion mod for a few weeks at least to go with <code>liblevelup</code> in place of the many-times-defunct <code>minequest</code> .
		I haven&apos;t really talked about it because, like all the others before it, it&apos;ll probably fall through.
		Likewise, even if it works out, I won&apos;t want it in my main world.
		It&apos;s too active.
		It does too much.
		It&apos;s still rather neat though.
		But anyway, as can be expected, it depends on the levelling mechanics provided by <code>liblevelup</code>, so it would be helpful for players to know their levels and how much they need to harvest to increase them.
		I think I&apos;ve come up with a great interface for displaying that sort of information as well as provide recommendations to players.
		I think I&apos;d like to split that interface off into its own mod, like I did with <code>liblevelup</code>, which was originally a part of <code>minequest</code>.
		I want that interface in my world.
		I think this will be the next layer of what <code>liblevelup</code> is supposed to be.
		I still don&apos;t know what the final product is, but with this coded, I think I&apos;ll be a bit closer to whatever unknown end goal I&apos;m working toward.
