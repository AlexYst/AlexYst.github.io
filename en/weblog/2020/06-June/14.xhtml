	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that whenever I&apos;d pop a pimple, I&apos;d find a small, metal object in my skin.
		I pulled out things such as tiny screws, tiny nuts, hair brush bristles, and things of that nature.
		I was really confused as to how those things got in there.
		One particularly large screw turned out to be surrounded by a pocket of quite a bit of liquid, which took some time to squeeze out.
		I became very confused as to how something so large would have ended up embedded in my skin without my noticing.
		I had no wounds from entry, only from exit, which didn&apos;t make any sense to me.
		None of these things should have ended up in me without leaving a mark and without being noticed.
		This dream felt so real though.

	<h2>Bike stuff</h2>
	<p>
		My front inner tube is leaking air badly again.
		I don&apos;t know what&apos;s with me and getting frequent flats.
		I really need to make time to patch my tubes though, as I&apos;m out of good tubes.
	</p>
	<p>
		My old bike pump died on me a while back, so I just pulled out a second one someone had given me.
		Now that one&apos;s leaking air out the plunger end more than it puts air in the tire, so that&apos;s not helpful.
		I have a third pump, which I haven&apos;t been using because it lacks a pressure gauge.
		I found out today though that that pump doesn&apos;t even work well anyway.
		It&apos;s ancient-looking, so I guess that shouldn&apos;t surprise me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried picking up another tire pump at the second-hand store on my break, but no dice.
		They didn&apos;t have one.
		I&apos;ll have to hit up an actual bike store and spring for a new one.
		I thought about continuing to put this off - I&apos;ve been having tire issues for a few days now - and just walking to work.
		That wouldn&apos;t save me time though, it&apos;d cost me time.
		Walking is slow.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was in there, I was going to check for pants too.
		The dressing rooms are closed due to the pandemic though.
		Pants-shopping will have to be put off even longer.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I&apos;ve started to clean up the area beneath the ice in preparation for being used for something.
		I decided to just add black carpeting and black windows.
		I figured the black would contrast nicely with the white snow.
		I still haven&apos;t decided what to do with the area just yet, but I can&apos;t just leave it a mess.
		If I did, it&apos;d look like an abandoned project.
		I want it to look complete, to an extent.
		There&apos;s a difference between abandoned office space and an abandoned building project.
		At least with the abandoned office space, the area was fully built, it just isn&apos;t really being used.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having decided how to deal with the space for now, I still thought about future use so I could perhaps make more-fitting design choices.
		My first idea was to build the church of the Cult of the Squid here.
		Perhaps they&apos;d excavated and rescued the Great Squiddy, and now worship here.
		It&apos;s a nice idea, at first glance, but the area isn&apos;t really fit for nice architecture.
		The only reason I want to build a church at all is for the architecture.
		I&apos;m an atheist.
		Aside from the beauty, what use do I have for a church?
		So the church of the Cult of the Squid can&apos;t go here.
		My main other idea was to divide the space up into separate offices or something.
		The problem with doing that though is that I can&apos;t yet know what size of rooms I&apos;ll need or how I&apos;ll want the space divided.
		A bare-bones setup with no walls would be best for now.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought about it some more before I got started, and decided to use white carpeting instead of black.
		It might look more like space that&apos;s ready to be rented out or purposed that way.
		When I tried that though, the white carpets just didn&apos;t look good at all next to the snow though.
		So I went back to the black carpets.
		I&apos;m going to need a lot more obsidian for these windows though, including the windows in the floor that will make the caves below visible.
		I <strong>*vastly*</strong> overestimated how many stone blocks I&apos;d need to build the boarder of the building, and ended up cooking just about all my cobble.
		I&apos;ll need to get more from the mine.
		I&apos;m starting to question the idea of the obsidian glass windows though.
		Perhaps stone and wood bars would be better.
