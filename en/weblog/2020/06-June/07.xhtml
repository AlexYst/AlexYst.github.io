<section id="toxicity">
	<h2>Toxicity</h2>
	<p>
		I stumbled upon a page on toxic parenting today that I wasn&apos;t even looking for.
		The title caught my eye though, so I took a look.
		Wow.
		Summer is worse than I&apos;d realised.
		She&apos;s pretty much a textbook case of a toxic parent.
		But also, I&apos;ve been questioning how much I might be overreacting to her poor behaviours.
		I&apos;m under-reacting though.
		I&apos;m under-reacting by a long shot.
	</p>
	<p>
		I learned quite a bit from the page.
		To start with, parent toxicity stems from narcissism.
		I guess I already knew much of Summer&apos;s toxicity was related to her narcissism, but I don&apos;t think I thought about the narcissism being the root of the problem quite as much as is the case.
		Every toxic behaviour she exhibits can actually be traced back to her narcissism.
		There are a lot of lifelong effects a toxic parent can have on a child.
		One that caught my attention was that the victims of toxic parents tend to either self-sabotage or be willing to give up everything in the name of a lofty goal.
		I guess I shouldn&apos;t talk about the lofty goal thing because it&apos;s not my goal but the goal of a sibling, but Summer has gotten rather frustrated about how she thinks one of her children is throwing away everything to work toward what they see as a lofty goal and she sees as foolishness.
		And I&apos;ve wondered before myself if said goal - while I do agree that it&apos;s a noble and worthwhile cause - is so important to them partly because we were all made feel how insignificant we are.
		Why not throw away everything you have to better humanity when all you really are anyway is worthless garbage?
		The loss of a bit of trash is nothing compared to the good that could be achieved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing brought up was the dual nature of gifts from such parents.
		If we ever accepted gifts or help from Summer, she made it out like we owed her.
		But if we turned down said gifts or help, we were made out to be ungrateful.
		There was no way for us to win.
		We&apos;d often only take the gifts or help, if we even did, because she wanted to give them.
		We didn&apos;t even want or need them in most cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		She frequently went through our stuff.
		We had no privacy from her.
		She had to know everything, and she had to have a say in everything.
		We weren&apos;t really allowed to be ourselves, even in private.
		She has no concept of other people&apos;s personal boundaries, especially the personal boundaries of her children.
		And you know what?
		Such parents usually try to get keys to their children&apos;s homes when they move out so they can continue to violate their boundaries.
		Sound familiar?
		I <strong>*knew*</strong> I didn&apos;t want her having a key, but she managed to make me feel sorry for her and feel like she was trying to do better.
		It was probably intentional manipulation, in retrospect.
	</p>
	<p>
		We were always having to play emotional support for Summer to the point that I didn&apos;t even go away to a real college because I thought I had to be there to support Summer.
		At the same time though, our opinions were always disregarded and belittled.
		We didn&apos;t have the right to have our own thoughts and opinions.
		She always made us feel like constant disappointments to her, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		She always tried to get us to tell her what we thought and how we felt, but she&apos;d also berate us when we did.
		She wanted us to give her ammunition to hit us with.
		She&apos;d pry information out of us too, even if said information was of no use to her, then often treat that private information like it was hers to share with whomever she felt like.
		Myself, I ended up faking interests I never had just so she couldn&apos;t use my real interest against me while giving her the illusion that she had the information she wanted.
		To stay on her good side to an extent, much of the interest I faked would be with what she herself had an interest in.
		I got so good at it even that she even tried giving me a couple gifts based on her own interests, even though they were so radically in opposition to my own morality, a morality I was never any good at hiding.
		I guess, a good way to put it is that I expressed an interest in her interest in something, but also expressed an objection to me ever doing the same thing, but my ability to express fake interest was stronger than my objections.
	</p>
	<p>
		The lowering of self-esteem was an issue discussed by the page as well.
		I always thought it a byproduct of Summer&apos;s disregard for our mental and emotional well-being.
		It seems that&apos;s not the case at all.
		It was a deliberate and intentional move by her, which is why she was so good at tearing us down.
		A depressed child with a low sense of self-worth is much easier to control.
		This is typical behaviour for a toxic parent, and is something that has had a lasting impact on me.
		Many of the wounds she left on my psyche still haven&apos;t healed.
	</p>
	<p>
		She liked to have full control of what we did too, yet, if we did everything she wanted and it didn&apos;t work out the way she planned, it was our fault for doing it.
		And if we didn&apos;t do what she wanted, it was also our fault things didn&apos;t play out the way she wanted them to, of course.
		There was just no way to win with her.
	</p>
	<p>
		She always liked to play both sides, making it out like we were holding her back, and that we were the most terrible thing in her life.
		But at the same time, she wanted to take inordinate amounts of our attention all the time to the point where she actually made me fail out of my first online school.
		A school far less toxic than the one I&apos;m at now, and more expensive too.
		I ended up having to pay of student debt for a degree I failed to complete because she wanted to keep me away from my studies and socialise.
	</p>
	<p>
		After coming across all that information, I&apos;m even happier that I decided to change the lock on my front door to keep her out.
		I&apos;m also even more determined to reclaim my living room from her.
		I&apos;m not sure how far away vocal therapy is for me.
		As much as I want to sound more like me when she confronts me about her stuff showing back up at her place, it may not be the best idea to wait after all, particularly with the local university closed due to the current pandemic.
		I don&apos;t think I should act just yet.
		I need to get everything out of here that I can of my own to clear space and give me more time to think on this.
		I also want to look into more-effective ways to transport her stuff.
		I think I&apos;ll spend my next break between terms getting her stuff out though.
	</p>

<section id="orders">
	<h2>Cancelled orders</h2>
	<p>
		I spent the day trying to order power cords for my laptops before work.
		I&apos;ve got one cord between the two laptops, and it&apos;s in pretty bad shape.
		I already knew I needed a replacement, but now I need a second cord too, so I tried to order two of them.
		The website I tried to order from kept accepting my order, putting a hold on my card, then cancelling the order on me.
		They claim it&apos;s because they can&apos;t verify my payment details, but you <strong>*know*</strong> that that&apos;s a lie.
		Putting the hold on my card required that the details I gave them be correct.
		That means that by putting the hold on my card, they <strong>*did*</strong> verify my payment details, whether that was the intent of the hold or not.
	</p>
	<p>
		I dealt with support, who said they fixed the issue.
		They said to wait at least thirty minutes but no longer than twenty-four hours, then try the order again.
		I got distracted and ended up waiting about an hour, but my next order got cancelled as well.
		I&apos;ll probably spend tomorrow dealing with their garbage and trying to get them to sell me the cords.
		I can only find two sites that sell them, and the other site locked me out of my account for no valid reason and there doesn&apos;t seem to be a way to contact them about the issue.
		That means this site is the only option I&apos;ve got for getting these cords unless I can find a shop in town that would have cords for really old laptops.

	<p>
		I spent a bit of time working on the trench around the island.
		Not a whole lot though.
