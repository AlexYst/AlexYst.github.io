<section id="redemption">
	<h2>Bottle redemption</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t have the time to get rid of all the cans and bottles that have been spilling out of bags throughout my apartment today, though I didn&apos;t think I would.
		I did manage to get four large bags of the things gone though.
		That has made a major difference.

<section id="trans">
	<h2>Mistaken as a transwoman</h2>
	<p>
		I got mistaken as a transwoman by a very polite stranger while I was out today.
		I think it was the purse.
		And the nails.
		And the breasts.
		It&apos;s always a pleasant change to be mistaken as a woman than mistaken as a man, though it&apos;d be nice if I could be seen as the enby I am.
	</p>

<section id="no">
	<h2>&quot;No&quot; means &quot;no&quot;</h2>
	<p>
		I was covering the drive-through worker&apos;s break today, and someone at the menu board asked if they could order at the window.
		I told them no, and that we take drive-through orders at the menu board, not the window.
		They then proceeded to pull away from the menu board and straight up to the window without ordering first.
		Seriously?
		No.
		Not happening.
		I told them again at the window that we don&apos;t take orders at the window, and that they have to order at the menu board.
		They seemed confused as to why I wouldn&apos;t just take their order at the window, but that&apos;s what happens when you disregard instructions given to you.
		&quot;No&quot; means &quot;no&quot;.
		By pulling up to the window after being told not to, they&apos;d wasted their time sitting through our long drive-through line.
		I don&apos;t know whether they pulled back around and tried again, this time with the drive-through worker off break; they came in the front to skip the line, as we didn&apos;t have a line in our lobby and frequently don&apos;t even when there&apos;s a line in the drive-through lane; or they simply left.
		Whatever the case, I hope they learned their lesson in drive-through etiquette and/or basic not pushing your way when you&apos;re told &quot;no&quot;.
		Normally, if someone misses the menu board, I don&apos;t make them go all the way back around, but it&apos;s different when you ask to skip the menu board at the menu board, are told &quot;no&quot;, and do it anyway.
		If I let you get your way when you do that, I&apos;m rewarding and reinforcing your &quot;no&quot;-means&quot;yes&quot; mentality.

		Freya wrote, asking to borrow another $500 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		That brings her debt up to $2904 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		This is starting to get ridiculous.

	<p>
		I finished up the trench around the island I was working at.
		I&apos;m not sure if I have less dirt in my inventory to deal with now or somehow more.
		Anyway, it&apos;s time to head to the next island to fill/dig another trench.
