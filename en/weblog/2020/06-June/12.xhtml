	<h2>Bottles</h2>
	<p>
		The bottle-redemption centre has had quite a line the last couple times I went in.
		The problem is that with the pandemic happening, many of the bottle machines have had to be closed down because they&apos;re too close together.
		They&apos;re simply not the three metres apart and my region is recommending people stay that far away from one another.
		It seems the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">World Health Organisation is recommending one metre</a>, but my area seems to be focussing on three metres for some reason.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I&apos;ve been a bit reluctant to go redeem bottles again with the long wait times.
		I&apos;ve got better things to do than just stand in line.
		I realised I&apos;ve got a solution here at home though.
		I&apos;ve been having to keep my stuff out of the living room so Summer can store things there, but she&apos;s locked out of my home now.
		She left pathways through her junk so she can get to whatever she needs.
		I can&apos;t really store anything I need to get to there, but I can certainly put the bags of bottles there until the pandemic clears up enough for business to return to normal.

		I&apos;m starting to get a bad feeling about how much space it&apos;ll take to store all the ice I need to harvest.
		I&apos;ve rearranged the larger storage room, putting all the ice against the southern wall and everything else against the northern wall.
		I&apos;m going to just keep stacking ice chests along the southern wall in layers until it reaches the doorway.
		At that point, I&apos;ll probably move all the non-ice chests to the smaller room and stack ice chests against the northern wall until that too reaches the doorway.
		Finally, I&apos;ll stack against the western wall all the way to the doorway.
		I don&apos;t think that&apos;ll be enough space though.
		I&apos;ll need to put ice chests somewhere else too.
		I might need to build a new room.

		I left my game open overnight with the railway modified to send me back and forth in a cart through the blocks I needed the coniferous litter to spread through in hops of keeping them loaded so it&apos;d spread.
		The coniferous litter made almost no progress while I slept though.
		Perhaps the blocks were unloading even though they were about to be reloaded, so the <abbr title="Active Block Modifier">ABM</abbr>s weren&apos;t going off.
		Or something.
		I don&apos;t know.
		Eventually, to speed the process today, I temporarily thickened the path I was having the foresty debris spread across and crafted a trio of mese lampposts so it&apos;d spread even at night.
		I sort of kept an eye on the spread as I did other things so I&apos;d know when to move the posts to the next spot.
		Of course, I couldn&apos;t leave the area, so I couldn&apos;t be productive in-game.
		To remedy this a bit, I set up a makeshift bush farm out on the water.
		That way, my waiting could actually produce wood to work with too.
		I&apos;ve been crafting a lot of torches and chests, and I need materials for that.
