		Freya wrote, asking to borrow another $500 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		That brings her debt up to $3404 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		Her requests for money are getting much more frequent.
		She seems to be falling into the hole worse and worse now.

	<h2><code>bailey</code> is dying</h2>
	<p>
		For the past several days, <a href="/en/domains/bailey.local.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a> has been freaking out.
		It keeps jumping the cursor to random positions on the screen, usually one of the corners.
		It&apos;s getting rather aggravating.
		I think <code>bailey</code> might be dying.
		It could be time to look for a new spare laptop.
		I can migrate to <a href="/en/domains/charlie.local.xhtml"><code>charlie</code></a> at any time, but I need a spare machine for if <code>charlie</code> dies too.
		Especially once school is back in session, I can&apos;t afford to be without a computer.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve finished the main bridges of World&apos;s Navel!
		Of course, the islands aren&apos;t all connected yet.
		The auxiliary bridges will need to take care of that, and those aren&apos;t complete yet.
		Those are a project for another time though, and I don&apos;t feel I can even start a bridge to an island unless that island is prepared, so I&apos;ll know exactly where the best place to connect a bridge to is.
		It&apos;s different than the main bridges, which can just connect where they connect.
		With the main roads, the point is the road, and if the island is in the way, it gets plowed through.
		With the auxiliary bridges, the bridge is specifically there for the benefit of accessing the island.
		What&apos;s best for the island is what&apos;s important.
	</p>
	<p>
		After completing the bridge, mining, laying more silver sand in the riverbed, and farming a bit of string to cook metal lumps with, I worked on mining glacier ice under the ice sheet.
		Honestly, it doesn&apos;t feel very productive because it doesn&apos;t even show up on the overhead map.
		I mean, one of my main goals is to make visible progress on the map each day.
		I did that with the bridge, so I&apos;m more than good for today, but I can&apos;t really keep going on the ice-mining as the only project I work on on a given day.
		I set up a bit of a temporary base of operations on the end of the northern bridge, but it&apos;s really a moot point, as I can&apos;t stay there a week or so and actually clear out all the glacier ice.
		I&apos;ve got to go do something else, such as work on preparing one of the islands.
		I might try to do a little visible work each day while spending most of my game time under the ice sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not really sure what I want to do in the space I&apos;m clearing.
		For the most part, I don&apos;t have to decide any time soon, but I should probably at a minimum figure out what to cove the ground with.
		Silver sand is the obvious choice.
		The area is below sea level.
		I could flood it when I reintroduce the ocean I&apos;m in the process of removing.
		At the same time though, I think the area is surrounded on all sides so water can&apos;t flow in unless I put it in.
		I&apos;m <strong>*extremely*</strong> short on silver sand, and I&apos;m going to need a <strong>*huge*</strong> amount of the stuff.
		It could be a better idea to use dirt instead and lead in some coniferous litter.
		I&apos;ve started leading it there, just leaving the game open while I&apos;m doing other things so it spreads across the dams made of dirt beside the bridge.
		I still need to think about it same more before I actually lay any new dirt, but I think using dirt is my best option.
		Another thing I&apos;ve considered though is paving the area, such as with stone blocks.
		I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;d explain why the place is practically tiled though.
		I&apos;m not sure there&apos;s something I could put there that&apos;d allow that to make any sense whatsoever.
