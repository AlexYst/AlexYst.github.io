		I still hadn&apos;t figured out how to make effective use of the space on the inventory page my new mod adds.
		I knew if I let that stop me form coding the mod though, the mod wouldn&apos;t get done.
		So I coded the mod anyway.
		To be honest, it looked rather bad.
		I figured it might help if I came up with more information to display to use up some of the empty space so things didn&apos;t need to be so spread apart.
		For the time being, the mod wasn&apos;t really in a releasable condition.
		Still, it did everything I wanted from it.
		I mean, I thought about some features that would need to depend on hard-coded drops, but none of those features are worth the fact that the mod would lose all its flexibility.
		As far as a mod with great flexibility, this mod had what I would want in my own world.
		In a foreign world, I could see wanting a list of the available drops so I could hunt them down, but I think it might be better not to have that.
		For now, this mod expressly does not show a player drops that they haven&apos;t yet found on their own yet.
		This mod will be replacing in my world both the Awards mod and the mod that was keeping track of my mushroom harvests.
		I&apos;ll probably put the Awards mod back when I eventually do some streaming and/or video production.
	</p>
	<p>
		A bit later, I decided I wanted to be able to see all the drops displayed in order of how few of them I&apos;d gathered.
		Or more accurately, my level progression for each.
		However, I also thought it could be annoying for other players if the drops change order depending on what you&apos;ve been mining and farming.
		With that in mind, I added sorting order buttons, with one option being what I wanted, and defaulted to sorting by item code.
		Other options included sorting by name and sorting by rarity, with rarity-based sorting being what I&apos;m after.
		This eliminated an entire row of space, and actually made the mod look a lot better.
		I might come up with better design ideas with time, but I think the mod is now in a releasable state.
		I won&apos;t release it just yet, and will probably wait until I&apos;ve found at least one of each drop and/or I&apos;m releasing a mod that gives players a reason to care about their levels.
		It could be a year or more before either one of those things happens.
		For now, this mod will help me know what to target in my resource-gathering.
		Upon opening the page, it immediately recommends a drop to hunt for, which is the drop I&apos;ve found the least of while having found at least one of.
		Originally, that was just a built-in feature, but once I added the sorting options, I changed it to display the first item in the list.
		When sorting by code or name, this first item is constant, but when sorting by rarity, it&apos;s the drop you&apos;re the lowest level at harvesting and in case of a tie, the one you&apos;re farthest from levelling up.
		The mod also lets me see which wood sources I&apos;ve farmed the least so I know what to grow.
		The only down side to the current capabilities is that the mod won&apos;t ignore surface-specific resources in its recommendations, which is something the hard-coded version had been planned to do.
		I mean, the surface is so thin, so once you&apos;ve cleared out an area, there&apos;s nothing more to do but expand outward, which isn&apos;t my goal.
		With farmables, you can grow more, and with minerals, you can dig deeper, but neither option is available for things such as glacier ice and dry dirt.
	</p>
	<p>
		While testing, I found that sorting by name is broken.
		Things were sorted in an order that seemed dependant on the mod that defined the items, which should only be the case for the item codes, not the human-readable names.
		It took ages to debug, but I finally found the cause.
		The strings holding the human-readable names - or the descriptions, according to the Minetest <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> - are in a funky format that allows for client-side translation of strings.
		It&apos;s rather awesome, actually.
		It means a well-written mod can provide a way for at least the short strings to display in the language of the player, rather than in the language of the server.
		However, the bizarre formatting throws off the sorting.
		I tried to come up with a way around it at first, but quickly realised that any workaround would necessarily pick a specific language as defined by the server.
		It wouldn&apos;t allow sorting based on the client&apos;s language, as the information needed to sort in terms of the client&apos;s language would be available only to the client, which wouldn&apos;t be allowed to do the sorting.
		I ended up having to get rid of the by-name sorting option, which was disappointing.
