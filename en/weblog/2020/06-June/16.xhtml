	<h2>Tire pump</h2>
	<p>
		The tire pump I bought yesterday really isn&apos;t working out.
		The compact size is awesome.
		However, in addition to the lack of a pressure gauge, the compact size also means it doesn&apos;t have the force to pump much air without a lot of effort from the user.
		I don&apos;t know the exact mechanics of it, but it seems similar to trying to work with a lever that&apos;s too short.
		A longer lever offers more power with less effort.
		It&apos;s great to keep on-hand for an unexpected flat while travelling, but I need a full-size pump for normal use too.
		Unfortunately, I know for a fact that the only full-sized pumps the bike shop had when I checked yesterday were expensive, fancy ones.
		It looks like I&apos;m settling for one of the shoddy ones from the department store instead.
		They aren&apos;t great, but they&apos;ve got the size to actually get work done and they&apos;re fairly inexpensive.
	</p>
	<p>
		I nearly made the same mistake today that I did yesterday, and got one without a pressure gauge.
		I was so focused on making sure I got one of those large, plunger-style pumps that I forgot to check for a pressure gauge before the employee had nearly locked the case back up.

	<p>
		As I mentioned before, I&apos;d like to start either streaming or producing video, either way being Minetest gameplay, once I&apos;m in vocal therapy.
		One series I&apos;d like to do will be about completing the tasks laid out by the Awards mod.
		As I mentioned before though, there are certain awards I wouldn&apos;t want to deal with in my main world.
		I suggested copying the world data after completing everything else, then going nuts with the final few.
		I&apos;ve come up with a better idea though.
		At first, the idea was to build a machine that would supposedly let me hop to other dimensions through the power of video editing.
		Award data would be shared across worlds.
		<code>liblevelup</code> data would be shared one-way, with only things occurring in the main world actually counting in any world.
		I then thought about the possibility of instead setting up a virtual reality simulation machine.
		The idea would be identical, except that the other worlds would clearly be subordinate to the main world.
		If I visit public servers at any point, the server worlds would clearly be distinct places separate from but equal to my world, where the virtual reality worlds would be offshoots unable to exist on their own.
		There were things I could do with the alternate worlds that I couldn&apos;t do with virtual worlds though, such as get stranded there.
		Story-wise, alternate dimensions seemed like the better option.
		I&apos;ve come up with an even better idea though: pocket dimensions.
		These would clearly be subordinate to the main world, but also separate enough that I can do whatever I want, story-wise.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I first decided that other worlds might be the way to go, I immediately figured that I could expand the goal by including goals that the Awards mod provides only when certain mods are installed.
		Those mods don&apos;t exist in the main world, but they could in another world.
		That concept carried on to work even better (in my opinion) in the virtual reality form of the idea, and it still works decently enough when it comes to pocket dimensions.
		I think this is going to work out pretty well.
		I took a look at what mods the Awards mod supports though ...
		On that list is Unified Inventory.
		I&apos;m really not a fan of that mod.
		At all.
		It should be fine for just the short time I spend in that pocket dimension though.
		It&apos;s not likely to take too long.
		I&apos;ll have some resource-gathering, both to get the materials for the goals set by the Awards mod and get the materials for building the machine needed to escape the pocket dimension, but I won&apos;t likely be building any large structures or anything like that.
