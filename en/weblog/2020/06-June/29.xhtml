		I have a new idea for the barge.
		Maybe it shouldn&apos;t have any shipping containers, but should instead just have piles of the materials exposed to the open air with chests of the materials down inside the piles.
		That won&apos;t really work for the mushrooms or apples though, so I&apos;ll have to think about this some more.
	</p>
	<p>
		The mine is going to take a lot of furnace fuel to construct, as I plan to actually build a stone box around it made from not only cobble, but also stone blocks and stone bricks.
		Each stone block or brick will take three points of furnace fuel to produce.
		Plus, I&apos;ll need to haul loads of cobble out of the mine to the point that it&apos;s the resource I have the most of.
		Using it only in cobble form would make for boring builds.
		Having stone blocks and stone bricks for other projects to would make it more useful.
		That means even more furnace fuel, but I also need to budget my time.
		I can harvest more strings to burn or I can go mine more cobble.
		Also, if I choose the strings, I&apos;ll have even more wool nodes to use, and I mostly only use wool for carpets.
		It&apos;s not something I use much of for now.
		With all that in mind, I think I&apos;m finally going to start burning my saplings as furnace fuel.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I burn my saplings as furnace fuel, I&apos;ll need to retire the old cold storage facility and build a smaller one that only stores the items that truly are completely useless.
		That&apos;d be kelp, which can&apos;t be placed anywhere in the world due to lack of beach sand, and it can only be placed on beach sand for technical reasons; flint, which can only be crafted into tools, but is finite in quantity so I can&apos;t actually waste it on tools; and farm seeds, which are very useful in small quantities, but if you have too many of them, there&apos;s absolutely no use whatsoever for the excess ones.
		I guess mushroom spores could be added to that list, as you can&apos;t do anything with the excess spores either, though they stack so high that it won&apos;t become relevant until far into the future.
		By that logic though, maybe kelp shouldn&apos;t count either.
		I&apos;ll probably never have even a single chest of kelp and mushroom spores combined.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I can&apos;t have the cold storage facility being only partly in use, so it&apos;s got to be retired and replaced or I&apos;ve got to keep stashing the saplings.
		Retiring it will also give me a chance to move it to a more-central location too, such as near the new base at Crossroad Isle.
		I&apos;ve been regretting building the cold storage facility so far out for quite a while, but I&apos;ve also been extremely reluctant to tear it down and build a new one.
		I don&apos;t mind building a new one, and tearing down the old one would even let me reclaim materials, but I don&apos;t want to destroy old builds.
		That&apos;s sort of the whole point in not starting over the game any more.
		Abandoning the old facility instead of tearing it down is fine though, and it retains the scar of the bad decision I originally made.
		I think one day though, I&apos;ll convert it into something new, retaining most of the current structure.
		It might have a big glass tube with seven smaller glass tubes inside.
		On top, there&apos;d be a structure that looks like the current stone base, but flipped upside-down.
		I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;d use that for, but it sounds like it&apos;d look pretty neat.
