	<h2>Tucking tape</h2>
	<p>
		When I first looked up instructions on how to tuck, I could only find instructions that fell into one of three categories: those involving gaffs, those involving cutting up old tube socks and pantyhose, and those involving duct tape.
		I tried a gaff, but couldn&apos;t get it working.
		I didn&apos;t want to buy new pantyhose just to cut them up, and I&apos;ve never worn any, so I don&apos;t have any worn-out ones like the instructions suggest.
		So that left duct tape.
		I was really reluctant to use duct tape on my genitals, but eventually, I gave up and caved.
		It turned out to work really well, though it did have its problems.
		If I didn&apos;t have time to put it on carefully, it&apos;d cause chaffing.
		Furthermore, if I sweat too much, it&apos;d come off and I&apos;d start getting an embarrassing bulge in my tight pants, unless I&apos;d predicted it&apos;d be a sweaty day and had practically built myself a thong out of duct tape.
		On top of that, I hated the daily plastic waste, and wished there was some sort of biodegradable cloth tape I could use instead.
		But surely even if that existed, it wouldn&apos;t have the strength of duct tape and wouldn&apos;t hold everything inside.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I ran across different tucking instructions.
		I&apos;m not even sure why I ended up on this page, as I already know how to tuck.
		However I got there though, this page said to use athletic tape and never duct tape.
		I was sceptical, but figured I&apos;d give it a try, so I bought some.
		Today, I got a chance to try it out.
		Wow, this stuff is <strong>*so*</strong> much more comfortable.
		If applied correctly, I can&apos;t even feel the duct tape.
		The athletic tape feels cleaner than being bare though.
		The athletic tape feels very insecure when applied, and it seems like it&apos;ll start to come off in a few minutes.
		It feels like it&apos;s already starting to come off a little right when you put it on, actually.
		It seems to stick better after a bit though, and holds all day.
		Athletic tape is made from cloth too, probably cotton, which is exactly what I&apos;d wanted previously.
		Being cloth, and not plastic, it breathes better, so I hoped I&apos;d be less likely to sweat it off.
		I mean, the sweat should dry instead of building up, right?
		I still feared I&apos;d sweat too much though.
		That fear was entirely misplaced.
		It&apos;s <strong>*athletic*</strong> tape; it&apos;s <strong>*designed*</strong> for physical activity, and should be able to handle far more sweat than I&apos;d throw at it.
		And sure enough, it held all day even better than the duct tape does.
		Athletic tape is definitely a better option than duct tape.

<section id="blades">
	<h2>Replacement blades</h2>
	<p>
		The replacement blades for the pizza dress machine arrived today.
		How long has that been, a week?
		Yeah, it had to be a week.
		Last Tuesday, I was struggling against not only the pizza dress machine mangling the pepperoni, but also my shift leader partner not showing up.
		They only play hooky on Tuesdays, and if they played hooky on a different day, I&apos;d&apos;ve found that odd and specifically remembered it being a non-Tuesday.
		Why do we not keep replacement blades on-hand?
		Anyway, two sets came in today, so we have a set for next time, but my guess is that when we use the next set, we won&apos;t get more ordered right away like we should.
		If only I were in charge of the orders.
		No, scratch that.
		I&apos;m stressed out enough as it is without having me be the one figuring out what we need shipped in each week.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I was totally done with the machine&apos;s nonsense, and figured I&apos;m high enough ranking to authorise myself to deal with the blade change, especially as it&apos;s something that every manager in the store is aware by now knows needs to happen as soon as possible.
		It felt odd not checking with my superiors first, but what can you do?
		I&apos;ve never done this before though, so I checked the manual to try to get instructions for it.
		Oddly enough, no instructions for blade-changing were in the manual.
		However, instructions for changing out the motors are in the manual, and the first several steps were to remove the blades, so I just followed the beginning of those instructions, then followed them in reverse to put the new blades in.
		It seems odd that there&apos;s no blade-changing instructions though.
		Also, it&apos;d be nice if there were pictures of the tools.
		For example, the instructions said to use the &quot;blade guards&quot; and the &quot;blade-removal wrench&quot;.
		It was easy enough to find the blade-removal wrench as it was the wrench that was the perfect size for the bolt, but what does a blade guard look like?
		There was another tool name I was confused by too, and I didn&apos;t even figure out what that one was even in the end, though I ended up not needing it because the part of the instructions involving the blades stopped just short of my needing that tool.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve decided that I rally want <code>neodrops</code> to be very clean and minimalistic.
		The less stuff it adds to the game while still doing its job perfectly, the better.
		I think I&apos;m going to redraw the textures too, to look more like Minimal&apos;s textures.
		That is, when I don&apos;t outright <strong>*reuse*</strong> Minimal&apos;s textures.
		For example, I think I want all leaf types to look identical.
		The saplings should look slightly different for ease of spotting, but should be redrawn in the 0.3.* style that Minimal uses instead of the more-modern style.
		Likewise, I think I want the human-readable drop item names to end in ellipses and question marks and reflect the fact that these items are strange and unrecognised.
		For example, the jungle sapling might be called &quot;Tall Sapling ...?&quot;, the pine sapling might be called &quot;Pointy Sapling ...?&quot;, and the mese crystal might be called &quot;Odd Crystal ...?&quot; or, as we don&apos;t yet know what crystals are, &quot;Odd Stone ...?&quot;.
		Quite simply, they come from a future time when we players have begun to differentiate things better.
		It&apos;s not that there was only one type of tree and now there are magically five types of tree.
		No.
		It&apos;s more that we now pay attention enough to notice that not all trees are the same.
		Silver sand didn&apos;t suddenly show up out of nowhere either, we just mistook it for beach sand because we didn&apos;t know any better.
		There are still things we don&apos;t differentiate that we might in the future.
		For example, wood that comes from generic bushes is incorrectly labelled as &quot;Apple Wood&quot; and stacks with wood that came from actual apple trees.
		Clearly, these aren&apos;t the same item, but we stack them together and call them the same thing out of convenience and because we don&apos;t see enough of a difference to bother doing otherwise.
		We&apos;re not advanced enough of builders to see the finer differences and want to use these differences to our advantage in our builds.
