		I&apos;m really starting to appreciate my decision not to mine the ice sheet ice and stick only with the glacier ice.
		The sheer amount of ice I have to move is immense, but if I&apos;d started on the ice sheet ice too, I&apos;d have to finish that as well just to make the place look okay.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, as I clear out all this ice, it&apos;s obviously forming an overhang above.
		It certainly doesn&apos;t look all that natural.
		I think the best way to make the place look better might be to build a facility of some sort down beneath and make the snow and ice into a ceiling.
		The area exposed to the sky would be like an open space surrounded by a circular building.
		I&apos;m not sure what sort of facility I should build though, especially given how immense the size of this place is.
		For what would I need a facility this large for?
		If I hadn&apos;t already build the cold storage facility, this would be a hilarious place to put it.
		One of the difficult parts of figuring out what sort of facility to put here is the sloping ceiling.
		For example, I thought a laboratory might be a good idea, but I can&apos;t for the life of me come up with a good excuse as to why a respectable laboratory&apos;s ceiling would slope all the way down to the ground.
		There&apos;s not a whole lot of space between the ceiling and the floor even in the high spots.
		Assuming I install a floor - as bare stone and cobble seems like a bad idea - and don&apos;t install a ceiling - showing the slope of the snow above - I&apos;d have a five-metre space between the bottom and the top.
		It sounds like a fair bit of space, but then you realise it not only means that you quickly lose space as the ceiling slopes downward, but also means you can&apos;t have multiple floors or extra-tall rooms.
		For example, in a lab, I might want to put trees in a couple of the rooms and study tree growth.
		Can&apos;t do that here though.
		Not enough space.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe this could be some sort of villainous lair, or a mad science lab.
		Sure, it&apos;s not very fit for a <strong>*respectable*</strong> lab, but the lab of some lunatic?
		It might work well.
