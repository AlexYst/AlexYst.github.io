		I kept encountering graphical errors today.
		It was like the textures of the nodes would bend and curve away from where they should be at times, forming visual cracks in the ground.
		I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s causing the issue, but as far as I can tell, it&apos;s only cosmetic.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was working on the bridge, I found a chest I&apos;d left over near the iceberg containing cobble and silver sand.
		I think when I halted work there, I took what I could carry and left what I couldn&apos;t.
		I&apos;ve brought that stuff back to base though now, and I&apos;ve now got over a chest of cobble on hand, so it should be safe to get back to working on the island.
		I still want to get more work done elsewhere first though, and I still might go on another mining trip anyway for more silver sand.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started working on the new mod for displaying level information from <code>liblevelup</code>, which I forked from some unreleased code I already had on hand.
		I quickly had to give up for the day though.
		I knew exactly what I wanted it to look like, but I hadn&apos;t answered the two biggest questions of all.
		First, do I hard-code it to work with the 31 drops from Minetest Games past and present, or do I make it dynamically adjust to work with whatever drops <code>liblevelup</code> detects?
		Hard-coding would be easier.
		Furthermore, it&apos;d allow me to add drop-specific features, such as flavour text and improved resource-hunting advice.
		However, making it dynamic would be more in the spirit of <code>liblevelup</code>.
		Secondly, if I go with the dynamic option - which I know to be the correct option, even if I talk myself out of it - how do I want to handle the unknown length of the drop list?
		By the time it was time to head in to work, I&apos;d answered both questions, but it did take a while.
		I&apos;ll probably begin work on the mod again tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		Work was rather slow today.
		So while I did what little there was to get done, I thought about ideas for the exact layout I&apos;ll use for the drop-specific part of the inventory page.
		After a bit, I started thinking again about the clickable list of drops.
		I&apos;d previously planned to have drops that a player hadn&apos;t found yet display as question marks and no specific information be available about them.
		One problem was metadata that&apos;d be available though.
		Previously, the question marks were going to be coloured like the drops, but I scrapped that idea the other day because it would hint at what drops you were missing.
		One problem persisted though.
		Or rather, two.
		First, it shows that there are elements left to find.
		But also, because the elements are displayed in alphabetical order, it also hints at what might be missing.
		Today though, I decided to make the list size player-dependant, not world-dependant.
		That fixes all the problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was writing about the clickable list, I realised I could use an actual clickable, scrolling list instead of the field of buttons I planned, but after thinking about it a while, I realised that the field of buttons will work better.
		There&apos;s still no way to include images in a scrolling list, let alone &quot;item images&quot;, which allow counts and tool wear to be displayed.
		I plan to use both, with counts used to display level and tool wear used to display progress toward the next level.
		Of course, both can&apos;t be used on the same item due to the engine normalising item stacks, disallowing tool wear on non-tools, and disallowing the stacking of tools.
		However, I&apos;ll define an invisible tool item to overlay on the stackable items, and it&apos;ll be fine.
		The only notable issue is that at level zero, no item is displayed at all, and at level one, no item count is displayed.
		I built a workaround before, but have opted not to use it.
		I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s a feature or a bug, but it&apos;s staying at least for now.
