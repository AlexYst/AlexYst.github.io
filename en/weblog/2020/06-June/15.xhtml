<section id="pump">
	<h2>Tire pump</h2>
	<p>
		I figured I&apos;d take a walk to the nearby bike store today to pick up a bike pump if they were open.
		If they weren&apos;t, I&apos;d get one from the local department store later, even though the pumps there are made by a company that produces shoddy products.
		It&apos;d just have to do.
		I wasn&apos;t walking all the way to the distant bike store just in case they were maybe open.
		If the pandemic wasn&apos;t going on, I&apos;d&apos;ve gone to the distant bike store first, knowing they&apos;d have what I need.
		For some reason, I like the distant bike store better than the one that&apos;s only a few blocks from me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got to the bike store, and found it closed to walk-in customers and providing service and sales by appointment only.
		That would have been fine, I could have come back later after making an appointment, but the sign said they only make appointments via telephone.
		That pissed me off.
		I got so frustrated that I decided to head to the other bike store.
		If I&apos;d known I was going there, I would have tried my best to pump up my tire with the less-broken of my pumps then biked there.
		Instead, I ended up taking a two-hour walk, round trip.
		I&apos;m probably never shopping at the nearby bike store again.
		That&apos;s how frustrated their we-won&apos;t-sell-to-you-right-now-without-a-telephone-call attitude made me.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other bike store was open.
		At first, all I could find there was expensive, fancy-looking bike pumps.
		I kept looking though, and found some tiny, affordable pumps.
		Between the shock of the initial prices I&apos;d seen and my frustration with the other bike store, I forgot to check for what I needed and just got the least-expensive pump.
		It came with a clip to attach it to one&apos;s bike, which seems like a really bad idea to me.
		It&apos;s similar to the clips for attaching a bike lock, but there&apos;s a huge difference when it comes to locks.
		With the lock, you unclip the lock and lock your bike up.
		The clip isn&apos;t in use except during travel and at home.
		With the pump though, your pump is going to get stolen.
		The other main thing about this pump though is that it&apos;s purse-sized, so I can easily take it with me all the time for unexpected flats.
		Once I got it home to my bike though, I immediately noticed that it doesn&apos;t have a pressure gauge.
		I&apos;d intended not to buy one without a gauge, as I&apos;m bad at judging when the tire&apos;s where it should be in terms of firmness.
		I&apos;ve been known to overfill and cause ruptures or deliberately underfill in an effort not to overfill and cause ruptures.
		So this isn&apos;t going to cut it.
		I&apos;m going to need to go get another.
		It&apos;ll get me through the day, but I think the slightly more expensive pump had a pressure gauge and was still affordable.
		Or I guess I should actually just make do with what I&apos;ve got after all.
		I don&apos;t really have the funds to blow, seeing as I&apos;ve lent most of my spending money to Freya.
		I&apos;m down to my last hundred and fifty dollars, and my next <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> appointment&apos;s going to cost me one hundred of that.
		It could be a while before I have more spending money, too.
		I usually set aside my entire pay cheque, using it only for rent, tuition, and savings.
		I might need to start dipping into my savings a bit just to pay for food and electricity.

<section id="bushes">
	<h2>Bushes</h2>
	<p>
		On the way home, I found a row of pine bushes between the sidewalk and the road, complete with decent-sized cones.
		That surprised me.
		I&apos;ve worked with pine bushes in Minetest, but I honestly thought that the Minetesters had made those up for the game.
		I thought acacia bushes might be made-up too.
		Pine bushes are actually a real thing.
		I looked up acacia bushes when I got home, and those are real too.
		Interesting.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="break">
	<h2>Break between terms</h2>
	<p>
		This has, by far, been my least-restful, least-productive break between terms to date.
		I&apos;ve gotten next to nothing done, and I feel even more run down than that break in which I overexerted myself to the point of spending too much energy to keep my immune system running well and making myself sick.
		I&apos;ve been trying to stay indoors and away from the plague instead of getting things done, while at the same time, many places have been closed or limiting business so I couldn&apos;t get much done even if I wanted to.
		I should have gotten more cleaning done at home.
		I really should have.
		But I haven&apos;t really had the energy for it between still being run-down by the school&apos;s garbage and being stuck inside all the time.
		This has really sucked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, I have my Tuesday errands as well as the week&apos;s laundry to wash.
		The next day, school begins again.
		Ugh.
		I should try to get my inner tubes patched tomorrow while I&apos;m doing laundry, but I&apos;ll likely put that off.
		At best, I&apos;ll probably get them patched the next day before school, though even doing that seems unlikely given my lack of motivation for anything lately.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_3.0/minetest.net./weblog/2020/06/15.png" alt="My failed attempt at building bars" class="framed-centred-image" width="1024" height="600"/>

	<p>
		I thought I could build bars out of stone and wood by alternating columns of wooden fences and stone walls.
		The idea was that because these nodes weren&apos;t programmed to connect to one another, they wouldn&apos;t, and would act like standalone columns.
		As it turns out, that doesn&apos;t work.
		They <strong>*are*</strong> programmed to connect.
		Drats.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the bars were a bust, I did manage to finish my work in the river around the pinewood pagoda.
		I&apos;m done laying silver sand there, and can go back to laying it along the southern edge of the generated world.
