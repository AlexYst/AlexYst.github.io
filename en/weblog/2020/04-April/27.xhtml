	<h2>Freya</h2>
	<p>
		Before work, Freya wrote, asking to borrow another $150 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		Sucker that I am, I agreed.
		That brings the total up to $1600.
		We ended up meeting after work, 
	</p>
	<p>
		She also recommended me another fast food job; one that&apos;s better than where I am.
		It wouldn&apos;t take much to be better.
		Still, I hope to get out of fast food.
		Once I fix my voice, I want to find a non-food-service job.
		I&apos;ve told her before that I want to get out of food service, and though I said it again today, she still seemed to think this job was a good idea.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we met, she pointed out that it looked like I have breasts now, even if small ones.
		So I explained how I have several bra pads to create the illusion.
		We started talking about the hassles of bra wires, which I&apos;ve never dealt with because I don&apos;t need the support.
		They don&apos;t sound fun.
		She&apos;d brought her girlfriend, who didn&apos;t seem to understand the padding situation, so we both tried explaining how the pads come out of bras and the mechanics of how I&apos;d taken the pads from several bras and put them into one bra.
		I mentioned that I thought the holes the pads can be taken in and out of were probably to allow for better washing.
		I honestly wasn&apos;t sure what other purpose they&apos;d have.
		Freya was convinced they&apos;re for replacing the bra pads.
		So I asked how you&apos;d even get more bra pads to replace the old ones.
		It was more rhetoric than anything, as I thought you&apos;d need to buy new bras to get new pads.
		I was wrong though.
		Very wrong.
		I should have trusted that someone who&apos;s been wearing bras most of their life would know about their maintenance better than I would.
		I guess that was slightly arrogant, on my part.
		But anyway, they said that you can find replacement bra pads at craft stores.
		Awesome!
		I&apos;ve been using the same bra every day because I don&apos;t want to buy a bunch more bras that&apos;ll only be stripped of their pads and left to rot.
		Now I can get pads and make those bras usable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Freya&apos;s girlfriend told me something interesting.
		According to her, there&apos;s a new medical procedure for converting sperm into eggs and building transwomen their own wombs.
		These transwomen are then able to get pregnant just like ciswomen.
		Intriguing.
		Of course, I want no part of that.
		To create more humans would be the most vile and despicable thing I could possibly do.
		And without a desire to commit such evil, I don&apos;t need any sperm converted into eggs.
		I tried to verify her information online when I got home though, and there&apos;s no trace of it that I could find.
		So take this report with a grain of salt.
	</p>
	<p>
		Freya&apos;s girlfriend is more aggressive and hostile than I&apos;d realised, though given her past, I guess it&apos;s to be expected.
		Still, she&apos;s a bit scary.
		Though I do try to be polite to everyone, I should still take extra care not to piss her off or offend her.
		Speaking of which, she says she wants to meet again and go do something, though she doesn&apos;t know what.
		Though I&apos;m not exactly sure how safe she is, I&apos;m somehow not against the idea.
		So that might be happening at some point.
		I might recommend mini golf, not because i have any interest in it whatsoever, but because I don&apos;t know what else to do that we&apos;d both likely be interested in and Freya mentioned wanting to go mini golfing.
		It could be a start, anyway.

	<h2>Pandemic precautions</h2>
	<p>
		One of the other shift leaders brought my attention to a new package that had arrived.
		It contained sneeze guards to put in front of the front registers!
		They weren&apos;t sure if they should open the box.
		I wasn&apos;t either, but said I&apos;d take the blame and opened it anyway.
		The chances of trouble were slim, anyway.
		I then proceeded to install them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hadn&apos;t thought about washing my hands first though.
		I&apos;d been working the pizza dress station, so my hands were all covered in meat grease.
		I left hand prints on several of the edges.
		That was unsanitary, but more than that, I was worried customers would see the prints and think the place unsanitary in the wrong way.
		They might not feel safe from the corona virus, even though the virus had nothing to do with the hand prints.
		So I set about cleaning off the prints.
		It took longer than I wanted it to, so a workmate saw me messing with the shields for an extended period of time.
		They said that we should start calling me &quot;Plexi Lexi&quot;.
		Ha ha.
		Nice.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I finished enough of the level-based achievements code for my own purposes.
		The code that&apos;s not finished is some stuff for better integration with the Awards mod.
		It has a setting that swaps out the graphical notifications for text-based ones.
		If I&apos;m going to release what I&apos;ve done, I should make my mod imitate the text-based notifications when the Awards mod is configured to use those instead of having it impose the graphical notifications and make itself stand out like a sore thumb.
		In addition to that, I&apos;d like to get some graphics drawn for the achievements, but I&apos;m not sure what to draw yet.
		For now, I&apos;m using the item textures as placeholders.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started tearing up the dirt at <code>y</code> elevation zero to replace it with silver sand.
		I think I&apos;m going to line the ocean and the beaches with the stuff, build things that are meant to stick out of the water, and set aside the flooded city idea for now.
		I don&apos;t have nearly enough silver sand for that at the moment, but to help plan, I&apos;m putting silver sand instead of dirt with coniferous litter at specifically elevation zero.
		That&apos;s the highest elevation that sits underneath the water, so it&apos;ll let me see where the water will be, especially on the map.
		I started in the village though, which won&apos;t really be a village now, as it&apos;s close to where all my supplies are.
		I&apos;ve been using silver sand to mark the boxes around the dungeons though.
		I was going to swap to the lines for dirt lines where appropriate, but some of the lines cross the water level threshold, and I didn&apos;t want to worry about the ambiguity caused in some places.
		It&apos;d defeat the purpose of the outlines to begin with.
		So I went to the storehouse to see if I could find anything I could use for the box outlines instead.
		I found straw, which is perfect, because if I run out, I can grow more.
		And there&apos;s not much, so I did run out.
		Having even that little amount of straw though is great because it sparked the idea of using straw.
		But also, I&apos;m unlikely to embed straw in the ground in the finished area, so I won&apos;t likely need to swap out the lines again.
		But do you know what else I found?
		Over a chest full of pine logs!
		I thought I&apos;d use all my pine logs, so I didn&apos;t even check the storehouse.
		I don&apos;t need to worry about cutting any more trees for a while.
		I think I&apos;ll be able to finish the lower skeleton of the bridge, though I probably won&apos;t be able to finish the bridge entirely without more logs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found a game-crashing bug.
		It seems that Minetest chains registered on-craft callbacks, passing the output of one as input to the next.
		It doesn&apos;t convert the output into an <code>ItemStack()</code> before passing it to the next, but when only one on-craft callback is in effect, it happily accepts other item-representation formats as output.
		<code>mushroom_tools</code> has been passing item strings, for example.
		But the Awards mod assumes that its input is in <code>ItemStack()</code> format and tries to call <code>ItemStack():is_empty()</code> on it without first converting it to an <code>ItemStack()</code>.
		By whatever arbitrary criterion is used to determine the order the callbacks are called, <code>mushroom_tools</code> gets to go first, and then Awards&apos; callback takes its output as input.
		And that crashed the game whenever I tried to craft mushroom lumps, which I did to consolidate the mushrooms I&apos;d cleared from some of the planting beds to make room for wheat.
		I wasn&apos;t sure where the bug was.
		I mean, I tracked down exactly what the problem, but which of the three scripts was the one behaving incorrectly?
		It was quickest and easiest to fix the issue from my own code, so I did that, but as I did so, I also considered submitting pull requests to the other two code bases as well.
		It might as well be fixed in all three spots.
		When I finished testing my fixed code though, I took a look in the Minetest documentation to see what it said.
		I expected it to explicitly say that any of the three item-representation formats could be used as output, as it does say that in quite a few places where item information needs to be used.
		To my surprise though, it instead says that on-craft callbacks should return an <code>ItemStack()</code> or <code>nil</code>.
		Well that decides that.
		The documentation explicitly says that the bug was in my own code.
		No pull requests necessary then.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess my main goals for now are to come up with a texture for the achievements, come up with a design for a seed-/sapling-storage vault, and build out the northern bridge.
		Actually, now that I think on it, it&apos;d be nice to stop laying down dirt that I&apos;m only going to be replacing with silver sand later.
		I should mine for silver sand, which means setting up the mine.
		I&apos;m going to be getting loads of cobblestone out of there, so I&apos;ll need a place to stash that for the time being.
		I need a dump-off station near the mine&apos;s entrance.
		I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be ready to build that until the road system is more complete though.
		I want it out in the water, probably in the form of a castle-looking tower or something.
		For now, I will probably just dump off the cobble in a temporary cluster of chests on the bridge.
		I don&apos;t really like these temporary storage solutions, but I bit off <strong>*way*</strong> more than I could chew with this World&apos;s Navel sector-wide renovation project.
		Lesson learned, I guess, but for now, my storage is just going to have to take the form of chest clusters for a bit longer.
		And I can&apos;t start the mine until I decide how and where to build the entrance, which means first figuring out what the path will look like over there so I can make the entrance in the correct place.
		So that means my main goals are to figure out the design of the path over in the east; where the mine will be, figure out a mine entrance; which will likely just be a simple gap lined with stone blocks, and come up with a texture for the achievements.
