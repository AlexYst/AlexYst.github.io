	<h2>Pandemic precautions</h2>
	<p>
		I found an announcement from corporate on the counter today.
		They&apos;ve added seventy washable face masks to our shipment order.
		We have twenty employees.
		Hopefully, that means we&apos;ll be given three each.
		According to the instructions, we&apos;re supposed to wash them after every use, but working five days per week, that can&apos;t happen unless we get five each.
		Still, it&apos;d be nice to have a fresh mask every other day and wash them with my laundry every week.

	<h2>Idiot</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m always astounded by the idiocy of some customers.
		I had one call in and try to place a delivery order today, so as always, I explained that we only accept delivery orders via the website and cannot deliver orders placed over the telephone.
		&quot;I&apos;m not a computer person.&quot;, they replied.
		So I apologised and once again made it clear that I cannot take delivery orders over the telephone.
		&quot;How much time do you have?&quot;, they asked.
		I replied that I wasn&apos;t sure what they meant.
		It didn&apos;t help that they were mumbling everything they said, so I was having to ask them to repeat quite a bit.
		It seemed like they still wanted to place an order though, so I asked them if that was the case.
		&quot;And you&apos;re going to bring it to me?&quot;
		No.
		We can&apos;t deliver telephone based orders.
		Again, they told me that they&apos;re not a computer person.
		So again, I apologised that we can&apos;t take delivery orders via telephone, and again, they asked me how much time I had.
		I&apos;m not quite sure what they were getting at.
		Again, they asked me if I&apos;d bring them their order.
		No.
		No, we can&apos;t do that unless you place your order on the Web.
		They hung up without another word.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a bit, I started to feel a little bad, thinking that I was doing the same thing as the Discover representatives, refusing to help over the telephone, but in reverse.
		But then I remembered.
		That&apos;s not what the Discover representatives were doing to tick me off.
		I accepted that they weren&apos;t going to help me without a telephone call.
		I wasn&apos;t asking them to help me without a telephone call anyway.
		I was asking them to give me a straight answer.
		I was asking them to stop claiming that I wasn&apos;t out of luck without a way to telephone them.
		With this person, I told them straight-up that without placing the order on the web, we cannot deliver it for them.
		While I can&apos;t control this policy, I can be honest about it, and that&apos;s what I owe the customers.
		That said, the only thing I don&apos;t agree with this this policy is that we&apos;re still taking orders over the telephone at all.
		I&apos;d push the policy and the Web-based ordering even more than corporate is.
		The fact that I don&apos;t control the policy doesn&apos;t mean that I disagree with it, only that I can&apos;t be held responsible for it.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I came up with three or four different designs for blending the road with the terrain.
		The final design was to just cut through the stone, then line the walls with logs, as if the logs were holding back the dirt and stone, keeping the road clear.
		I figured that wouldn&apos;t look <strong>*too*</strong> awful.
		I was nervous to dig into the stone here, but I built the main wooden road structure, preparing to reassess and plan the log-based retaining walls.
		I think the main thing I felt I needed to do was just get some sort of road structure in place so I&apos;d&apos;ve started.
		Starting is the hardest part for me, much of the time.
		What I had seemed fine already though.
		I don&apos;t think I need retaining walls.
		I&apos;ll just leave the stone exposed.
		I might add ladders to get out, but I plan to add ladders on the supports for the bridge, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t think this setup works well for a mine though.
		I need to branch the road and have the fork lead to the mine, but I don&apos;t want to dig into either of these walls.
		I don&apos;t think it&apos;d look good.
		I might need to put the mine in the water.
		Perhaps the storage tower I mentioned could hold the entrance to the mine, so I pass through it on my way out and can drop off my load.
