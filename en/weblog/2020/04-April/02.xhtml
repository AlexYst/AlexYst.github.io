		As expected, the school&apos;s pulling their garbage again and has deregistered me from my courses in the coming term because the pandemic has slowed the mail down enough that my tuition payment didn&apos;t make it to them as early as they wanted it to.
		And just as a quick reminder, I offered to start paying in advance, but they refuse to accept advance payments, so I can&apos;t pay early.
		I have to wait until they request the payment, and if the mail&apos;s not fast enough, there&apos;s nothing I can do about it.
		Their rules, not mine.

		I got most of the crafting logic complete and chose levels for unlocking the first six alchemic crafts.
		The one part of the crafting logic I didn&apos;t get done was the handling of sand as an alchemic ingredient.
		It gets ... special treatment, to say the least.
		Instead of using up actual sand, it takes from a sand counter that increases when you mine sand.
		I don&apos;t have the code to deduct from that counter set up yet though, and while it would be easy to write, I just wasn&apos;t feeling it today.

		I thing I want to rework the recipe table structure though.
		It&apos;s okay as it is, but once I add more elements and it gets bigger, I&apos;m going to want something more organised.
		Well, not more organised per se, but easier to read the organisation of when looking at the code.
