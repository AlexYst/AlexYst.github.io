		I&apos;ve been wanting taco pizza today and yesterday.
		I need to go get ingredients though.
		I thought about heading out for what I needed today before work, but opted not to.
		With the pandemic going on, it&apos;s better to stay inside until I need to go out.
		I was feeling rather restless today too, so I wasn&apos;t really up for getting much done at home, and would really have liked to go out.
		I&apos;ll pick up what I need on Wednesday and Thursday.
		Then I&apos;ll be at work with the pizza ovens on Friday.
		I can wait a week for taco pizza.
		It&apos;d be nice to have something more interesting to do at home though.

		At work, yet another person telephoned in about a delivery order.
		Once more, I told them that all delivery orders need to be placed through the website.
		Technically, delivery orders can also be placed through the mobile application, but of course, I never mention that because the mobile application is creepy.
		This customer customer seemed to know about the mobile application though, and asked whether I recommended the mobile application or the website.
		I enthusiastically recommended the website, of course.
		That said, I don&apos;t honestly stand behind either.
		It seems corporate has gotten into their stupid little heads that <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> is the enemy, so they&apos;re now maliciously discriminating against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users.
	</p>
	<p>
		All day, the pizza-dressing machine has been throwing tantrums and refusing to sauce the pizzas.
		That&apos;s been rather aggravating.
		I then have to fix the hose for the umpteenth time, and undress the last four pizzas the machine failed to dress properly as I cycle them out and back in to be redressed.
		I swear, the technology around here doesn&apos;t work great.
		Some of it can be attributed to the fact that our system is running on Windows, but the pizza-dresser doesn&apos;t even run Windows, nor would Windows be able to control the hose if it did.
		The software the thing does run fails to function in a variety of ways though, so it&apos;s more than just hardware problems that it has.

		I&apos;m still having trouble coming up with names for the sapling-based hybrids.
		I might end up going with the on-the-nose names of coalwood saplings, ironwood saplings, and sandwood saplings.
		They aren&apos;t eh most creative names, but they do have a nice advantage in that they&apos;d allow me to get started sooner, as I wouldn&apos;t still be stuck coming up with names like I am now.
