	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was waiting in this building for someone to do something.
		I forget exactly who I was waiting for or why.
		While I waited though, I kept myself entertained with this huge machine.
		It had three functions.
		It accepted bottles for deposit, it sold ice cream, and ... I don&apos;t quite remember the third function, but I think it might have been a completely-automated pizza-maker.
		To switch between functions, the entire inside of the machine would move up or down, bringing the parts newly to be in use into view in the huge window in the front.
		I was returning bottles, and decided I wanted a cold treat while I did so.
		There was one vegan option, a sort of fruity ice pop, so I switched the machine over to ice cream vending.
		I think I left a bottle in the machine though without pressing the button to get the machine to take it.
		Bottles weren&apos;t automatically taken, unlike the real-world bottle-return machines.
		When I switched the machine over, that flimsy plastic bottle somehow jammed the machine enough that its huge, metal components ended up coming apart and it seemed like the machine was doing enough damage to its surroundings that the whole building was going to come down.

		My goal for the day was to get some work put in on the code of <code>alchemy2</code> that isn&apos;t element-specific, such as the crafting system and recipe page of the menu.
		I really wanted to get some of the elemental stuff planned early though.
		In particular, each element will have an elemental symbol, similar chemical symbols of the periodic table.
		Each symbol will be one character long and used in some of the item and node names for any item that&apos;s dropped or node that does the dropping.
		I&apos;ve been planning elemental symbols for ages.
		I figured I&apos;d sit down and figure out which element gets which character before getting started on the actual code of the other stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		At first, I figured I&apos;d start with the original four elements, assign them letters, then add each new set of elements and assign them remaining characters from the set of 63 characters allowed in Minetest item names.
		That&apos;s what I&apos;d always planned.
		Coal would be &quot;c&quot;, iron would be &quot;i&quot;, sand would be &quot;n&quot;, and saplings would be &quot;p&quot;.
		After a few rounds of assigning letters with the chosen letters being further and further from the start of the items&apos; names due to letters already being taken, I decided that because the palette system is such an integral part of this new version of <code>alchemy2</code>, I could probably safely start with the known elements from when palettes were first introduced.
		I might be able to make things more sane, for example by assigning &quot;p&quot; to pine saplings instead of apple saplings.
		So I took a look at the list.
		Much to my amusement, there are exactly 26 elements that were known at that time.
		I could assign all the lower-case letters to them, or if I wanted, the upper-case ones.
		Sure, some element would be bizarrely handed the &quot;z&quot; designation, for example, but it&apos;d kind of group these elements as the originals in a manner of speaking.
		I liked the idea.
		Elements added later could be assigned upper-case letters, digits, and the underscore if I get desperate enough for characters.
		After that, the system would need to be reworked a bit to allow two-character symbols in addition to the one-character ones, but the one-character ones would need to remain in place to avoid resetting stats gained by players who&apos;d harvested descendants of their hybrids.
		My letter-assigning decisions are as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			a: <code>default:acacia_sapling</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			b: <code>default:bush_sapling</code>
		</li>
		<li>

		</li>

		<li>

		</li>
		<li>
			i: <code>default:iron_lump</code>
		</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			m: <code>default:mese_crystal</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			n: <code>default:sand</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			o: <code>farming:seed_cotton</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			p: <code>default:pine_sapling</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			q: <code>farming:string</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			r: <code>default:copper_lump</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			s: <code>default:sapling</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			t: <code>default:tin_lump</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			u: <code>default:acacia_bush_sapling</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			v: <code>flowers:mushroom_brown</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			w: <code>farming:wheat</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			x: <code>flowers:mushroom_red</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			y: <code>flowers:mushroom_spores_brown</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			z: <code>flowers:mushroom_spores_red</code>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I got a fair amount done on the crafting logic, though at one point, I couldn&apos;t figure out how I wanted my craft result data structure to work.
		I got discouraged and didn&apos;t get anything done for several hours.
		I finally forced myself to go back to it, and I got the hard part out of the way.
		I&apos;d wasted too much time though, and ended up not finishing the crafting logic as I&apos;d planned.
		Setting up the alchemic symbols first was definitely the right move though.
		I ended up weaving that symbol list into the crafting logic, so it was good not to have to put a dummy table in place in the mean time.
