		Last week, he head manager didn&apos;t show up on the schedule for this week, even though April was beginning.
		I mostly lost hope for them returning, but it was still possible the schedule would be amended when they got back.
		But now, the head manager was supposedly going to be back two days ago, and there&apos;s still no sign of them.
		The new schedule for the coming week doesn&apos;t mention them either.
		At this point, I&apos;m pretty sure they&apos;re not coming back.
		We&apos;re no longer trying to get through until they return, but instead just trying to get through as long as we can.
		Things have been going better than they originally had though.
		I can keep going hopefully long enough for vocal therapy.
		I talked to the night assistant manager about it, pointing out that I guess the head manager isn&apos;t coming back.
		They claimed that their return date has just been postponed.
		Again.
		Supposedly, they&apos;re coming back on April 16 this time.
		We&apos;ll see.
		I&apos;m not holding my breath this time though.
		I have to assume we&apos;ve got to keep things together without them.
	</p>
	<p>
		A customer asked me today if we were on &quot;panic hours&quot;.
		I found that amusing.
		I hadn&apos;t heard them referred to as that before.
		We also now have pizza box seals that show whether a pizza box has been opened post-sale.
		The landing crew doesn&apos;t seem to be using them yet, but it&apos;s an interesting development.
	</p>
	<p>
		We&apos;ve now been give those &quot;work visas&quot; as well.
		Mostly, they&apos;re just letters claiming us to be employees of the restaurant; claiming that as employees of an establishment deemed to be &quot;critical infrastructure&quot;, we&apos;re exempt from travel restriction and curfew laws, and telling anyone that reads it to telephone the supervisor if they have questions.
		So the laws are real, and we weren&apos;t properly notified of them.
		Lovely.
		the <strong>*only*</strong> word I&apos;ve heard about this has been through mere <strong>*rumour*</strong>, and I wasn&apos;t even sure if it was true or not.
		There really should have been an effort made to make sure people knew what is going on.

	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		As I was headed to bed, minutes before midnight, a new email arrived.
		The school now acknowledges my payment, the day after they deregistered me for courses.
		I tried to get reregistered, but this delay caused by the school has once again caused me to be unable to take <span title="Information Retrieval">CS 3308</span>.
		This is the second term in a row.
		If they do it a third time, I&apos;ll&apos;ve run out of required courses to take and have to wait to take this <strong>*required*</strong> course after taking electives.
		This is ridiculous.
		Anyway, <span title="Information Retrieval">CS 3308</span> is now the final required course I&apos;ll be taking.

		I reworked the alchemic recipe data structure and modified the crafting code to properly account for the change.
		I think this&apos;ll work out better in the long run.
		I&apos;ve also gotten sand credits implemented.
		Theses&apos;ll basically be a replacement for void sand.
		Instead of void sand showing up and being usable in alchemic recipes, sand will simply not be consumed by alchemic recipes, and such recipes will cost credits earned by destroying sand through sandstone-digging.
		It&apos;s less than ideal, but I&apos;m not sure how to determine the colour of void sand when it&apos;s given to the player, so I can&apos;t really give players physical void sand for the time being.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve also decided not to use alchemic symbols in item identifiers, instead just using their names.
		I think people who read the code might find the symbol-based identifiers strange.
		The flip side of this though is that after I&apos;ve completed each round of development, I&apos;ll no longer be allowed to change these items out for others.
		I&apos;m stuck with them.
	</p>
	<p>
		The old names for the coal/sand and iron/sand hybrids - duplicoal and dupliron - don&apos;t really fit how these items work any more.
		I&apos;m going to need to come up with new names, in addition to the new designs I already mentioned needing.
		So I thought that&apos;d be my goal for the day: coming up with those names and designs.
		There&apos;s not much left I can program until I have them, though I do still have a couple auxiliary features I wouldn&apos;t mind the mod having.
		I might include those in later versions though, and not the initial milestone 0 release.
		I ended up instead working just with names and ideas, not any textures, but did go beyond just those two.
	</p>
	<p>
		To start with, I tried to research what coal and sand might produce together.
		Minetest sand can be cooked into glass, so I have to assume that it&apos;s rich in silicon.
		Coal, on the other hand, is primarily carbon.
		I figured what I needed to do was find the material made by chemically binding silica and carbon.
		This wasn&apos;t as easy as it sounded.
		Most search results were less than helpful, and I had to chase down numerous dead-end leads.
		Does silica not bind with carbon?
		Finally, I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide">silicon carbide or carborundum</a> (SiC), the chemical made by binding silicon and carbon.
		Seriously, why did this not come up pretty early on in my searching?
		Anyway, outside of chemistry, it seems to be more commonly known as the rock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite">moissanite</a>.
		So that&apos;ll be my coal/sand hybrid: moissanite or carborundum.
		The texture will need to be redone after all.
		Finding the iron/silicon chemical was easier, though it doesn&apos;t have a quite as nice of a name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrosilicon">ferrosilicon</a>.
		Again, new textures will definitely be needed.
		While I was at it, I looked for a mixture iron and carbon.
		The one I found was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite">cementite</a>, though it&apos;s mostly iron with less than a tenth of it being carbon.
	</p>
	<p>
		That left the three hybrids that involve saplings.
		If I&apos;m redoing the first three hybrids, I might as well take a look at the other three to see if they need touching up as well.
		The thing with these hybrids though is that living plant tissue can&apos;t be chemically bonded to minerals the way minerals can to one another.
		These three hybrids would definitely need to lie more on the fantasy side of things, rather than the chemical side.
		I like the designs I have from before, honestly.
		At this point, I think I just need to come up with decent names for these abominations.
		If the names justify the textures, I&apos;ll modify the textures to account for use with a palette.
		If they clash with the textures, I&apos;ll replace the textures.
		The feel I have for the sand/sapling hybrid is some sort of prettified tree that&apos;s somehow still alive.
		For the coal/sapling hybrid, a coalified tree that still lives.
		Both of these are just living fossils of different types.
		The iron/sapling hybrid is an odd one.
		I&apos;m picturing a metal tree, but what that means and how to name it are a bit up in the air for now.
