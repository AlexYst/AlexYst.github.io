	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Today could have been a real disaster.
		First, we were as understaffed as always due to the franchise owner trying to squeeze more money out of us.
		Second, the other new shift leader, who was scheduled to close with me, didn&apos;t come in.
		My understanding is that they hurt their back, but that was a second-hand account.
		Third, the slacker shift leader up and left on us a little bit into their shift, leaving us another person down, and they didn&apos;t even have the decency to let us know.
		They just clocked out and slipped away when no one was looking.
		Those two were the only ones closing with me, so that left me to close the store all alone, and even run the store single-handedly for the last couple hours.
		Thankfully, two great employees stepped up and stayed way past their scheduled shifts to close the store with me.
		I didn&apos;t even ask them to.
		I was going to endure, and just do the best I could.
		I was going to explain to customers why they had to wait at least half an hour for their orders as I ran around and worked all the stations, with wait times only going up from there.
		We&apos;d lose business, and a lot of it.
		I figured that&apos;s what the franchise owner gets for leaving us so short-handed that we can&apos;t even recover from such unexpected events.
		But these two saw how dire the situation was and and offered to stay.
		One even seemed to feel obligated to, even though every time they said such, I told them they didn&apos;t need to stay.
		And they gave up plans with their partner to keep the store running.
		The other one really wasn&apos;t feeling well, and could have really used some rest.
		but they too stayed behind to make sure the store ran successfully.
		Three people was not enough to run things as well as would be ideal, but being great workers, it kept things going well enough that we didn&apos;t even have to stay late to clean.
		We got out soon after closing time.
	</p>
	<p>
		The slacker shift leader actually told me they were quitting today, but that they&apos;d work the rest of today&apos;s shift.
		They just weren&apos;t showing up tomorrow.
		But then they disappeared on us without even having worked an hour.
		Overall, I&apos;m glad they&apos;re gone, but their timing was terrible, and they should have given us their two weeks&apos; notice.
		Call me paranoid, but they may have tried to sabotage things a bit before they left, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, the bar code printer stopped working.
		When I was made aware, I went to investigate and try to fix it, but they got defensive, and said they&apos;d already tried flipping it on and off and even unplugging it and plugging it back in, and that it was just broken.
		I didn&apos;t get a good look, but felt odd staying after they were clearly not wanting a second opinion.
		A couple minutes later though, I went to take a look when they were gone.
		It was unplugged, and not at the wall, but at the little box in the middle.
		Y&apos;know, like the little boxes in the middle of laptop cords.
		I think it might be a transformer or something.
		After plugging it back in, it worked perfectly.
		They&apos;ve always tried to fight the bar code system and not use it, but I thought it was an honest mistake at the time.
		but then the back register wouldn&apos;t let me sign in to perform a cash drop.
		To sign in, we have to use these fingerprint scanners that I find creepy.
		The one on the back register wasn&apos;t reading though.
		Having just dealt with something that was unplugged, I thought to follow the cord and see if it too was unplugged.
		It was.
		And there wasn&apos;t enough tension there for it to likely come unplugged accidentally.
		There&apos;s a good chance it was deliberate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, they&apos;re gone.
		And as they quit without giving notice, they hopefully won&apos;t be allowed to return again.
		It&apos;d be nice not to have to work with them again.

		My original plan for World&apos;s Navel was to drain the ocean, build a city, then restore the ocean and flood the city.
		As I mentioned before though, the ocean isn&apos;t actually deep enough to make that plan work out.
		I have a new idea though that wouldn&apos;t need nearly the height.
		I think I&apos;ll embed mese lamps into the sea floor to light it up.
		Not being able to see the bottom is the main reason I even need to drain the ocean while claiming the sand, anyway.
		I can&apos;t see where it is, I can&apos;t see if I got it all, and I drown too easily while I fumble around in the dark.
		Not that it&apos;ll help after I&apos;ve already drained the ocean and taken the sand, but it&apos;ll still look nice to have it lit up, and I think it might have a sort of magical feel to it to have spots of light throughout the ocean.
