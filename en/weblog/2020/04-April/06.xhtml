		I didn&apos;t get around to building any textures today, but I have a pretty good idea of what the silicone block and silicone lump should look like.
		The lump would just look like the old-style lumps, but redrawn so it&apos;s a slightly-different shape.
		The block would be sort of a solid colour, except with a shaded outline and a very slight chequerboard pattern in the pixels.
		That&apos;d give it a little bit of a feeling of texture, but it&apos;d mostly look smooth.

		I think I might be cancelling <code>alchemy2</code> again though.
		I like the hybrid idea.
		It&apos;s pretty awesome, if you ask me.
		The way it adds countables to <code>liblevelup</code> is pretty problematic though, to say the least, especially with just how many it would add.
		If I can find a way to properly represent the spirit of the various countables in their hybrids without making the hybrids countable, I might pick the mod back up, but for now, it just seems infeasible.

		By now, releasing the magical crystals mod I coded and never perfected has become but a dream.
		There just won&apos;t be a way to get it to serve its original purpose.
		I think I&apos;ll take the model and the node&apos;s non-function-based code and just use it to build a craftable decorative node, and release that.
		It looks cool, it&apos;s just never going to lead to anything that <strong>*does*</strong> anything cool.
		It&apos;ll be super easy to maintain it as just a decorative node mod too, so it&apos;s not really going to add much extra work for me.
		I even have a crafting recipe in mind.
		The only difficult part will be coming up with a name for the mod.
