	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		My academic advisor asked me for my password, my browser make, and browser version, so they could reproduce the error.
		My response:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			I no longer have my password.
			Someone reset it on me on the fifteenth.
			I&apos;m not sure what they set the password to.
			I think it was someone at the school that reset the password for testing purposes, but I&apos;m not sure who did it or what the password is now.
			I was never notified as to what the password got set to.
		</p>
		<p>
			Usually, I use the latest version of Mozilla Firefox available to my system.
			Currently, that&apos;s Firefox 68.4.1esr.
			You&apos;ve also had me try Google Chromium in the past, and the same problem occurred in Chromium.
			I&apos;m unsure what version of Chromium that was, but at the time, it was the latest version available to my system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>

	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I fully intended to say once again that the password doesn&apos;t matter anyway because the site doesn&apos;t let me submit one, but I forgot, so I wrote a second letter:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, I forgot to reiterate something I&apos;ve said repeatedly in the past, too: the site doesn&apos;t allow me to submit an email address and password at all.
			What the password is isn&apos;t relevant anyway, as the problem occurs *BEFORE* the login.
			The site is sending 403 errors instead of sending the JavaScript files.
			The tech team should be looking for any sort of IP address blocking, User-Agent blocking, or any other sort of blocking.
			The server is blocking the browser from downloading certain files, including JavaScript files and images.
			If the site is allowing you to submit the password, it means you haven&apos;t succeeded in reproducing the error.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>

	<p>
		I&apos;ve started trying to lead the coniferous litter into spreading all the way across the southern edge of the map.
		That&apos;ll make it so it only need to spread its way north as I dig out the ocean and prepare the land for the town.
		I&apos;m pretty much going to use coniferous litter as the default dirt topper, and add grass as I see fit, like for yards or something.

	<h2>Red hair</h2>
	<p>
		I found that one of my remaining beard hairs has turned ginger red on me.
		Maybe red hair has less pigment than brown hair, and the follicle has been damaged enough to produce less pigment but not damaged enough to go blonde?
		I don&apos;t know.
		I&apos;ll have to remember to talk to my doctor about it next week at my <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> appointment.
