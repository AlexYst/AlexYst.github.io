		I&apos;ve gotten the screwdrivers and fire starter drawn.
	</p>
	<p>
		I finished removing all the dirt, which funnily enough, means it&apos;s time to start laying the dirt back down.
		My intent is to thin the dirt out, to spread it to places that lack dirt.
		I&apos;ve started laying down dirt, but I have a long way to go.
		I preserved some of the coniferous litter too, so it&apos;s now spreading across the area and making it more natural-looking.
		There are several holes left from where I mined out sand and gravel pockets, and I&apos;m not quite sure what to do with them.
		I could fill them in with cobble, I suppose, before covering them with dirt.
		Another option would be to put water in the bottoms, the cover them with dirt, and use the area for farming.
		For now, I&apos;m lining their bottoms with dirt and putting fences around them so I don&apos;t fall in as easily.
		Filling them in later, be it with water pockets or cobble, would probably look a lot nicer though.
		There are also a few caves around that I didn&apos;t create, a least some of which would probably make good mines for while I&apos;m here.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I started planting mushrooms across the river.
		You can see the red patch on the map where all the red mushrooms are over there.
		It&apos;s rather inconvenient to try to meet my daily mushroom quota over there though, so I&apos;ve started planting them again over on my side of the river.
		This time, I&apos;m planting them in rows, alternating between red and brown.
		My shovel&apos;s been looking worse for wear, so it&apos;d be helpful to get another batch of red ingots ready.
		If worst comes to worst though, I still have the ingot that was meant for my screwdriver.
		I could build a shovel with it instead.
		I&apos;d rather have a screwdriver though, and just grind for another batch of mushroom ingots so I can make a ten-pack of shovels.
	</p>
	<p>
		I need to figure out what I&apos;m going to line the riverbed with.
		I&apos;m thinking permafrost or permafrost with stones would look nice.
		Permafrost with stones would be the nicer-looking option, but it&apos;s also the node that&apos;s more limited.
		Both these nodes, as well as permafrost with moss, are something I was planning on using in my flooded city.
		Then again, you can&apos;t see that deep, so maybe it&apos;d be better to use those nodes in the river after all.
		A trek north may be in order.
		I also need more pine and snow for the base.
		These things would also be found along the way to the permafrost, which is in the northeastern corner of the map.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m considering ripping out the softwood floor (hard woods come from deciduous trees, and these floors are pine) of the base and replacing it with wool.
		It&apos;d be sort of like carpet.
		I&apos;d still do the wooden ceiling pattern squares, but the pattern form the floors of the place would be formed from the colours the wool was dyed.
		I&apos;m not sure what sort of patterns to put on the floor just yet though.
