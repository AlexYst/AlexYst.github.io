		I took one of my final exams tonight, before getting ready to head to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting I actually ended up having to miss due to technical difficulties.
		That exam had to be taken today due to the learning journal assignment in that course, but I wasn&apos;t up for the other one.
		I&apos;ll take it tomorrow.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve finished exploring that cave under the planting bed, and it turned out not to be a good mine at all.
		It really doesn&apos;t go very far before looping back on itself and then just ending.
		The looping made it look like it was branching in different directions and there might be resources to be had down each path, but this really isn&apos;t the case.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started harvesting trees again for the pine logs.
		I forget what I needed the logs for.
		I ran out of the pine needles and gravel I&apos;d gathered before I had my mushroom tools, which absolutely destroy those nodes, and started digging up sand for sandstone to use to stack instead.
		I had sandstone back at the pagoda, but didn&apos;t want to head home when there was sand nearby I had to clear anyway.
		I got distracted by the sand, and forgot what my initial intentions had been.
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up wearing my new shovel down enough that it could be merged with my old shovel to repair the two.
		When I performed the repair though, the tool&apos;s repair counter was left at zero, even though the tool shown in the craft preview had shown a repair count of one.
		I&apos;d put the counter-incriminating code in the preview function, but not the actual crafting function!
		It was easy to fix the code for future repairs.
		What was a bit tricky was fixing the repair count of the existing tool.
		Everything&apos;s been set right though.
		I&apos;m glad I haven&apos;t released this mod yet.
		Clearly, it needs more testing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve got so much sandstone now that I can&apos;t store it all in hammerspace.
		I built some chests to store it, but then later, took it all out to the ocean with me.
		I&apos;ve started filling in the water from the southern edge of World&apos;s Navel.
		I won&apos;t have nearly enough sandstone for this job, but when I&apos;ve laid it all out, I&apos;ll go get some of my dirt and start filling with that.
		It&apos;ll take several loads, but when I&apos;ve used all that, I&apos;ll start digging out the sandstone and dirt, and moving it further up as my inventory fills.
		This is going to be a massive project, and I&apos;m not sure if I can complete it with only the materials I have now, but I might as well get started.
		The alternative is to keep building more chests to store the materials as I gather them, and I&apos;ve already got too many temporary chests lying around the edges of the pagoda&apos;s ground floor.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did some searching in the source code, then some scouting on an extended map, and it seems there are blueberries to the warm south, as well as in cold areas.
		In fact, all eight level-building elements that are missing from World&apos;s Navel are present in the south.
		South is almost certainly the way to go.
		It&apos;s a bi too early to plan that far ahead, but I just can&apos;t help myself.

<section id="GNOME">
	<h2><abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr>&apos;s incompatibility with <abbr title="GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</abbr></h2>
	<p>
		As mentioned in a previous entry, <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> has been silently preventing my canary from generating due to its incompatibility with <abbr title="GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</abbr>.
		I was planning to get my laptop switched to Debian with <abbr title="Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment">LXDE</abbr> to permanently fix the problem, but for today, the plan was to simply use <abbr title="Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment">LXDE</abbr> on PureOS just long enough to sign the canary.
		No dice though.
		It seems that simply having <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> and its component installed is too much.
		<abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> Keyring, or whatever it is that&apos;s hijacking <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> requests, does it when using other desktops too.
		I have no idea how to get around this.
	</p>
	<p>
		I ended up having to skip my <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting tonight, even though I was really looking forward to it.
		Instead, I stayed home, backed up the data on that laptop, and installed Debian so I could get my canary signed properly.
		It&apos;s going to be a while until my next website update due to my break from school that starts tomorrow, so the canary can&apos;t wait until by break ends.
		What a pain.
		I hate <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> and my Lirbem laptop so much.
		This thing is seriously the most irritating and frustrating laptop I&apos;ve ever dealt with, aside form laptops running Windows.
		And now that the thing&apos;s on <abbr title="Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment">LXDE</abbr> like it should have been all along, I have to use an external mouse, which is cumbersome and annoying on a laptop.
		I&apos;m never buying a laptop from Purism again unless they start producing quality hardware.
		I&apos;m just doing to have to deal with the proprietary <abbr title="Basic Input/Output System">BIOS</abbr> from other laptop vendors.
		Freedom is important, but freedom without even the most basic functionality - such as a left mouse button - isn&apos;t feasible for daily use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I had the new system installed, I found <abbr title="GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</abbr> still wasn&apos;t working.
		I spent the entire time I should have been at the meeting just researching and testing my system.
		I even tried manually signing things, and I&apos;d only get errors about pinentry not existing.
		I tried installing <code>pinentry-curses</code> only to find that it was already installed.
		I tried editing the <abbr title="GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</abbr> configuration file to use this version of <code>pinentry</code>.
		A couple times, I ran <code>pinentry --help</code> to try to get help, even though that wan&apos;t giving me any useful information.
		Or so I thought.
		The final time, I noticed that it was telling me that it was called <code>pinentry-gnome3</code>.
		What.
		It was using the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> <code>pinentry</code>!
		I told the package manager to purge that application immediately, and found that doing so would cause it to remove the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> Keyring as well.
		Seriously?
		Why in Squiddy&apos;s name was the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> Keyring installed!?
		Yes!
		Remove the <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> Keyring!
		The $[GNOME] Keyring has brought me nothing but trouble, and is not welcome on my machine!
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t know what happened after that.
		<abbr title="GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</abbr> was still failing.
		I rebooted a couple times, trying to reset <abbr title="GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</abbr>, which didn&apos;t work.
		Then without any further changes that I&apos;m aware of, <abbr title="GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</abbr> started working again.
		I&apos;m not sure what the issue is.
		I think <abbr title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</abbr> is done haunting me for now though.

<section id="camera">
	<h2>Camera</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;d missed my meeting, which was frustrating, and I had half an hour to get my bike ride in before midnight and grab a photo for the day.
		I went to set the time on the camera, as I&apos;ve had it set to what it&apos;ll need to be set to when Daylight Saving Time is ended forever in my state, so it would show up as having been taken past midnight, which I didn&apos;t want.
		Unfortunately, I found the date was off again.
		I&apos;m not sure why, but this thing can&apos;t keep the time properly, and most of this week&apos;s photos have teh wrong date imprinted on them again.
		Should I get a new camera?
		It seems like a waste, but these incorrect timestamps are starting to really get to me.
