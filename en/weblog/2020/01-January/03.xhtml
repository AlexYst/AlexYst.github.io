	<h2>Bag law</h2>
	<p>
		I had a customer asking for a bag today, and it was <strong>*so*</strong> satisfying to be able to tell them that starting on the first of this month, it&apos;s been illegal for us to give out plastic bags, which are the only bags we&apos;ve ever had at our restaurant.
		They wanted the bag to contain one marinara cup, too, which is just so wasteful.
		We have lots of customers that want plastic bags to contain one or two items.
		It&apos;s seriously ridiculous, and I&apos;ve had to comply this whole time without even getting to tell them off.
		But now, I don&apos;t have to comply.
		It&apos;d be illegal for me to comply.
		I&apos;m legally required not to hand out plastic bags.
	</p>
	<p>
		A bit after that, I learned from one of my fellow bag-hating workmates that the penalty for giving out plastic bags would be that our franchise owner would have to pay a couple-thousand-dollar fine.
		Nice.
		I wasn&apos;t sure what the penalty would be, but I&apos;m super hyped that there is one, and that it&apos;s more than just a slap on the wrist.
		And they disclosed too that they hid the remaining bags we had left over; the ones it&apos;d be illegal for us to hand out now anyway.
		There won&apos;t be any mistakes; people won&apos;t hand them out without realising yet that it&apos;s now illegal.
		I&apos;m sure the franchise owner would be happy to hear they won&apos;t be paying the fine because of our store, too, though I don&apos;t know about the other stores in the franchise.
		Not my problem though.
		I found it hilarious that I hadn&apos;t even noticed that the bags were even missing.
		I didn&apos;t look where we keep them, as there wasn&apos;t any way I was going to be handing any out now that I don&apos;t have to.
		The person-in-charge also came by, as they&apos;re covering for the head manager, who seems to be on vacation for two months.
		They&apos;re away for two months for something, in any case.
		So we talked to the person-in-charge about the hidden bags, and they were on-board too.
		I mean, they have to be, it&apos;s couple-thousand-dollar fine that it&apos;s their job to avoid, but knowing they&apos;re on board for sure gives me a bit more confidence in telling the customers they can&apos;t have bags.
		And a couple of us have talked to the head manager as well, who seemed unenthusiastic, but certainly didn&apos;t try to fight this.
		Hopefully, if people want to use bags, they&apos;ll start bringing their own reusable ones.

	<p>
		I drew the picks, swords, axes, and shovels today.
		I still need to draw the screwdrivers and fire starter, but those can wait a bit longer, I suppose.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve cleared away all plants and fungi from my island, and have cleared away most of the dirt and sand.
		I probably would have finished, but I kept seeing things just a bit deeper in one of the caves I came across in the island.
		I tend to not leave a cave as long as I see something worth taking, even if I really don&apos;t want to be there.
		Sand lured me in, then sand, gravel, dirt, and coal kept luring me deeper.
		Eventually, I made it out a second surface entrance, which turned out to be on the mainland, just across the river from my island.
		Seeing that, I&apos;m going to have to go back later and make the path more-easily traversal, and certainly light it up a bit.
		Because I know I&apos;ll be back, I don&apos;t feel as bad leaving stuff behind, so I&apos;m giving up on the cave for now so I can finish more work on my island.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten much more of the base done.
		The first floor has walls, a ceiling, and doorways now.
		I haven&apos;t put in the windows, but I will in due time.
		I also plan to decorate the floor and ceiling with embedded logs.
		It&apos;s rather wide open, as it&apos;s not really intended to be a home.
		It&apos;s a bit of a pagoda-like structure that I plan to store emergency materials in.
		It makes a decent place to work from for now, and depending on what direction I head when I leave this region for another, I may come back and operate out of this place when I move to an adjacent region, as it lies right on the border of where I&apos;ll be working for now.
		I don&apos;t really have the snow I need to continue work on this place for now.
		I plan to have at least three floors, not counting the single basement, with each one getting progressively smaller.
		I&apos;ll probably be able to get away with more floors, but we&apos;ll see.
		The basement will have a single lava node and thee water nodes arranged such that both water sources and stone can be generated.
		Due to the presence of lava, the entire room will be made of stone, which is why it&apos;ll be in the basement.
		The above-ground portion of the place will be made of pine and snow.
		The ground floor will likely be empty, having more than enough space for chests while operating out of it, and perhaps I&apos;ll leave the furnaces there too.
		The first floor might be a bedroom, though maybe I&apos;ll make that the second floor.
		The second floor, or maybe the first, will store a bunch of spare seeds and saplings.
		The top floor, being the smallest, won&apos;t have much in it.
		It&apos;ll have a chest or two containing one stack of everything needed to regenerate everything that can be regenerated, except for the lava and water, which will be in the basement as I mentioned.
		Or maybe I&apos;ll scrap the basement floor and put it in buckets in the chest(s), but I feel like there&apos;s no need to store three buckets in the place.
		This top room will keep stuff I don&apos;t intend to ever need to use, but if somehow I didn&apos;t have these things, I could retrieve them to start generating materials.
		Really, it&apos;ll just be sort of a world-building thing though.
		That pagoda is there for emergency use if people need it, but there won&apos;t be any emergencies and I&apos;ll be the only person actually there.
