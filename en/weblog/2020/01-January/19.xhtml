	<h2>Bottle redemption</h2>
	<p>
		I took another load of bottles to the redemption centre.
		I would have probably had time to get the third and hopefully final load there too, but I was too excited to get an actual house built in Minetest, so I did that instead.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve excavated one of the dungeons.
		It&apos;s not one of the more interesting ones, but it should do for now.
		I chose it based on it&apos;s location: it&apos;s the southernmost one I know about, making it closest to where I&apos;m working at the moment.
		I was a bit worried it wouldn&apos;t work out as the basement of my house, as I had to dig away the sand around it, which would obviously make it stick out of the ground further.
		I thought it&apos;d be too far, and in fact, it was.
		At one spot though, it barely sticks out at all though, so I can use that as a basis for the design of the house, and make it look like the height of the cobble in other places is due only to the shape of the landscape.
		It should work fine.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t think I mentioned it before, but one of the main reasons I need a proper home like this is so I can start an actual mine.
		I&apos;ve been exploring caves a little bit, but I don&apos;t get mush cobble that way.
		What I need is a mine in which I actually bore down through the stone.
		The exact way I go about this is of little consequence, but I&apos;m thinking of doing it in the form of a stairway leading downward.
		In future mines, a powered railway would be better, but to begin with, I&apos;ll have no iron or mese.
		A simple stairway will fit what I have access to better.
		I noticed the size of my <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr> map while I was planning out the mine though, and realised that given my map&apos;s boundaries, I can&apos;t actually get down to the best mining level anyway.
		The world doesn&apos;t extend that far down yet.
		There&apos;s not an option to set the <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var> boundaries separately, so by limiting my <var>x</var> and <var>z</var> bounds, I knew from the beginning that I was also limiting my <var>y</var> bounds.
		It just hadn&apos;t occurred to me that this limitation put proper mining level out of reach.
		With that in mind, I&apos;m putting of building the Navel Underground.
		I&apos;d intended to clear out a load of stone, and while I was at it, gather all the minerals in that section while doing so.
		Building the Navel Underground later - or even building the underground city in some other region - would be much more lucrative.
		That said, even at proper mining level, the effort needed to clear out that much stone will far outweigh the worth of the resources I get out of it, and I&apos;ll have to find a place to store a huge amount of stone.
		Still, if I&apos;m going to build this underground town, I want to get the most out of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve started building the house on top of the dungeon.
		i tried some new things, and it didn&apos;t really turn out how I&apos;d intended.
		I guess it&apos;s fine as an initial house though.
		And it&apos;s nice to finally have an actual home.
		It&apos;s been odd living out of the bottoms of the unfinished pagodas.
		I might try making a few changes, but for the most part, this place is done.
