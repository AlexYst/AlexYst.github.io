<section id="fraud">
	<h2>Credit card fraud</h2>
	<p>
		I contacted Discover live chat support again about the fraudulent purchases made on my credit card, repeating everything I&apos;ve already told them and adding the new details.
		It took nearly an hour for them to respond, and once they did, there was about a half-hour delay between each of their responses.
		Being my errand day, I didn&apos;t have time for this.
		I ended up having to leave without reaching any sort of conclusion.
	</p>
	<p>
		The conversation started out looking like they were going to help me.
		They pulled up my account details to have a look at the situation.
		But then they went back to their telephone shtick.
		Just before I had to leave because of how late I&apos;d allowed them to make me, they had the gall to ask if I knew when I&apos;d be getting a new telephone.
		Um.
		What?
		I didn&apos;t say I don&apos;t have telephone service for the time being.
		I said I don&apos;t have telephone service.
		Full stop.
	</p>
	<p>
		But yeah, more hours wasted, and I haven&apos;t gotten anywhere with them.
		I told them I&apos;d be back tomorrow though, and I have the day off from work, so we&apos;ll see if an entire day is enough to get them to honour their supposed &quot;zero dollar fraud liability&quot;.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="honorifics">
	<h2>Honorifics</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten the letter mailed to American Express.
		I ended up sending them the copy of the letter they sent me and keeping the original, instead of the reverse as I&apos;d planned to do.
		I&apos;ve circled the honorifics in red, and my letter, as you saw yesterday, is much shorter.
		I might have used black last time.
		Hopefully this time, they actually understand the issue.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="errands">
	<h2>Errands</h2>
	<p>
		Having wasted so much time with Discover support, I didn&apos;t have time for all the errands I needed to get done.
		I had to stick with just the Tuesday drawing that necessitates I even run my errands on Tuesdays, as well as getting that letter printed and mailed to American Express.
	</p>
	<p>
		The school has been so overwhelmingly draining this term that I&apos;m way behind on getting the redeemable bottles I gather at work actually redeemed.
		My bag is overflowing and plastic bottles litter my bedroom floor.
		I&apos;d really been looking forward to finally getting the ones in the bag redeemed today, then gathering the ones on the floor into the bag and having a clean floor again.
		But no.
		The letter from Discover had to arrive last night before work, and Discover had to waste all my time today.
		It&apos;ll have to wait longer.
		Maybe there&apos;ll be time tomorrow?
		That&apos;ll depend on Discover being reasonable though, which I&apos;m not really counting on.
	</p>

<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		The responses from Discover live support were so slow to arrive that I had time to clear out every last remaining apple tree in World&apos;s Navel while I waited.
		Wow.
		I seriously didn&apos;t think I&apos;d have time to do that today.
		I thought I&apos;d be using my time more productively today.
		However, I had to sit at the computer and wait, as the Discover website will log you out every few minutes if you don&apos;t click that you want to stay logged in when the little pop-up comes up.
		You can&apos;t walk away and do other things around the apartment.
		You also can&apos;t go run errands, though I wouldn&apos;t do that while I waited anyway, because it&apos;d take too long and then I&apos;d be the one keeping <strong>*them*</strong> waiting.
		So I just harvested apple trees, with the Web browser window open to the Discover site, so I would immediately notice both the auto-logout pop-up and any new responses from support.
