		The doctor was using a different <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> today.
		Apparently, they&apos;d recently had a patient wanting a Brazilian, but the patient couldn&apos;t take the pain.
		So they got out this other <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>.
		It hurts significantly less, but is a bit more difficult to use because it&apos;s operated via foot peddle.
		So while they had it out, they tried it on me.
		Most of the time, it didn&apos;t hurt at all, and when it did hurt, it wasn&apos;t anywhere close to as bad as the other <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>.
		I was still all tense because some part of me was expecting the pain of the other <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr>, and when it hurt, I flinched much more than I should have because I expected the pain to be much worse than it was.
		It was a pleasant change though.

		My next appointment will be on March 6 at 10:30.

		I set up the new tool textures, aside from the fire starter.
		I decided not to modify that one after all.
		The new textures aren&apos;t noticeably different unless you compare them side-by-side to the old ones, but that&apos;s intended.
		They&apos;re not intended to be overly different, they just needed the correct handle colours.
		I of course added slight spots to the handles as well, but given the low resolution of the textures and the fact that the handles are shown diagonally, the spots aren&apos;t noticeable.
		That&apos;s fine though.
		I also got the tools converted and the ingots retroactively paid.
		Due to mistakes in my own code, debugging the conversion was a bit of a pain, but I figured out where I&apos;d gone wrong eventually.
		As for retroactively paying tool costs, I did that by defining a recipe that converts brown ingots into sticks, and used the recipe to craft as many sticks as I&apos;d put into crafting mushroom-based tools thus far.
		So I paid the ingots I should have, and got back the sticks I never should have paid in the first place.
		I won&apos;t need to craft sticks for a while.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been going through the catacombs replacing torches with flaming coal blocks and putting all the bones from my past deaths into the nooks and crannies in the walls.
		The flames could do with better placements.
		Other than that though, I like it.
		This new setup has more of an eerie feel to it than before.
