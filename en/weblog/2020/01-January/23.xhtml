	<h2>Hair</h2>
	<p>
		I checked my beard and moustache today in preparation for my <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> appointment tomorrow.
		I have two red-orange hairs now, but for the most part, my dark hairs are finally gone.
		I have loads of what the doctor has been calling vellus hair, though I keep thinking that hair might be too long to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellus_hair">vellus hair</a>.
		That hair&apos;s not going away though, and even if it was, it doesn&apos;t mean the trained medical professional wouldn&apos;t be able to identify vellus hair better than I can.
		I really have no reason to question it.
		I just get worried the treatment isn&apos;t working, y&apos;know?
		I tend to get paranoid about things like that.

		I&apos;ve been excavating the dungeons and laying the dirt around them because I&apos;ve been working on the paths connecting them and turning them into catacombs, so having them exposed on the overworld has made travelling between them as I work easier.
		I&apos;m trying to dig away all the natural material and lay dirt everywhere, so I might as well do that near the dungeons first.
		I&apos;ve been working on building the catacombs in order to get more cobble to fill craters left when I dig away all the sand, dirt, gravel, and coal.
		But today, I started running out of dirt.
		I used too much of it to fill water in the far south.
		I figured I&apos;d work south to north, so I&apos;d get it back before I needed it, but due to dealing with the craters, that&apos;s not how I&apos;ve been working.
		I&apos;ve had to switch back to the original plan to get some of the dirt back.
		At first, I thought I was just out of luck.
		I&apos;d forgotten I&apos;d sunk a lot of dirt into filling the ocean, so I thought I was just out of the stuff.
		I thought I&apos;d run out far sooner that anticipated, and the dirt shortage was much worse than I&apos;d imagined.
	</p>
	<p>
		Honestly, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m going to have as much dirt as I need to cover all of World&apos;s Navel.
		Surface dirt generates a few metres thick, so it&apos;s easy to spread thinner, but most of World&apos;s Navel is ocean.
		There is no dirt in most of it.
		I&apos;m hoping the odd pockets of dirt I find in the stone will add up to go a long way, but I doubt even that will be enough.
		What I&apos;m really counting on is the fact that I don&apos;t have to build on top of dirt.
		If I build a house, I can clear away the dirt to expose the bare stone, then use that dirt to cover another place.
		As I add buildings, I&apos;ll clear dirt I&apos;ve placed, and place it elsewhere.
		Paths aren&apos;t likely to be made of regular dirt either, but permafrost or something else.
		Hopefully, there&apos;ll be enough dirt to fill between everything.
		Though if there <strong>*still*</strong> isn&apos;t enough dirt, there is my complete fail safe: snow.
		Snow takes time to farm, but it can be produced in unlimited amounts.
		If worst comes to worst, I can cover the deepest depths of World&apos;s Navel&apos;s ocean with snow blocks instead of dirt.

		I found my way into a new dungeon.
		I thought I&apos;d gotten to all the ones in the cluster I&apos;m working at, but it looks like I&apos;d gotten confused by another overlapping pair.
		I thought one of the dungeons I&apos;d found lead underground, and that the dungeon included a room nearby that I could see the ceiling of embedded in the seafloor.
		I had trouble getting into that room today though, so I made a temporary hole in the ceiling, and found the place hadn&apos;t even been lit up yet.
		I hadn&apos;t torched the place.
		I hadn&apos;t been there.
		This dungeon has some interesting characteristics.
		It&apos;s got single-node-thick platforms of stone attached to a couple parts of the ceiling, but the stone around the dungeon and even the dungeon&apos;s walls don&apos;t reach up that high in places.
		The only good places for connection stairways are exposed to the air, so they don&apos;t really make sense for the catacomb feel I&apos;m going for.
		I debated back and forth about using them anyway, and decided to do it.
		This would be the one place the catacombs would be accessible without entering a basement first.
		But then I remembered that this whole region is going to be flooded at some point.
		I can&apos;t have staircase nodes exposed to the open air below <var>y</var> level <code>2</code>, or they&apos;ll create obnoxious air bubbles.
		I&apos;ll need to cover this area up, and have a really odd-looking basement, but at least this dungeon will be connected to the rest.
	</p>
	<p>
		The stair issue reminded me that I wasn&apos;t supposed to use stairs too low on my house.
		The slabs on the roof are fine, but the stair leading to the front door isn&apos;t.
		I&apos;ve removed it now, and it looks really odd.
		I mean, it needed work before, but now it&apos;s even worse.
		I&apos;m not quite sure what to add to make it look better.
		For now, I&apos;ve just added a bit of dirt.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting, I worked on building myself a Minetest skin.
		It&apos;s far from complete, and it&apos;s amateurish at best, but when it&apos;s finished, using it will be much nicer than being stuck playing as Sam, the default skin.
		I mean, it doesn&apos;t really affect anything in single-player worlds, as I only play in first person mode anyway, but having my own skin will be nice for future use.
		I&apos;d like to get back into multiplayer someday, not to mention that while I&apos;m taking vocal lessons, I&apos;d like to get into streaming if I can, as vocal practice.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the way home, I thought about the mushroom tools.
		I&apos;ve always thought having both the red mushroom tools and the brown mushroom tools was redundant.
		From the very beginning.
		Before I&apos;d drawn a single texture or written a single line of code.
		I mean, both tool sets are identical in function.
		But how could I leave one set out?
		Why should red mushrooms be useful while brown ones aren&apos;t, or vice versa?
		Tonight, I&apos;ve come up with a solution: red ingots will form the head of the tool and replace things such as diamonds or iron ingots in the recipes.
		Brown ingots will form the handles and replace stick in the recipes.
		I got kind of worried near the beginning that my shovel was giving out too quickly, but it didn&apos;t give out as quickly as I&apos;d thought it was.
		It held out rather well.
		These tools are quite durable, and it&apos;d be nice to up their production cost anyway.
		The one down side is that it now makes brown ingots - and thus brown mushrooms - less valuable in most regards.
		With the exception of shovels, crafting any mushroom tool takes an equal amount or greater of red ingots than brown ingots.
		Still, it&apos;s better than the current system.
		In the current system, you pretty much choose one ingot colour and the other then has almost no value, because it&apos;s only if you always use tools of the same colour that you&apos;re able to merge them using tool repair recipes.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess my main focus needs to be drawing the new textures.
		I&apos;ll take the red textures and modify the handles in most cases.
		The fire starter will need a bit more work, but won&apos;t be difficult.
		After that, I&apos;ll need to write some temporary code to convert my existing tools to the new format, including having the unified tool names in the tool tips in the inventory, and also write code to allow me to retroactively pay the brown ingots I would have already paid should the new recipes be the ones that were in place all along.
