	<h2>Tired</h2>
	<p>
		Work last night was really stressful and tiring.
		I finally got a chance to work the pizza dress station again.
		It&apos;s perhaps the worst station in the store, but I&apos;ve been feeling since before my promotion that I never got enough experience with it, which makes me less useful as a manager.
		The pizza dress station also acts as central command for the entire store, so again, if I can&apos;t work the pizza dress station effectively, I&apos;m not as effective of a manager.
		But yeah, that ran me ragged.
		I debated about putting it in my journal last night, but decided it wasn&apos;t interesting enough to warrant inclusion.
		It seems I slept ten hours to recover from that though.
		I slept in this morning.
		I had time to get another load of bottles returned, but I passed on that too because of how tired I am today.
		Instead, I just played Minetest until it was time to go to work.

		I finished drudging the sand out of the river over by the pinewood pagoda.
		After that, I decided that now that I have a source of unlimited cobble, it&apos;d be a good time to start filling in all the potholes left from my surface mining.
		I headed back home to the cobble mine, and didn&apos;t get very deep before I found a cave with sand in it.
		Clearing the sand led me to another dungeon, this one I thought entirely underground.
		But no, this dungeon was another one of the surface dungeons, and I&apos;d dug right into the cave I thought only naturally accessible through it.
		There&apos;s a path from the surface to this area too, as it turns out.
		I&apos;ve connected the two dungeons via a cobble path and stairs, but I haven&apos;t really done much with the rest of the cave yet.
		I might do that some other time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t even manage to gather enough cobble for a decent pothole-filling session, as I spent so much of my freshly-mined cobble on building paths and stairs.
		I&apos;ll get back to mining cobble tomorrow, I suppose.
