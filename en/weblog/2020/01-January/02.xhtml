		I mostly took the day off to recover from the stress of last week.
		I didn&apos;t really get any coursework done like I should have today.

	<h2>Skipping the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting</h2>
	<p>
		I really wasn&apos;t feeling up to going to the <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting today.
		So I didn&apos;t.
		But while I could blow off the meeting, I still had my daily bike ride obligation.
		I haven&apos;t missed a single day yet.
		I headed out to the bike path in the woods and rode for a bit, about an hour after I would have headed to the meeting, if I was going.

	<p>
		I&apos;d gotten nearly the number of mushrooms I needed for my tools and was thinking about building a furnace to smelt them in when I realised that I don&apos;t have any cobble.
		To get cobble, I&apos;ll need a pick.
		I&apos;ve got to craft a wooden pick.
		I could have had one all this time, and it would have been useful for clearing out the coal ore under my base, but I&apos;ve been waiting so I can use the mushroom tools instead.
		Anyway, I need to figure out where I&apos;m going to get stone from.
		It&apos;s everywhere, obviously, but I don&apos;t like wrecking the terrain for it, and I haven&apos;t got a mine yet because I was so focused on mushrooms.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went exploring, hoping to find some cobble in a dungeon chest, but the dungeons are too dark to see in.
		I managed to find a chest anyway by moving my camera around until the chest&apos;s mouse-over text showed up, and while I didn&apos;t find any cobble there, I did find some coal.
		I now had torches!
	</p>
	<p>
		Using the torches, I re-explored other dungeons as well as some new ones, until I found a stone pick and bucket of lava.
		I didn&apos;t quite realise the significance of these two items just yet, but after thinking about it a while, I realised that meant I had as much stone as I could ever want without wrecking the terrain.
		Sweet!
		The dungeon with the lava and pick was flooded, so I headed back into it and produced the eight cobble I needed for a furnace.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another significant find I made was the cotton seeds.
		I say &quot;the&quot; cotton seeds as if they&apos;re the ones I already knew about, but if memory serves me (and there&apos;s a good chance it doesn&apos;t), the ones I knew about were somewhere near the glaciers.
		These weren&apos;t in so cold an area, and may very well be different cotton seeds.
		Anyway, once the mushroom tools are in hand, I&apos;ll be able to work more on the base, and it&apos;ll need a bed at some point.
		I should grow some cotton soon.
		I&apos;ve also got wheat seeds from the nearby grass.
		I brought some of it closer to my base so it could spread, and I&apos;ve been clearing it out of the way as I expand the mushroom farm, moving it over if it drops itself and stashing the seeds if it drops seeds instead.
		Those seeds are why I brought the grass over in the first place.
