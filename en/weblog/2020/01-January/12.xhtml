	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m having trouble getting information on how to configure OpenVPN as a client.
		It doesn&apos;t help that I can&apos;t use the official documentation.
		It&apos;s provided on a website that uses JavaScript to change the page content instead of using separate pages, and the JavaScript appears to be broken, meaning that I can&apos;t actually change the page content to see the parts of the documentation that are relevant to what I&apos;m doing.
		One thing I have managed to find is that the OpenVPN client needs to be configured to know the client machine&apos;s <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
		That doesn&apos;t bode well.
		If true, it likely means I can&apos;t use OpenVPN over <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> using any clever trickery, as it&apos;d need to be configured to use a specific exit node&apos;s <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, and by the time I have the configuration set up, that exit node would no longer be the one in use.
		There&apos;s a chance OpenVPN client can be configured specifically to use a network proxy to reach the OpenVPN server.
		If not, I&apos;m out of luck, and have to throw in the towel.

		I built the mushroom quota tracker I mentioned wanting yesterday.
		It tracks both how many says ahead or behind I am, which means I can now easily stockpile and get the work done ahead of time if I like.
		Previously, if I got extra done, it didn&apos;t really put me ahead, as I&apos;d still need to start from zero the next day to be sure I wasn&apos;t falling behind.
		I could know I&apos;d gotten ahead, but without doing the maths myself each time, I couldn&apos;t know how far ahead I was, not to mention that once I&apos;ve used up more of these mushroom ingots, I&apos;m not going to remember how many I&apos;ve used, so I won&apos;t be able to add up how many I&apos;ve gotten in total to compare it to how many I <strong>*should*</strong> have gotten.
		The other thing the quota tracker does is track how many extra spores I&apos;ve generated.
		These are the spores beyond what would be needed to hit the break-even point and not be losing growable mushrooms.
		In theory, I should work for four stacks of 65535 of each spore type before I leave World&apos;s Navel.
