	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I&apos;d eaten a large bowel of that salad I like, only to afterwards notice that the rest of the batch was rotten.
		Somehow, I&apos;d made it from rotten ingredients without noticing, and had eaten it, again, without noticing.
		I found it difficult not to hurl.

		Yesterday, I got one of the planting beds up.
		Today, I&apos;ve prepared the area around the pagoda for the other three planting beds.
		I then started filling in the ocean with my dirt to empty my inventory so I could gather more apple wood to build the planting beds out of.
		I sort of goofed though.
		I forgot I needed dirt for the planting beds, and I&apos;d used up nearly all my dirt before I remembered.It&apos;s fine though.
		I&apos;ll get ore from clearing the area a bit further fro the pagoda.
		It just means doing things out of my intended order a bit.

	<h2>Credit card fraud</h2>
	<p>
		I received a letter today telling me that Discover has decided to reverse their decision to resolve the dispute on one of the fraudulent charges to my credit card in my favour.
		They sent &quot;proof&quot; that the purchase was legitimate in the form of a copy of the receipt.
		I&apos;m not questioning that the merchant was in the right.
		It&apos;s like I told Discover: my credit card was stolen!
		Supposedly, Discover has zero dollar fraud liability when cards are lost or stolen.
		I guess I&apos;m going to need to argue with Discover support some more when I get time, which might not be tomorrow, but hopefully the next day at the latest.

	<h2>Honorifics</h2>
	<p>
		American Express sent me more junk mail, again addressing me as a mister.
		It&apos;s time to argue with them some more too, it seems.
		This time, I&apos;m copying the letter they sent before I send it back, as last time, they claimed not to be doing it, and as I&apos;d sent the proof, I could no longer even show them what I was talking about.
		I&apos;ve composed a letter to them, and I&apos;ll get it printed and sent when I have time:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello American Express,
		</p>
		<p>
			As I&apos;ve already told you in my last two letters to you, *I AM NOT A MAN*!!
			It is *INCREDIBLY RUDE* to send me letters addressing me as a &quot;mister&quot;.
			Please correct your records and *DO NOT* attach &quot;Mr.&quot; to my name!!
		</p>
		<p>
			I&apos;ve enclosed the mail you sent me, again with &quot;Mr.&quot; circled.
			Last time I wrote, you claimed you weren&apos;t calling me a mister, but here, you&apos;re sending me yet another letter addressed to *MISTER* Alex Yst.
			This is getting *REALLY* old.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
			Alex Yst

	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve managed to find what I think is a configuration option for connecting to the <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> server via a SOCKS proxy, which is exactly what I need.
		However, there seems to be no configuration file by default, so I need to figure out where the configuration file needs to reside, and perhaps I need to configure more than I&apos;d&apos;ve thought, as I&apos;m not sure if there are defaults to fall back on.
		I guess there probably are.
		I don&apos;t have the patience to spend my entire break from school dealing with this school garbage though, especially when I have credit card company garbage to deal with on top of it.
		I&apos;ve written to my academic advisor again:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello Babajide,
		</p>
		<p>
			I&apos;ve been trying for a few days to figure out how to use a VPN as you&apos;ve requested I do, but I haven&apos;t managed to figure out how to get a VPN client set up yet.
			I&apos;ll ask the othe rmembers of my LUG on Thursday night to see if they can help, but if they don&apos;t know how either, I&apos;m not sure I can try a VPN.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
