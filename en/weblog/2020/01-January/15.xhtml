	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I received two emails early this morning from the school.
		The first was an email claiming I&apos;d asked to have my password reset and giving me a link to confirm the password change, and a second telling me my password change was successful.
		Um.
		Yeah.
		I didn&apos;t make that request, and as the confirmation was received in the same mail fetch by my client as the one with the link to perform the password reset, I certainly wasn&apos;t the one to reset the password.
		Honestly, I think someone at the school reset my password on me and is going to tell me later to try using the one they set, after telling me what they set it to.
		Some flaw in the system probably made it so they had to send the link to my email address even though they wouldn&apos;t be (and couldn&apos;t be) retrieving it from my email account.
		The alternative, of course, is that someone has breached my email account and the one thing they targeted with it was one of my university accounts, and that seems incredibly unlikely.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, if my hunch about what&apos;s going on is correct, it means they didn&apos;t understand the problem at all.
		I can&apos;t log in because their website is refusing to send the JavaScript files that their page is coded to require for performing logins.
		That means no password will work.
		It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t know my password or am using the wrong one.
		It&apos;s that the site won&apos;t allow me to submit an email address (the site uses email addresses as usernames) and password at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I&apos;ve sent a letter to my academic advisor:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			I just received a pair of emails from the school.
			One told me I requested a password reset, which I did not, and enclosed a link to perform the reset.
			The other told me the reset had been successful.
		</p>
		<p>
			Honestly, I think some department in the school did the reset and it&apos;s nothing to worry about.
			The alternative would be that my email account has been compromised and the only thing the attacker used it for was to get into one of my university accounts, and that seems unlikely.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think the school reset the password because they think a password reset is going to somehow help me log into the self-serve portal.
			There are two flaws with this reasoning though.
			First, the problem isn&apos;t a bum password.
			The site is sending 403 errors when the browser requests the JavaScript files needed to log in, which means that the site isn&apos;t allowing me to submit email addresses and passwords at all.
			No password can be submitted, and a reset doesn&apos;t change that.
			Neither correct nor incorrect passwords can be submitted because the school&apos;s website is blocking me from loading the JavaScript files.
			And secondly, because I didn&apos;t perform the reset, I now have no idea what the new password is.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyway, I just thought I&apos;d give you a heads up in case it wasn&apos;t the school that changed the password.
			It was probably the school, but I have no way to know for now.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>

<section id="fraud">
	<h2>Dealing with credit card fraud</h2>
	<p>
		My plan for the day, which I formulated yesterday, was to use Discover&apos;s &quot;secure messaging centre&quot; to submit a request for help, then while waiting for a response, which wouldn&apos;t come same-day, contact live support again.
		I&apos;d try to slowly escalate the issue to higher supervisors.
		I found though that the &quot;secure messaging centre&quot; no longer allows you to type messages. I worked my way through the tree of options, expecting a text box at the end, but no dice.
		Instead, a generic message was sent on my behalf.
		That wasn&apos;t helpful.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yesterday, partly at work on my breaks and partly at home after work, I composed a message I&apos;d send on both channels:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			About a month ago, I dropped my wallet and a thief used my credit card to make $170 of fraudulent purchases.
			I contacted a Discover representative, who told me to dispute the charges.
			Now, I&apos;ve gotten a letter back claiming &quot;proof&quot; that one of the charges is legitimate, with that &quot;proof&quot; being a copy of the thief&apos;s receipt.
			I assume the same will happen with the other four fraudulent charges as well.
			Of course a purchase was made, so there would be a receipt.
			That&apos;s not the issue.
			The issue is that the thief stole my card and wasn&apos;t authorised to make those purchases in the first place.
			What do we do about this?
		</p>
		<p>
			I do not have telephone service.
			I cannot call any numbers.
			I&apos;ve spoken with several Discover representatives now.
			None of them have given me a straight answer, aside from the one that told me to dispute the charges, and disputing the charges hasn&apos;t worked.
			I hate to be that person, but this is getting really old.
			Do I have to get a lawyer in order to get Discover to honour their supposed &quot;zero dollar fraud liability&quot;?
			I&apos;ve been told repeatedly by Discover representatives that I&apos;m never responsible for unauthorised purchases, but here you are, holding me responsible for these unauthorised, fraudulent purchases.
			None of you have said that I&apos;m not held responsible for unauthorised purchases *if and only if* I have access to a telephone.
			No.
			You&apos;ve all claimed that I&apos;m *never* held responsible for unauthorised purchases.
			So, given that I don&apos;t have telephone service and don&apos;t have access to a telephone, how do I get these fraudulent charges reversed?
			Or is your &quot;zero dollar fraud liability&quot; a lie and I am held responsible for fraudulent charges after all?
		</p>
		<p>
			Honestly, I&apos;d settle for a straight answer.
			If you aren&apos;t going to honour your &quot;zero dollar fraud liability due to my lack of telephone service, please just say so.
			I can&apos;t say I agree that it&apos;s a valid reason not to uphold your advertised promises, but at least we can move on.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		All of that is true, too.
		Even the last bit.
		I won&apos;t press Discover any further if they just admit I&apos;m out the money, and I won&apos;t take any legal action whatsoever if they do.
		Of course, I&apos;ll also never use the card again and I&apos;ll advise anyone I know who&apos;s considering getting a Discover account that it&apos;s a bad idea, explaining that the &quot;zero dollar fraud liability&quot; doesn&apos;t apply to every case, which is only fair, but I won&apos;t take any legal action and I&apos;ll get out of their hair.
		So anyway, being unable to submit that message via the first intended channel, I submitted it only via the other.
	</p>
	<p>
		As expected, they pushed the telephone support option.
		But then they had the gall to ask if that was helpful!
		That was rather cheeky of them, and I did not appreciate it.
		I replied that it was unhelpful, and they they&apos;d neither given me a straight answer, nor provided a way to get Discover to make good on their advertised promises.
		They escalated the issue and their supervisor was the next person to message me.
		Nice.
		I wasn&apos;t even quite at the point I was going to ask for a supervisor yet.
		The sooner, the better though.
		The faster we get through this, the more of my day I have left to do something actually interesting.
		Or even just get some errands run, such as getting these obnoxious bottles redeemed for deposit and out of my bedroom.
	</p>
	<p>
		The supervisor tried to push the telephone support option several times.
		I had to keep saying that I have no access to a telephone, each time making sure to additionally ask if I was just out the money.
		I&apos;ll pay the price for dropping my wallet if I have to.
		But I will not be told I&apos;m not out the money while still being out the money.
		I will not stand for that!
		The supervisor put me in touch with a billing assistance specialist, and told me that they may or may not be able to help.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, I experienced a network connectivity issue, and ended up logged out.
		I got back in, and saw no message from the billing support specialist.
		It only took them about fifteen minutes from the time of my last message to respond, but it felt like much longer because I didn&apos;t know for sure if I&apos;d been cut off and would have to start the process over.
		Again though, they wanted to push the telephone support option.
		When I wasn&apos;t going along with it, they presented a bunch of things to try in order to acquire a line to call from.
		They asked about a Google account, calling from a disconnected mobile, borrowing one from a neighbour, and using one at a store.
		Seriously, when are they going to get it through their thick heads that doing this via telephone is <strong>*not*</strong> an option?
		And to finish their message, they asked why I couldn&apos;t call.
		So I went through their options.
		I said a member of my <abbr title="Linux User Group">LUG</abbr> had set up a Google account for me recently, but that I don&apos;t think google allows you to call without a telephone.
		If they could correct me on that and show me how, then fine, we&apos;ll do that, though I didn&apos;t make mention of that.
		I said I don&apos;t have a disconnected mobile.
		Technically, I do, but that mobile&apos;s antenna doesn&apos;t seem to work.
		It can&apos;t reach the towers.
		And if it could, it&apos;d still be disconnected.
		I think they were asking about Wi-Fi calling, which would require proprietary software that I can&apos;t install because it&apos;s proprietary.
		But even if I could install it, the device doesn&apos;t have Wi-Fi, so that wouldn&apos;t work either.
		I said I don&apos;t think any of the local stores offer telephone use as a service.
		This is true, I don&apos;t think they officially offer this as a service, though I think an employee at at least one of them would let me borrow the store telephone anyway if I explained the situation.
		Not the point though.
		There&apos;s absolutely no reason why this needs to be done via telephone.
		I skipped over the neighbour option and hoped they wouldn&apos;t notice.
		Next, I replied that why I couldn&apos;t place a call is because I have no telephone service.
		That seems rather obvious, I think.
		And to finish, I asked once more if that meant that I&apos;m just out the money.
	</p>
	<p>
		They then said they were &quot;reviewing alternate options&quot;.
		Perfect.
		That&apos;s what I need.
		Alternate options.
		I&apos;ll go with whatever option they like, provided it isn&apos;t telephone or fax, doesn&apos;t require proprietary software, and doesn&apos;t require signing up for services that require <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>; require telephone number verification; or maliciously discriminate against us <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, they seemed to have given up, and decided to call the fraud team via telephone <strong>*themself*</strong>.
		Awesome.
		I&apos;d hoped for that early on, but had given up on that s a possibility by today.
		I&apos;ve learned not to ask for that sort of thing, too.
		You don&apos;t seem to get it if you ask for it.
		But anyway, it seems the problem will probably be resolved now?
		The lesson here, dear readers, is that if you&apos;re willing to put in the hours, no, you don&apos;t have to place telephone calls, almost ever.
		You might have to deal with telephones to get a job or something, but aside from that, you don&apos;t need to have a telephone line, and you don&apos;t need to give in to requests that you borrow a telephone to contact businesses that claim that for some topics, calling them is just the only way.
		It&apos;s not the only way.
		It just isn&apos;t.
		Pester them enough via whatever other channels you can, and if you&apos;re in the right, they&apos;ll eventually give you what they&apos;re required to.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, I was fully expecting to be out the money.
		Don&apos;t do what I&apos;ve done unless you&apos;re either as adamant as I am or you&apos;re willing to forgo what&apos;s rightfully yours just to make sure you&apos;re doing the right thing.
		Personally, I can&apos;t stand how society - including businesses such as Discover - assume that everyone has telephone and operate under the premise that we all do.
		I can&apos;t stand this artificial dependency on a technology I consider to be garbage.
		I will push and push, just to make it clear that assuming telephone access isn&apos;t okay.
		I do it in hopes that companies will change, but with full knowledge that unless enough people do the same, my actions won&apos;t have the desired result.
		Still, if I don&apos;t do this, it makes me a part of the problem.
		If I give in and use a telephone, or if I allow them to claim they&apos;re providing service to non-telephone-owning users, it makes me one of the bad guys.
		And I can&apos;t live with that.
		I will set aside entire days of my life and dedicate them to arguing with support if I have to, just to avoid the guilt of not doing that.
	</p>
	<p>
		I understand a telephone call was still made on my behalf.
		But it was made by a company to itself.
		If that&apos;s the way a company chooses to operate internally, that&apos;s their deal.
		As much as i can&apos;t stand the telephone system, I&apos;m not claiming telephones should never be used.
		My stance is that no one should be required to have a telephone to get what they need or what they deserve.
		That means that customers, clients, patients, et cetera shouldn&apos;t be required to have telephone service to get help.
		If departments within a business call one another, or if a customer/client/patient <strong>*chooses*</strong> to make contact via telephone, that&apos;s just fine.
		Not everyone has to be as opposed to telephones as I am.
		It&apos;s the false dependency I mentioned that&apos;s the real problem.
		I&apos;ve spoken with others, and it&apos;s not just me: often times people feel like telephone service is a necessity.
		Some of them want it, regardless of it being a necessity or not, but they still think it&apos;s not optional.
		For example, I live in a ghetto.
		The people here are poor.
		I&apos;ve recommended to some that are doing particularly poorly that giving up things such as telephone service and television service would save a lot of money.
		They think they <strong>*have to*</strong> have the telephone service though.
		That they can&apos;t function if they give it up.
		This is what I fight against.
		Telephone service should not be seen as a necessity.
		There shouldn&apos;t be something that you simply cannot get done because of lack of access to a telephone line.

	<p>
		I worked on World&apos;s Navel some more while waiting for responses from Discover support members.
		I&apos;d planned to focus mainly on building the apple wood pagoda, but other things took a lot of my time.
		I needed more cotton to make wool from, but harvesting cotton plants yields more strings than cotton puffs.
		The strings fill the inventory of my chests, and they&apos;re next to worthless.
		So I turned my planting beds to churning out mushrooms instead.
		With more mushrooms, I&apos;ll have something to cook and can burn the strings away to power the furnaces.
		I&apos;m going to need loads more mushrooms before I can be done with all the strings though.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did get the ground floor and the floor of the first floor completed though, aside form the carpet.
		I&apos;ve also completed the planting beds, done some slight mining to get the cobble needed to build the needed hoes to complete the planting beds with, done the carpet of the ground floor of the pine wood pagoda, and started clearing some of the ground material across the southern edge of World&apos;s Navel.
	</p>
	<p>
		I feel like my current goal is to grow mushrooms so I can clear out my string-filled chest and pour more apple logs and straw into the construction of the apple wood pagoda, again to clear space from chests.
		My main motivation for the time being is to empty unnecessary items from storage.
		Adding to the pagoda requires cotton too though, which means producing even more strings to burn.
		I guess mushroom-farming it the top priority for now.
	</p>

<section id="camera">
	<h2>Camera problems</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve figured out the issue with the camera, and why it can&apos;t keep time properly: it&apos;s losing power!
		A while back, I dropped the thing.
		I forgot to note it in my journal right away, and by the time I remembered, I&apos;d forgotten what day it had been, so I wasn&apos;t able to go back and add it as a note at the end of the entry.
		One of the two pegs holding the battery door on broke off.
		The other one held it in place just fine, so I continued on.
		But apparently, that peg has been getting worse and worse over time.
		It&apos;s not positioned such that it can properly hold on the door alone, as it&apos;s meant to work as part of a pair.
		At this point, the battery door has to be held on tightly just to keep the thing powered on long enough to get a photo, which is a bit difficult to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;d planned to get some bottles redeemed for deposit today, but it was raining, and I didn&apos;t want to lug bottles through the rain.
		So instead, I went out to get a new camera.
		This one looks nearly identical to the old one.
		The only visual difference is the model number.
		Maybe it has updated innards.
		I just don&apos;t know.
		It should last longer though if I&apos;m more careful with it.
