	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		I forgot to mention in yesterday&apos;s entry the technical difficulties the night before.
		I mean yes, I&apos;m inexperienced, and that lead to a lot of the problems that night.
		But when things really went downhill was when the pizza-dressing machine decided stop functioning altogether.
		I&apos;d barely been keeping up, though I had a lot of pizzas I&apos;d made with the machine and put on the racks, ready to be thrown in as needed.
		I was slightly faster than the demand.
		But then we ran out of pizzas, as without the machine, I wasn&apos;t fast enough to keep up, not to mention that I was having to spend a bunch of what little time I had to try to debug the machine.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, tonight was a mess again.
		It started when the morning crew didn&apos;t leave us as many pre-made pizzas as they were supposed to, so I had to struggle to keep up with demand while also trying to make up for the deficit.
		I wasn&apos;t doing too well.
		And I should have been.
		Again, I need a lot more experience at this.
		But then, the pizza-dressing machine decided to only put small splatters of marinara on the pizzas instead of the full amount, making those pizzas unsellable.
		I tried to debug the machine, failed, gave up, and started making the pizzas by hand like in the old days.
		But we had more people working the pizza dress station back then, and far fewer customers.
		There&apos;s no way we can keep up with demand when making pizzas by hand any more.
		The more-experienced of the two assistant managers ended up having to come in and deal with the machine.
		They got it working, but I was double behind by that point.
		Both my own failure and the morning crew&apos;s failure added up to leave us in quite a bind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ugh.
		I hate working this station.
		But yet I have to keep trying to make sure I&apos;m the one working it so I can get better at it.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I&apos;ve decided to try connecting all the surface-level dungeons I find via underground paths.
		It should prove to be an interesting labyrinth.
		I&apos;ll connect any dungeons I find that aren&apos;t on the surface too, but I&apos;m not going to go looking for those.
		If I come across them, I&apos;ll connect them, but otherwise, I won&apos;t worry about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, what this means for me right now is that I need to drain the ones I know where they are, and start digging stairways from them, as well.
		If I simply focus on the stairway I started, it&apos;ll get rather deep and not have landings at which to connect other stairways.
		All the stairways should be about equally deep at any given point, so when they get close to one another, I can connect them without any messy filling and rebuilding.
		That&apos;s pretty much the alternative: remove stairways that are too long to make room for intersection landings.
	</p>
	<p>
		I used the Minetest mapper to show me where the ocean dungeons I&apos;d covered up were.
		It turns out I&apos;d failed to fined the southernmost one when I went to build my house.
		There&apos;s one even further south by a bit.
		I focused on excavating that one today.
		After finishing, I filled in the ocean around one that was still submerged, then excavated that one as well.
		I started preparing a third one to be filled and excavated, but I&apos;ve set that one aside for now.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using the cobble I&apos;ve gotten my hands on so far, I filled as many craters as I could.
		The world looks a lot nicer now.
		You can really see the difference on the <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr> map.
		There are still a lot more craters to fill though.
		As I fill, excavate, and connect more dungeons, I&apos;ll get more cobble, then use it to get back to filling the remaining craters left by my surface mining.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the stone walls of the stairwells connecting the dungeons, there are a number of holes.
		Most are left from the removal of coal ore.
		A couple are places I accidentally dug the wrong node.
		I think I might put bones in these holes, and call this labyrinth the Navel Catacombs.
