		It&apos;s a bit bothersome to swim across the river repeatedly as I travel back and forth between the two pagodas while I work.
		The issue isn&apos;t even the swimming itself.
		It&apos;s the scaling of the cliff on the opposite side of the river, both ways.
		So now, I&apos;ve built a bridge.
		I was always planning to build a diagonal bridge, most likely out of stone or sandstone blocks.
		The area I put the apple wood pagoda in though is very steep, and I ended up needing to put in a bunch of stairs leading up to the doorways.
		I supported the stairs with logs, and I liked the design so much that I came up with this log-supported bridge design to use instead.
		The downside is that logs can&apos;t be placed diagonally, so I&apos;ve had use an easier-to-build design that isn&apos;t as impressive.
		That might be for the best though, as I&apos;m not really all that great at building yet, so my diagonal bridge would have been quite a risky design to try to pull off.
	</p>
	<p>
		What I really need, of course, is a nice railway.
		I won&apos;t have the supplies for that for a long time though, most likely.
		I do plan to hollow out a huge space in the stone though and call it the Navel Underground.
		It&apos;ll include a subterranean railway, though I wouldn&apos;t exactly consider it a subway.
		I won&apos;t be able to put rails in what will become the Navel Ruins though, due to the air bubbles the rails would produce once I re-flood the place.
		All fast transportation lines are going to need to either be high above the city or down below it.
		Anyway, the Navel Underground will have more than just a transportation system.
		I&apos;d like to make it into an entire underground city to complement the Navel Ruins.
		Perhaps when the people of the Navel Ruins were flooded out, some of them moved to the new water surface, but others moved underground.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most productive thing to do right now would be to farm mushrooms.
		It gets rather boring waiting for them to grow though, so I instead worked on clearing away thick dirt and replacing it with a thinner dirt layer.
		That seemed to keep the pagodas out of loaded range though, preventing the mushrooms from growing.
		There&apos;s nothing to do at the pagodas but wait for crops to grow at the moment though.
		I need more wool to work on the apple one and more snow to work on the pine one.
		I can&apos;t grow cotton to make wool from until I clear all these excess strings out of my chest by burning them as fuel for something such as the mushroom ingots.
		I guess I could have gone snow-gathering, though I would have ended up with more pine logs along the way and I need space to store those.
		I could have gone mining, and I did a bit to get cobble to fill in some holes in the ground with.
	</p>
	<p>
		For now though, if I&apos;m not going to be farming, I think I&apos;ll try to get some land set up for building on.
		In particular, once I&apos;ve hit a surface dungeon - or technically, an underwater dungeon that I&apos;ve dried out - I can set up an actual home.
		I&apos;ve been using the incomplete pagodas as bases of operations while I try to establish a good start to this world, but they&apos;re not meant to be homes.
		And I&apos;ve been planning on turning any exposed dungeons I find into basements of houses.
		In theory, I think it&apos;d work out great.
		In practice, I have yet to see.
		The primary issue is that they&apos;re embedded in the sand, and all the sand needs to be cleared away.
		Normally when I play, I leave the dirt in place, so a dungeon flush with the dirt would work just fine as a basement.
		I always clear away all the sand though, and here at World&apos;s Navel, I obviously need loads of dirt to serve as a canvas to build a town on in what&apos;s now the ocean.
		Once I clear the sand, there won&apos;t be any nice-looking cover for the stone, so I&apos;m needing to thin out what dirt there is in order to have anything but bare stone.
		I guess I could also grow boatloads of pint trees to get snow from and use that to cover the stone, but having dirt for most of the area will save me a huge amount of time overall, I think.
		But anyway, the sooner I get the landscaping done, the sooner I&apos;ll reach the first dungeon.
		I&apos;ve already filled in the area to clear out the water.
		I just need to work my way there to clear out the dirt and sandstone to replace it with a thinner dirt layer, and I&apos;ll have a home location.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe I&apos;ll cheat a bit.
		Instead of working my way there naturally, I could look at older versions of the <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr> map to locate exactly where it was (as I&apos;ve forgotten) and just clear a path over to it.

		I couldn&apos;t talk my fellow <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> members to help me set up a <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> connection.
		They started by talking to me about getting my certificate signed by the <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> provider, and after I told them the providers I&apos;d found didn&apos;t offer forms to get certificates submitted for signing and instead provided user names and passwords, they thought the <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> was a bad idea.
		I explained that I knew the <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> wouldn&apos;t be secure or anything, and explained the situation with the school.
		They explained why the <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> wouldn&apos;t be a good idea for that, and I explained that I know that, but that I need to be able to tell the school I tried it so the school would move on.
		But no, the other <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> members didn&apos;t want to waste their time.
		And I get it.
		They said the school&apos;s tech department must be on crack.
		Hilarious.
		I&apos;ve never gone that far, but I&apos;ve certainly called them incompetent a few times in my journal over the years.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I wrote back to my academic advisor:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			A couple of the LUG members knew how to set up a connection to a VPN server, but after explaining the situation, they said that the only way it would even help was if the VPN server is behind the university&apos;s firewall.
			If the server was behind the firewall, it&apos;d allow the browser to bypass the firewall, and that might prevent the 403 errors if your Web server is misconfigured and blocks certain IP addresses.
			If your server isn&apos;t blocking IP addresses though, even a VPN behind the firewall won&apos;t work, and if the Web server does block IP addresses, the IP address blocking is the problem and should be fixed, not the lack of VPN.
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, a VPN doesn&apos;t seem to be a working solution, and even if it was, they didn&apos;t want to help me set up the VPN connection and I was unable to set it up on my own.
		</p>

			Thank you,<br/>
