	<h2>Drudgery</h2>

		My academic advisor asked again what browser and version I&apos;m using.
		I already told them.
		In fact, to respond, I simply copied the paragraph with my answer from last time from the quoted chain of replies in the very letter asking again:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Hello <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>,
		</p>
		<p>
			Usually, I use the latest version of Mozilla Firefox available to my system.
			Currently, that&apos;s Firefox 68.4.1esr.
			You&apos;ve also had me try Google Chromium in the past, and the same problem occurred in Chromium.
			I&apos;m unsure what version of Chromium that was, but at the time, it was the latest version available to my system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you,<br/>
			~ Alex Yst
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		My first instinct was to point out that they&apos;d already asked and I&apos;d already answered (in addition to copying the paragraph so they don&apos;t have to look back through the reply chain), but I&apos;m just not feeling it today.
		So they get the more polite, simple repeat.
		I kind of hope they notice how familiar the paragraph is though and realise I already told them last time they asked though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Y&apos;know how I said I&apos;d try to register next term and if it worked, I&apos;d ignore the fact that the site is now blocking only one of my two computers?
		Yeah, that&apos;s not happening now.
		I mentioned in a past journal entry how they reset my password on me.
		It didn&apos;t connect to me at the time, but that means that whether I&apos;m still blocked or not, I can&apos;t get in.
		It no longer matters whether I&apos;m blocked or not.
		I mean, it still matters.
		It very much matters.
		But they&apos;re going to have to manually register me either way.

		I got a bit disoriented today when I was digging out the catacombs to get more cobble.
		I extended the wrong path as a result.
		I think I&apos;ll have to add an extra turn or two to that particular path just to make it function properly, which will make it windier and more labyrinth-feeling.
		So it&apos;ll work out in the end.
		I&apos;ve also decided to remove the burning coal blocks and put torches back up.
		There&apos;s just no good place for burning coal blocks in the catacombs.
		I&apos;ll be more inclined to use them in the Underground, as there&apos;ll be so much more space down there.
		I&apos;m not sure yet how deep of a space I&apos;ll dig out for the Underground.
		I mean, I know how deeply the Underground will be placed, but I don&apos;t know how tall it&apos;ll be.
		It&apos;ll extend horizontally though to reside beneath the entirety of World&apos;s Navel.
		It&apos;ll be a massive, box-shaped cavern, and I&apos;ll put a town made almost entirely of things found underground there.
		There&apos;ll be a lot of stone-based materials.
		It&apos;ll mostly be a very grey town.
		But it&apos;ll also have minerals, lava, silver sandstone, and things such as that.

		I&apos;ve considered the small gathering of dungeons I&apos;ve been working with to be a village for quite some time now, and as I mentioned in past entries, I plan to erect houses atop each one that touches the surface, making the dungeons into basements for these houses.
		Until now though, I hadn&apos;t even thought to dignify this village with a name though.
		How odd.
		At work, I thought about what to call the village, and finally decided on the name &quot;Corvia&quot;.
		This will be Corvia Village.
		It&apos;s just a made up word, but when I tried using actual words, it made it sound like the village had some affinity for whatever the word normally described.
		For example, I briefly considered calling it &quot;Coriander Village&quot;, but this game doesn&apos;t include that plant, or include spices of any sort.
