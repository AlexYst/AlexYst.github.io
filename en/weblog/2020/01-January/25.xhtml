	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was living with someone with a severe drug problem and they started stealing my money to fund it.
		I don&apos;t remember the rest though, aside from the fact that it was quite surreal, and the dream didn&apos;t seem to follow basic logic.

	<h2>Misdeed</h2>
	<p>
		When I checked my schedule for the coming week, I thought I didn&apos;t have Thursday night off.
		That&apos;s the one night each week I&apos;ve told both the head manager and the assistant manager currently writing the schedules that I&apos;m not available.
		I immediately planned to talk to one assistant manager tomorrow to get it fixed and the other on Tuesday because they made the schedule, but wouldn&apos;t be in until then.
		While the head manager is gone, only the assistant managers - not also the shift leaders - can authorise shift exchanges.
		I reasoned back and forth about reaching them sooner by only available not-in-person method: telephone.
		The only contact method the assistant manager that&apos;s currently writing the schedules has left us is their telephone number.
		I finally decided it&apos;d be fine because the calling number didn&apos;t represent me, but the store, because it was the store&apos;s telephone I&apos;d be using.
		After all, I don&apos;t even have telephone service.
		Also, I it was only being used to call a store employee.
		The number would in no way be used as a handle for me personally, and I was only using the telephone for a legitimate business purpose, as a part of my job.
		I wasn&apos;t making the call for personal reasons.
		In any other case, it&apos;d be wrong to call, but in this case, it was a grey area.
		Let&apos;s be honest.
		It was still wrong, one hundred percent, for me to make this call, but was close enough to okay that I was going to do it, given how frustrated I was.
		But then I picked up the telephone and looked at the schedule again.
		I&apos;d read the wrong person&apos;s schedule, and mine is the same as usual.
		It&apos;s a good thing I hadn&apos;t quite called yet.
		I mean, I still did the wrong thing by breaking down and almost calling.
		The fact that I was going to call was itself a misdeed, even though I didn&apos;t follow through because circumstances changed, but at least this way, I didn&apos;t also pester the assistant manager for something they didn&apos;t even do.
	</p>
	<p>
		I feel guilty about even considering trying to resolve the matter via telephone.
		I guess this here is my confession, so I can move on.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I took a look at the mineral depths again today.
		I knew I couldn&apos;t get down to proper mining level, but I assumed I could at least get deep enough to scrape up a little of each mineral within the map&apos;s boundaries.
		It turns out not though.
		The first mineral I looked at, mese, is completely off the table.
		That means no mese lamp posts, which means no spreading dirt types in dark areas.
		My heart sank when I read those lines of code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I considered my options.
		I could expand the world generation limit.
		That would mean World&apos;s Navel would be larger and my two pagodas would be in entirely the wrong places.
		I&apos;d need to tear them down.
		I could just deal with the fact that some materials are out of my reach for no good reason.
		That doesn&apos;t seem great either.
		In the end, I decided to try hacking the source code.
		If I could remove the vertical limit without removing the horizontal limits, things would mostly be fixed.
		The one problem I see with this is that I wouldn&apos;t have used the dungeons to build catacombs, had I not thought I wouldn&apos;t be able to reach proper mining level.
		I would have had the staircases all lead to the Navel Underground instead.
		I feel like I now haven&apos;t used the available generated features to their fullest capacity.
		I don&apos;t want to start over though, as I&apos;ve put nearly a month into this world, and all I&apos;ve done so far is boring prep work.
		I haven&apos;t even gotten to get started on my town yet.
		If I start over, I&apos;ll need to do all that prep work again.
		I guess I&apos;ll continue with the catacombs as they are.
	</p>
	<p>
		So anyway, I found what I thought was the code to limit map generation, and it looked easy enough to remove the part that limits in the <var>y</var> dimension.
		It seemed to be just two lines of a conditional that opened this one block of code.
		I thought for sure I&apos;d&apos;ve broken <strong>*something*</strong> by deleting them.
		Or more likely, I hadn&apos;t, this wasn&apos;t even the block of code I needed to look for.
		However, once recompiled, I found in a test world that the change had done exactly as I&apos;d wanted it to.
		So yeah, that&apos;s a thing now.
		I can now go as deep as I&apos;d like.
		Deeper than I&apos;d like, even.
		Deeper than I ever plan to dig.
		And the catacombs?
		I guess they&apos;re a failed project, but I feel like I need to finish them anyway so they won&apos;t be an <strong>*abandoned*</strong> project.
		Or maybe instead, I should block off the turns in the stairways and continue them in the directions they should have gone, had I known I was going to fix the world generation limits.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I&apos;m careful, I might be able to edit this limitation code in more complex ways in the future.
		From the very beginning, I wanted a way to limit the generator to generate terrain within a rectangular prism that <strong>*isn&apos;t*</strong> centred on (0, 0, 0).
		For my initial region, sure, that&apos;s a good place to limit generation to.
		But later, it&apos;d be nice to move to a new region without having to generate parts of the adjacent regions when I work too closely to them.
		I don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll get to those regions, and it&apos;d be nice if their terrain was generated using any new Minetest or Minetest Game features present at the time they come into use.
