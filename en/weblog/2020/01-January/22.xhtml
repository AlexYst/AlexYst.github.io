	<h2>Unproductive</h2>
	<p>
		I planned to be productive today.
		Really I did.
		But I ended up just resting at home and playing Minetest.
		Yesterday took a lot out of me.
		I did finally get out for a short bike ride after nightfall, but I didn&apos;t even leave my apartment until daylight had ended.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a week&apos;s time, school will start back up.
		I think I&apos;ll just take the rest of this break from school off too, to be honest.
		This has been the worst term I&apos;ve ever had, and I could use the recuperation time.
		I don&apos;t have anything pressing to get done at the moment, anyway.
		I have some reading and writing I intend to do, which can wait until much later.
		And I have a wide variety of more important tasks to get done that have had to be put on hold until other people take care of other things.
		I can&apos;t get any of my important tasks even worked on just yet.
		I should do the reading and writing, to be honest, but I think I&apos;d rather just sit on my hands for a bit and just relax while I can.
		I deserve it.

	<p>
		I need cobble to fill craters with, so I need to dig staircases leading from the dungeons, as clearing those paths is my best source of cobble at the moment.
		I don&apos;t want to dig the staircase of any one dungeon too deeply until I can see on the map where all the staircases connect to the dungeons, so I started filling and excavating the next dungeon.
		Working on that resulted in more mining-induced craters though, so I need more cobble.
		I decided to go straight to the dungeon to work on the stairways there without having the dungeon entirely excavated, but found no good places to build a stairway.
		Interesting.
		Basically, I look for caves or stone walls attached to the dungeons, and use those as starting points for the stairways.
		I try to avoid messing with the cobble, mossy cobble, and cobble stairs, as those are part oft the dungeons themselves, and I&apos;d prefer they remain intact.
		I think this dungeon&apos;s going to have to remain disconnected.
		Weird.
	</p>
	<p>
		One by one, I checked the surface dungeons in the cluster I&apos;ve been working near.
		I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve pointed it out before, but dungeons in Minetest in at least the past few versions seem to generate in clusters as far as the <var>x</var> and <code>z</code> coordinates, and in columns along the <code>y</code> coordinates.
		Anyway, I made it to what I thought the final surface dungeon in this cluster, and it might have been the most unusual of them all.
		The entire floor of the lowest level was made of four metres of sand.
		Under the hollow part of the rooms and passages, this sand layer could be found.
		Under all the walls though, was stone.
		So by clearing away all the sand, I ended up with taller rooms, with the top half made of cobble and mossy cobble, and the bottom half made of stone.
		I needed to extend the stairway from the upper floor to reach the new floor of the lower level, but nearly every spot on the walls of the lower level became a prime candidate for a stairway into the catacombs.
		I was frozen with indecision.
		I finally decided I&apos;d work on the stairway from the upper level, as there was only one spot that looked like it&apos;d work, but it turned out that spot wasn&apos;t deep enough, and I couldn&apos;t put a stairway there without it being accessible from the surface; from outside the house that would be built there.
		That wouldn&apos;t work.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, I don&apos;t know.
		Maybe I&apos;ll load the lower level up with stairways, and this&apos;ll be the heart of the catacomb labyrinth.
	</p>
	<p>
		I headed home to get my pinewood fences from storage to make a sort of balcony, as two doorways now just led to one-way drops, and I wanted to connect them in a reasonable way.
		When I tried to return though, I ended up in a different dungeon.
		I think two of the surface dungeons are so close that I mistook them for one on the map, and this time, I&apos;d made it to the dungeon I&apos;d tried to reach last time.
		This one had a bizarre room with a three-metre-thick sand floor, but also with almost no cobble or mossy cobble lining it.
		Most of the room is just stone.
		It&apos;s an interesting candidate for attempting to turn into a hub of some sort.
		I ended up making a mistake when finding where I&apos;d put stairways, so I missed one.
		I was a bit frustrated once I&apos;d found it, as I&apos;d already done some critical planning in how to connect things up that I would have planned differently, had I known about that stairway, and I&apos;d already gone too far into the construction for changing what I&apos;d done to be ideal.
		The mistake is going to make the catacombs in that area a little more confusing, but I guess that&apos;s actually a good thing, whether it&apos;s what I actually want or not.
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to filling, excavating, and laying dirt, and I&apos;ve nearly finished the next dungeon.
		I should be able to finish it tomorrow.
