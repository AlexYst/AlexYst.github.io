<section id="bags">
	<h2>Illegal bags</h2>
	<p>
		The person-in-charge is covering for the head manager while they&apos;re gone these couple months.
		They were working today, and I mentioned the customer from Tuesday that was asking if we had bags still even after being told they&apos;re illegal now.
		The person-in-charge had more information on the law.
		It seems the fine is only $250 per bag given, not the couple thousand dollars I&apos;d been told before.
		That&apos;s not as expensive as I&apos;d been led to believe, but still a heavy enough fine that businesses will avoid breaking the law.
		I&apos;m glad too to have a solid number now as to just how much of a fine would be levied.

	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I finished my other final exam for the term.
		Now I don&apos;t have to deal with school again until near the end of the month, when school is back in session.
		And hopefully by then, my vocal lessons will have started.

	<p>
		I&apos;d forgotten just how irritating it is to play Minetest with a mouse instead of a touchpad, not to mention how it hurts my wrist to use a mouse on a laptop, as I don&apos;t have a proper desk to use it at like I would with a desktop machine.
	</p>

		I did a fair amount of ocean-filling, though I still have much more to do.
		I&apos;ve started clearing the apple forest along the southern border of World&apos;s Navel in preparation for clearing out all the dirt, but I don&apos;t really want to store all this wood.
		With that in mind, I think I&apos;m going to start work on the second of the four pagodas: the apple wood and straw one in the southwestern corner.
		To the northwest will be a decrepit stone one, and to the northeast, a stone pagoda in good repair.
