		I finally took the time to do another home <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> treatment.
		It&apos;s hard to find the motivation when the treatments don&apos;t seem to have had any effect at all and the results are long overdue.
		I think I&apos;m three weeks behind, at this point.
		I think I&apos;m going to quit keeping track, and just continue the treatments on an as-I-care-to basis.
		I just don&apos;t see me sticking to the schedule on this any more.

		I&apos;m still rather frustrated about the catacombs.
		I&apos;ve decided I might not bother completing them though.
		I can sort of wall off the parts I wouldn&apos;t have dug out if I&apos;d known I&apos;d be able to make the Navel Underground and just pretend those tunnels don&apos;t exist.
		I&apos;ll continue working on them for the time being though, just to get the cobble I need for filling craters with.
		I need to go back and collect all the bones I put in the walls if I decide to do away with the catacombs though, as well as the torches and coal blocks I scattered about in the tunnels, as I&apos;ll want all these things for other projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve also started filling parts of the ocean with silver sand.
		I by far don&apos;t have enough sandstone for the job, and I&apos;m a bit nervous now about using dirt to supplement, seeing as I didn&apos;t have any dirt when I needed it before.
		I have little use for the silver sand for the time being though.
		I used a bit of it to make glass before, and I&apos;ll eventually want to make silver sandstone blocks and bricks, but for the time being, it&apos;s definitely expendable, and I&apos;ll of course be getting it back as I dig out the filled ocean.
		It&apos;s not like I&apos;ll be losing it altogether.
	</p>
	<p>
		At work, I was thinking about eventually streaming, and was inspired by the fern I put in the small house I&apos;m calling a home for the time being.
		To be clear, I don&apos;t intend to camp in that house forever either, and will move out just like I moved out of the pagodas, but I don&apos;t have space to build my actual base yet until I finish draining the ocean.
		It&apos;ll probably be some sort of castle or fortress.
		But for now, living in a tiny, cramped house is better than living in a structure not even intended to be a living quarters.
		Anyway, I thought about talking about how the fern was no spider plant, but Minetest Game doesn&apos;t have spider plants.
		That&apos;s when it dawned on me that I could try building my apartment within the confines of the game world.
		That could be interesting.
		I might even make that my main base, and have the fortress just be some other place I build and visit.
