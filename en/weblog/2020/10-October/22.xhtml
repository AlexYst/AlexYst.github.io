	<p>
		Over the past few days, I&apos;ve been grinding away at all the pine needles I&apos;ve stashed in chests while I didn&apos;t have any mushroom tools to properly process them with.
		I think I&apos;m about halfway finished now, but wow, I&apos;ve got a lot of needles left.
		Perhaps I should have just put up a ladder to the brown mushroom and not built a full wooden tower to it.
		In truth, I&apos;d planned to use ladders on the mountain on my island, but then I realised that while the land the mushroom was on is above my home, it&apos;s not actually attached to that island, but an adjacent one.
		At that point, I thought the tower might be a better way to get up.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, I started working on removing the beach sand around Mushroom Tower and replacing it with silver sand and flint, but then I realised that my time and resources would probably be better spent on the main roads.
		The location of my mine isn&apos;t where I initially planned for it to be due to the shape of the stone beneath where I&apos;d thought would work out, and I ended up moving it closer to the bridge without remembering that I should check its location against the future bridge&apos;s location before digging.
		I&apos;ve been building all my stuff a bit more south than I otherwise would just to make sure to stay out of the bridge&apos;s way while it hasn&apos;t been built yet and its location isn&apos;t so plainly visible.
		Most of all, I wanted to keep everything out of the bridge&apos;s blocks, in case a redesign made the bridge larger than I thought it would be.
		One node closer though, and the mine would have crossed over into the bridge&apos;s blocks.
		I would have been really annoyed if that had happened, and would likely have reverted to a previous backup to correct it.
		In any case, having the bridge built would prevent such issues in the future, as I don&apos;t really mind things crossing over into those blocks as long as the bridge comes first.
		Additionally, I&apos;ve sort of been planning my second outpost since I first explored my boundaries in order to generate the terrain and get the full map filled out for my journal entries.
		One of the dungeons to the south looks like it could be a good starting point for the outpost, but it&apos;s very close to where the bridge needs to go.
		It&apos;d be safest to have the bridge built before Pine Tower Outpost&apos;s storage room fills up and I have to construct a new outpost with a bigger treasury, so I can use this dungeon effectively.
	</p>
	<p>
		So along that line of thinking, I made sure of my bridge plan in a temporary creative world, then started clearing the path and putting in bridge supports.
		I ran out of silver sand fairly quickly though, halting progress and requiring me to dive back into the mine.
		This could have been prevented if I&apos;d remembered this task sooner.
		It&apos;s even on my list of goals while at this outpost!
		It doesn&apos;t really matter though, as the task I put that initial silver sand and flint toward was going to need to be completed one day anyway.
		I might as well have gotten started.
		Anyway, work on this bridge is going to be taking not only a lot of cobble, but also a lot of fuel, as I&apos;ll need the usual stone blocks and stone bricks.
		I&apos;m kind of overstocked on saplings and pine needles at the moment, so any productive use of those is welcome.
		While my storage room isn&apos;t even close to filling up, the thought of it filling sort of worries me a bit.
		It&apos;d also be nice if I could reduce its inventory before I have to craft any more chests.
		Once the mass storage room at Dream Tower is built, having lots of chests is going to be a goal.
		In fact, I won&apos;t even consider the storage room complete until it&apos;s stocked with a full chest of chests.
		For now though, while I&apos;m at such a humble outpost, building extra chests seems like a waste of resources.
		Besides, without the sort of large sorting system a full mass storage room has, finding things I need can mean searching several chests, and having more chest means having more chests to search through.
	</p>
	<p>
		After building bridge supports all the way out to Original Island, I went back to the southern dungeon to explore a bit.
		My intent was to search around for any chests I&apos;d missed before when I didn&apos;t have any coal to craft torches out of, but after I got there, I ended up cleaning up the lowest level of the dungeon a bit.
		I started the slight renovation due to the broken staircase leading down to the place, feeling it&apos;d be a pain if I ever went down there without supplies with which to build my way back out if I ended up there before setting up the place to live in.
		I ended up also clearing out the sand, gravel, and coal ores though too, then filling in the misshapen holes I left with stone bricks.
		I not only repaired the missing spot in the stairs with stone brick stairs, but also extended the stairway down to the newly-deepened floor that resulted from clearing out the sand.
		It&apos;s an oddly-shaped room, but I think it&apos;d make a good treasury when I do end up moving in.
		I wouldn&apos;t exactly say it&apos;s large enough for the job, but it&apos;s the largest room in the dungeon, not to mention that this dungeon would just be another outpost and not a full base anyway.
		It doesn&apos;t need a full treasury, and if it had one, it&apos;d be my base, rather than another outpost.
		It&apos;ll be a step up from Pine Tower Outpost, while I&apos;m still gathering supplies for Dream Tower, assuming I even find cotton seeds by that point.
		Without the cotton seeds, I can&apos;t really build bases or outposts except over near the spawn area, as I won&apos;t have a bed with which to set my spawn point.
		It&apos;d be a pain to respawn so far from my resources and need to venture back to my base to prepare before venturing to my corpse to recover what I lost. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I went back to the bridge-building, only to find I&apos;d messed up the positioning of the supports.
		With where I put them, it&apos;d cause carts to be pushed away from Original Island, rather than drawn towards it.
		Annoyed, my only real choice was to revert to a previous backup.
		I could move the supports, but I wouldn&apos;t be able to restore the displaced natural materials in the right spots.
		Joy.
		So my work on the bridge supports, the dungeon, and much of my mining was simply lost due to my failure to double-check my measurements before starting.
		I ended up clearing the sand again and rebuilding all the supports, though I didn&apos;t get as much mining done this time and I didn&apos;t even set foot in the dungeon.
		I&apos;m still rather frustrated by the time loss, too.
		I&apos;d hoped to put that time toward putting in the bridge supports to the south instead of rebuilding the supports in the west.
