	<h2>Storage</h2>
	<p>
		With hardly any notice, my father decided he wanted to help me move things to the storage unit.
		I&apos;d planned to do laundry last night, but ended up putting it off and getting some sleep instead so I could get up and be ready before he dropped by.
		It was quite a surprise that he decided to help though.
		He&apos;d offered to take the stuff by car before, but knew I&apos;d decline.
		I don&apos;t cause motor vehicle trips when I don&apos;t need to, and am taking this all on foot.
		He offered to come help me get it there on foot last night before laundry though.
		He says it&apos;ll be good exercise, and he wants to spend more time with me anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		His help in physically moving the boxes is welcome.
		What&apos;s <strong>*really*</strong> helpful though is just the scheduling of the trip.
		With him dropping by, I can&apos;t give in to my lethargy when it comes time to go.
		I <strong>*have*</strong> to make the trip.
		Even if he took nothing, just walking with me would be a bigger help than he&apos;ll probably ever understand.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems we&apos;re going again tomorrow.
		So much for sleep.
		I can&apos;t put off laundry another day, or I won&apos;t have clean clothing for work.
		Still, that&apos;s two trips more this week than I would otherwise have gotten in.
		Progress is being made that had previously halted.

		I&apos;ve finished the support pillars for the bridge that are over the land and started on the ones at sea.
		For the ones at sea, I&apos;m building them all up to the surface of the water before continuing them all up to their final height.
		I also built the initial segment of the bridge aside from the rails and railings, just to make sure it came out correctly and that I was building the supports correctly.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve already found one of the flaws in the rune-enhanced tools idea.
		You can only use so many runes in crafting your tools, which is by design, but that makes it so players (including myself) are likely to focus on a subset of the runes available and ignore the others.
		I&apos;d prefer all runes be useful, or probably more accurately, I&apos;d prefer all renewable runes be useful in the case of tools.
		I do want non-renewable runes to have function elsewhere though.
		And while making all renewable runes useful for tools, I also need to prevent a dependence on any specific rune or runes.
		While all runes should be useful, no rune should be practically mandatory.
		Perhaps an even bigger issue is that I haven&apos;t managed to come up with a reasonable rune-based replacement for the mushroom fire starter.
		Without a fire starter, rune-based tools can&apos;t replace <code>mushroom_tools</code>, and if <code>mushroom_tools</code> isn&apos;t fully replaced, I don&apos;t really have a need for rune-based tools, do I?
		After all, I&apos;d rather just craft extremely durable mushroom-based tools even if they take a lot of resources to create.
		Honestly, one of the major advantages of runic tools is that they&apos;d tone down the strength of my tools considerably.
		While my mushroom tools are very costly, they&apos;re also extremely powerful.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did some research on runes, thinking I&apos;d use actual runes for my <code>runes</code> mod, but I&apos;ve decided against it.
		Instead, I&apos;m just going to make up my own, with each based in some way on the element they represent, preferably with very little obvious representation, if any.
		While I&apos;m not sure the <code>runes</code> mod will actually work out for my world, I think it could very well be the next layer in my overall <code>liblevelup</code>-centric design.
		I feel like runic magic is pretty close to what I&apos;d like to get out of <code>liblevelup</code>&apos;s multi-type levelling functionality.
		Once I have a working <code>runes</code> mod, I&apos;d like to develop a number of other mods that actually make use of the runes and <code>liblevelup</code>&apos;s functionality.
		So far, I&apos;ve only designed the sand rune.
		It&apos;s a square with a quarter-sized square in the lower right corner.
		The symbolism isn&apos;t obvious, but it represents how only a quarter of the material remains when you mine sandstone.
		I think I might draw inspiration for the coal rune form torches, due to torches having originally been the only non-wasteful use for coal in the beginnings of Minetest Game.
		I think the runes will come out better, more varied, and perhaps more cryptic if I base them on how the elements were used when they were first introduced.
		I&apos;m probably going to make an exception for the mese rune though.
		The crystal mese element was added when classic mese was removed.
		The mese rune will probably be the scribbled &quot;M&quot; from classic mese though.
		It&apos;s just so recognisable and nostalgic.
		It&apos;ll probably be the only rune I don&apos;t hand draw myself.
		I mean, I&apos;d prefer to hand draw all of them, but I think the effect is worth setting aside that desire for just the one rune.
		That&apos;d also make it the only seven by seven rune.
		The other runes will all be eight pixels by eight pixels.
	</p>

		I realised a few things today while I was at work.
		I think I&apos;ve forgotten about half of them, unfortunately.
		I remember a few things though.
		First, I don&apos;t need the various abilities that are granted by the runes to be unique to any one rune.
		Each tool type will have certain abilities that make sense and certain ones that don&apos;t.
		With that in mind, each tool type will have a separate pool of available abilities, and each rune only needs to have a unique set of abilities across all tools.
		For example, if there are four runes, rune 0 might grant ability A to shovels and ability A to swords, rune 1 might grant ability A to shovels and ability B to swords, rune 2 might grant ability B to shovels and ability A to swords, and rune 3 might grant ability B to shovels and ability B to swords.
		In this case, only two unique abilities are needed for each of the two tools, but all four runes have a separate set of uses and thus has its own purpose.
		I&apos;d like to come up with as many abilities as I can, but at least now I don&apos;t have to entirely halt the release if I can&apos;t come up with thirty-one abilities for each tool type, which would be rather difficult, especially for certain types of tools.
		Also, this is what&apos;s going to let me get away with making the non-renewable runes optional.
		Each can be replaced, it&apos;s just going to take at least two runes to do it.
		Second, the abilities don&apos;t need to be level-based.
		Coming up with a variety of level-based abilities was proving pretty much impossible for me.
		Most of the cool features I could come up with were either present or not.
		There&apos;s no sort of scaling spectrum with them.
		The abilities can be based on the runes, while the basic tool properties - digging speed, durability, et cetera - can be based on the proficiency level with each of the runes used.
		As for the fire starter, I decided to  just call the replacement a &quot;magic fire starter&quot;, and have it cast some sort of effect (based on the runes used to craft it) when it&apos;s used to start fires.
		I&apos;m not sure of any good effects yet, but I think this is the best I&apos;m going to get as far as replacing the flint-and-steel tool.
		As for the screwdriver ... I&apos;m not sure what to have a runic screwdriver do.
		It&apos;s got to have the original screwdriver functionality.
		I&apos;m not sure what I can add to that that would be interesting enough to justify the tool definition but also won&apos;t get in the way.
		I think for consistency, I might have to define a runic hoe, too.
		The only non-renewable tool that doesn&apos;t have a planned runic replacement is the steel hoe, so although the stone hoe is a drop-in replacement for it, I might end up adding a runic hoe anyway.
		I&apos;m not sure what sort of buffs to make available for that, either.
