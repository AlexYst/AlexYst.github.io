		Without <code>mushroom_tools</code>, my resource-gathering cycle has shrunk quite a bit.
		Previously, I&apos;d have to pour everything I had into farming mushrooms before I could really get started, but after that, I didn&apos;t need to farm mushrooms for quite a while and could focus on other resources.
		If I didn&apos;t go back to mushroom farming soon enough though, it&apos;d be another long mushroom grind.
		This time though, I&apos;m farming wood so I can build ladders down into the mine and build tool handles, going down into the mine to get stone for tool heads, and using the tools to farm more wood.
		I&apos;m not having much time or resources for other things, such as getting my first home constructed.
		I&apos;m also not taking care of any of the silver sand I&apos;m finding in the walls of the mineshaft just because I don&apos;t have the cobble to spare for filling those pockets back in, nor am I mining out the gravel in the walls either, both because of the lack of cobble and because it&apos;d be a bit of a waste to do it before I have the levels needed to ensure the gravel converts to flint on the first try.
		Each try matters, given how easily the tools break.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the resource cycle being so short and my not having much to work with at a time, I decided to go with a much smaller house this time.
		I debated about enlarging the foundation and adding more depth with the supports, but it&apos;s just not worth it while I didn&apos;t even have a place to set stuff down.
		I think it turned out quaint though, and I&apos;ve got a slight basement for extra storage, so it&apos;s not quite as small as it looks.
	</p>
	<p>
		I need to go through the code of <code>runes</code> to make sure it&apos;s all clean and whatnot, that proper licensing is present, and that I&apos;ve given credit in the places I&apos;ve used outside sources.
		Once that&apos;s done, I can get the initial repo uploaded and begin work on the real tool buffs.
		I&apos;m curious as to how this mod will go though.
		While the tools defined by this mod to have some magic runes engraved on them, they&apos;re still basically just stone tools.
		It&apos;s amazing how inadequate stone tools really are in this game.
		I wonder what kind of buffs I can add to make tools this flimsy actually worth using.
		In particular, I want to avoid adding extra durability from nowhere.
		One of the main reasons I want to develop this <code>runes</code> mod and not just stick with <code>mushroom_tools</code> is that with <code>mushroom_tools</code>, it feels like I&apos;ve thrown off the balance of the game.
		I&apos;m not constantly consuming wood and stone for tools production.
		It might be the case that I need to add a buff that basically comes from merging enough undamaged tools, so their durability meters basically get combined into one.
		The resource cost would still be the same, but it would mean longer stretches of resource-gathering without needing to stop and craft tools so often.
		Actually, now that I think about it, that could be a regular buff bestowed by certain runes.
