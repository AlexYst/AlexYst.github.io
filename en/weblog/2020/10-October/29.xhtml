	<h2>Punctured inner tubes</h2>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t have the energy to change the inner tube again last night or inspect for whatever problem caused the hole in both this tube and ostensibly the first tube.
		If the wheel were already off, I could have at least inspected for issues, but that back wheel is a beast to wrestle off.
		I figured I&apos;d just bring my bike pump with me to my appointment.
		I&apos;d pump up the tube before leaving, bike there, then pump it back up before heading home.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I tried to inflate the tube this morning though, I <strong>*immediately*</strong> heard the hissing sound of air escaping quickly.
		This tube had ended up with a large hole much quicker than the the last one, which lasted ... I don&apos;t know, as my high stress levels have caused my sense of time to completely break down, but it felt like at least several days.
		I ended up leaving home much earlier than I&apos;d wanted to to make sure I had time to stop and pump up the tube repeatedly as there wasn&apos;t time to change it out by the time I noticed.
		I even ended up skipping breakfast in my efforts not to be late.
		I actually ended up very early though, which was a relief, as I was convinced I&apos;d end up late despite my efforts.
		I ended up having to stop every few minutes, and it made biking so much more laborious than just walking, but I didn&apos;t have the time to walk as I&apos;d not left that early, assuming I&apos;d have my bike in somewhat working order.
		At one of my many stops though, I noticed a staple embedded in the tire; that <strong>*had*</strong> to be the cause of the flats.
		I had two choices: I could leave it in for the time being, which would either leave the hole partly plugged or would leave it held open, or I could pull it out and let the inner tube return to a resting state, in which the hole would either come together a bit and I could ride further between pumpings or it&apos;d open up further.
		Reluctantly, after considering the options, I removed the staple.
		The tire started deflating audibly quicker.
		Drats.
		In hindsight, I should have known that would happen.
		I was in such a hurry that I&apos;d failed to consider the effects of the air pressure inside the tire.
		With the air pushing on the tube from the inside, there&apos;s no way the tube&apos;s hole would close up any.
		The staple was acting as a stopper, not as a jam.
		After my appointment, I walked my bike home.
		It took over an hour, but it was much less effort, especially now that the tube was losing air even faster.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later tonight, I tried the repair again.
		I got the tube changed out and was pumping the new one up when I heard a small pop and the hissing sound was back.
		Joy.
		I checked the hole&apos;s location, and it was pretty close to the location of the hole in the other tube, so there was clearly still a problem in the tire.
		I checked the relevant spot, but found nothing.
		I tried checking the wheel, too.
		Still nothing.
		I inspected the entirety of both, but to no avail.
		I ended up washing both the wheel and tire, thinking maybe I could wash some tiny sharp thing away that I wasn&apos;t seeing, but I wasn&apos;t hopeful.
		I ended up sacrificing yet a <strong>*fourth*</strong> inner tube to the problem just to diagnose.
		I was so unhopeful about the washing though that I pumped the tube up with the wheel detached from the bicycle, knowing that if I was right, that&apos;d save me from having to wrestle it off the bike again, but if I was wrong, I&apos;d have a harder time getting the wheel on after the tube didn&apos;t puncture.
		I can never get the tubes deflated enough for the air not to make the task harder.
		As expected, I lost the fourth tube too.
		This time though, I was able to find the issue: a tiny fragment of rusted metal embedded in the tire.
		I&apos;m guessing it broke off from the staple I pulled out.
		Now the fifth tube seems to be holding air, at least for tonight.
		I pumped it up off the bike again, so I had to deflate it as best I could and wrestle it onto the bike later, but at least I should have transportation to work tomorrow.
		I&apos;m down to one good spare tube though, so I&apos;d better work up the energy for a patching session during this break from school ...

	<h2>Hair removal</h2>
	<p>
		The doctor thinks further <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> work on my face may not be worth it, as treatments have been so ineffective, especially as of late.
		They recommend finding an electrolysis doctor to finish the job.
		Don&apos;t get me wrong, at first, great progress was made very quickly!
		My remaining hair is just rather stubborn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, we&apos;re going to be switching to working on my back now.
		They offered to do my back and front in the same appointments to save time, but the cost is too high.
		There&apos;s no combined price, so it&apos;s the same price as doing them separately.
		With one treatment costing $400 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per treatment and the other costing $500 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per treatment, it&apos;d total $900 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per appointment, and I just can&apos;t afford that all at once.
		It&apos;d be nearly my entire pay for the month.
		I was a bit too exasperated today to keep track of which was which, but I think the back work was the more-expensive one, so it&apos;ll be nice to get that out of the way.
		I chose to do the back work though because I can&apos;t reach my back very well to shave.
		I can keep shaving my front if I have to in the mean time.

	<p>
		I got enough programmed today that I think <code>runes</code> is usable.
		It took a while to get Debug Buff implemented, but I managed eventually.
		The tricky part was what will later become the Thirst buff.
		In testing the Debug Buff buff though, I found something I hadn&apos;t expected: using what will later be the Pruner buff even with a freshly-crafted tool is usually enough to break it.
		In further testing, there were some areas in which the leaves weren&apos;t densely packed enough to one-shot my sword, but wow, the Pruner buff&apos;s not going to be very safe to use without some further work.
		It&apos;s worth noting that the only reason I&apos;ve never noticed this issue in the mushroom-based tools is because of their extreme durability.
		On something as weak as stone tools, each node dug really takes its toll on the health of the tool.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I was out today, and long before I had <code>runes</code> in a playable state, I started thinking about the implications on gameplay.
		With <code>mushroom_tools</code>, I put off most normal gameplay goals and pour all my effort into getting my mushroom farm up and producing.
		It&apos;s the only logical thing to do.
		With <code>runes</code> installed instead, my gameplay style will be more normal.
		Getting the beginnings of a mine set up will be more urgent than setting up a base of operations, but it&apos;ll only need to be a six metres deep, and after that, gameplay will be mostly rather normal.
		I think that could be rather nice.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first goal today was still to travel around the available area to generate the terrain, which also served as an opportunity to find a red mushroom (non generated on my island this time and a pine bush.
		After that, I dug the beginnings of the mine; just deep enough to get the cobble needed to start crafting runes.
		With that, I had what I needed to craft a runic pick, which I can use to mine further tomorrow.
		This time, I don&apos;t need much to go mining because I don&apos;t have so many mushrooms to gather first, so I don&apos;t need the storage room before even light mining has occurred.
		I think I&apos;ll have a cobble base to my home this time just because I prefer having a bit of stone used in my wooden buildings.
		I would have done that last time too, but I sort of needed a pick first and picks were harder to come by, even if they were also much stronger.
