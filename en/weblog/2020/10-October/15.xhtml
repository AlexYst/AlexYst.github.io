	<p>
		I&apos;ve finished my tower; I&apos;m calling it Pine Tower Outpost.
		It really helps that my island is now so much bigger than in previous iterations of the world, so I was able to farm wood quicker.
		Previously, rivers divided the land up into several smaller islands, but now, these small landmasses are merged into one big one.
		Due to the rooms being taller than I&apos;d originally intended, the tower too is taller than I&apos;d intended, but it&apos;ll work out well I think.
		It&apos;s composed of four rooms, each on its own floor.
		The ground floor serves as both an entry room and a storage room.
		With the rooms being larger than intended, I should be able to camp out here longer too, as there&apos;s more space for chests in the mean time.
		The first floor is the furnace room.
		I have no furnaces yet though.
		The second floor is the planning room.
		I&apos;ve left the windows off of one wall and put a few signs there instead with goals I want to complete before moving on from the tower to another home.
		These goals include finding and farming both cotton seeds and brown mushrooms, building the main roads of the now-smaller World&apos;s Navel, and starting a mine.
		I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll actually complete the cotton goal before the storage room fills up and I need to construct a bigger outpost elsewhere though.
		The third floor is the bedroom.
		I don&apos;t have any beds yet though.
		The tower&apos;s still buried in the sand, but I&apos;ll dig it out once I have the tools I need.
		I&apos;ll also build a bridge out to it, seeing as it&apos;s in what will be the water.
		I put it far enough away from what will be the shoreline that I can ensure it won&apos;t be in the way later.
		It&apos;d help if I knew where the shoreline was, but I won&apos;t know that until I&apos;ve cleared away all the sand, and I need a place to work out of before I do that, not to mention that having tools first would be nice.
		It was already a pain to build an outpost - or any structure, really - without tools for collecting the materials.
	</p>
	<p>
		With my home tower complete aside from the furnishings I don&apos;t have materials for just yet - specifically cotton for the bed and cobble for the furnaces - it&apos;s time to work on one of the goals.
		Specifically, the brown mushrooms are needed to get some decent tools going, so I need to locate a brown mushroom sample.
		I found one up in the sky in a test world, so I have a general idea of where the closest sky mushroom is.
		No brown mushrooms exist on the surface-level islands, unfortunately.
		Well, I guess that&apos;s not technically true.
		The &quot;sky mushroom&quot; I mentioned isn&apos;t actually on one of the floating islands, but rather on a bizarrely-shaped, enormous mountain on a nearby island connected fully with the ground.
		Getting up there by hiking isn&apos;t really possible though.
		At the very least, I&apos;d need ladders or need to stack nodes.
		I want to build a taller tower to get there though.
		It seems ... more official.
		It&apos;ll take more effort, as I don&apos;t even have any tools at this point, but it&apos;ll feel like more of an accomplishment.
		I went to scout out the area again in a test world to figure out where the tower needs to be.
		It&apos;s actually just barely outside the boundaries of my posted map, seeing as my chunk size dictates that the world border is actually one block past the map boundaries.
		I&apos;m not building in that border area, but I think collecting a single mushroom sample just so I can craft tools and get started won&apos;t hurt, especially because I know a brown mushroom must exist within boundaries if I build high enough up, but the higher I build, the more otherwise unused blocks are generated.
		I decided to explore higher up though.
		I thought I might get lucky and find blueberries, as unlikely as that would be.
		Instead, I found a dungeon with a chest containing cotton seeds!
		The chest is at (-211,1284,-89), though.
		That elevation is prohibitively high.
		I&apos;d do it for blueberries, but for cotton seeds that I could more-reasonably find underground, I&apos;d rather not generate the islands up that high and obscure the view of the surface world in my maps.
	</p>
	<p>
		While writing about my attempt to find blueberries in the sky, I realised there was a much easier strategy I could use to rule out the possibility.
		The issue is that I knew they could generate in and out of the snow, but didn&apos;t know exactly where.
		I looked it up, and they specifically grow in grasslands and snowy grasslands.
		I noticed probably about a year ago that biomes are identical across map generators that support it.
		That is, the biome locations aren&apos;t determined  or even influenced by the map generator chosen, so long as you don&apos;t choose the <code>v6</code> generator (which uses a hard-coded set of biomes instead of the biome definitions provided by the subgame) or the <code>singlenode</code> generator (which generates no biomes and absolutely no terrain whatsoever).
		So today, I merged the elevation-specific biomes to form the twelve major biomes of the subgame, redefined them to generate only woolen structures of a biome-specific colour, and mapped out a world generated using this new biome code in the <code>flat</code> map generator.
		World&apos;s navel contains a bit of ice sheet and a bit of coniferous forest, but is actually mostly taiga.
		No biomes aside from these three are present.
		That means there is absolutely no chance of blueberries generating here, at any elevation, ever.
		Without the biome map, it&apos;d be hard to be sure, as much of World&apos;s Navel is ocean, so who even knows what biomes you&apos;d fine in the floating islands above, but the map makes it exceedingly clear that nothing&apos;s up there besides mushrooms and cotton seeds.
		Getting the mushrooms is vital, as none are available near ground level, but the seeds I know can be found underground, so there&apos;s nothing besides mushrooms to seek above the clouds.
		In retrospect, I should have taken into account where the brown mushroom was before building my home tower, but I was eager to have a place to call home at all.
		If I&apos;d put the tower in the right spot, I could have simply made it tall enough to reach the ledge of the cliff I need to get to to get the mushroom.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve set up menu assets for Mushroom Fork.
		The header is a crudely-drawn fork stuck into a mushroom with the regular Minetest Game logo above it.
		While the drawing certainly lacks artistic skill, I surprised myself with how well it came out.
		It&apos;s not the best, but it&apos;s actually presentable, and I actually rather like it.
		On the off chance that someone decided to submit a pull request with a better logo, I&apos;d almost definitely take it, but I&apos;m also not going to put any further work into the logo myself.
		I&apos;m satisfied with it as-is.
		The icon for the game is simply the same mushroom, without the fork.
		For the background, I used today&apos;s screenshot with the sky carefully deleted so the regular menu clouds scroll through.
		I still don&apos;t think Mushroom Fork sets itself apart enough for a release though.
		My current goal is to come up with something for stats to actually be good for.
		Once I have that, I think release is imminent.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my efforts to find ways of differentiating Mushroom Fork from Minetest Game proper, I came up with a new idea: mushroom alloys.
		Basically, you take one of each colour of mushroom ingot and craft it with one of the five ingots from Minetest Game.
		From this, you get mushroom steel, mushroom gold, mushroom tin, mushroom copper, or mushroom bronze, depending on which Minetest Game ingot you used.
		My initial intent was to use each of these five ingots in crafting one of five special chests, but now, I&apos;m thinking that maybe only some will be used for chests and some for other things.
		Hopefully, they will each serve multiple purposes in the future.
		In any case, this would tie back to the mushroom theme, making the name of the fork even more relevant.
		I want mushroom ingots to be a core part of the gameplay.
		Speaking of which, I think I&apos;m also going to make the mushroom ingots - though not the mushroom alloys - craftable into blocks.
		At first, I wanted to make these blocks take a couple dyes in the crafting recipe, so you could have 256 colours of each block, but decided against it.
		It wouldn&apos;t fit with the feel of the rest of Mushroom Fork&apos;s Minetest Game components.
		Likewise, I was going to put dyes in the chest recipes, but the normal chest-with-an-ingot recipe takes up every crafting slot, and replacing a couple of the wood nodes with dye wouldn&apos;t fit with the game very well.
		Anyway, I either need to come up with five new unique chests for Mushroom Game or I need to figure out what else these alloys could be used for.
