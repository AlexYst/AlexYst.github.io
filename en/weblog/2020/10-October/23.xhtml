	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I got to thinking today, and realised just how fortunate it is that I went out of my way to get my proctored courses out of the way before my other courses.
		At this point, I have no access to any proctors due to the pandemic causing the local university to shut down.
		If I was still dealing with proctored courses, I&apos;d have to put my schooling on hiatus.
		My school has a policy of only allowing a certain number of terms off too before you&apos;re simply dropped from the program and can&apos;t re-enrol.
		And with how unreasonable the school has been at every opportunity they get, I have no doubt that they&apos;d refuse to make an exception even given the global pandemic that&apos;s going on right now.
		My paranoia paid off once again.

		I spent my game time today re-mining the resources I lost yesterday when I didn&apos;t double-check my work.
		I didn&apos;t have much time for actual building after that.
		I did get one of the supports for my stone bridge fleshed out though.
		I should have several others completed tomorrow, most likely.

		I came up with a new system for making use of <code>liblevelup</code> levels.
		At best, it still needs work, and at worst, it&apos;s highly flawed.
		Still, with some refinement, I might be able to get something cool up and running.
		Basically, the idea is to set up a runic magic system.
		Each type of rune can be crafted by surrounding one of the element with eight stones in the crafting grid.
		This will give you eight of that particular rune, and things crafted from that rune will tend to be more useful when you&apos;ve got a higher proficiency in the related element.
		Each rune will have its own uses.
		For example, I want to create some sort of pocket chest by combining one or two runes with a regular chest.
		Before I release that, I want to have at least one special chest per rune though.
		I also want runic tools.
		You take the regular stone tool recipes and substitute in runes.
		The runes don&apos;t have to match, either, resulting in dynamically-defined tools that have a mix of abilities.
		My one hang-up on that is that I don&apos;t want runes that exist in finite quantities - such as the diamond rune, for example - to be used for tools.
		If I don&apos;t give them special tool abilities though, it might seem a bit inconsistent to other players who use the mod (id any).
		I suppose it could be the case that only some runes function for tools and only other runes function for certain other uses.
		Maybe I don&apos;t need to define 31 chests, one for each rune, for example.
		I&apos;ll have to think further on this though, as well as actually build the uses for the runes.
