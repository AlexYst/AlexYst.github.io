		Cyrus came with to help me move Summer&apos;s junk out of my home and into the storage unit along with our father today, so we got even more done this trip.
		Tomorrow, Cyrus won&apos;t make it, but our father and I are taking another load.

	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		My final exams kind of got put off for a couple days due to a combinations of factors, but mostly a combination of my lethargy and the fact that unexpected trips to the storage unit left me with less time than I&apos;d been expecting.
		Today, I finally got the exams taken, so I&apos;m done for the term.

		The short resource cycle is getting really old.
		As such, I started looking for ways to enlarge it, though without changing the cobble use ratio.
		in trying to figure out what to do, I started thinking about the idea of condensing cobble to make it more dense and last longer.
		I&apos;d pretty much need eleven stacks of cobble to get the tools where I want them to be.
		I thought about enlarging the crafting grid, but in all reality, I&apos;d just need to have a stack of furnaces in the recipe along with three stacks of cobble.
		That&apos;d do the trick.
		The more I thought on the situation though, the more I realised the cobble-condensation strategy won&apos;t work.
		A stone pick can mine sixty cobble, but it costs three cobble to make.
		Each cobble is therefore mining twenty cobble, one of which is used to replace itself as it wears out.
		Excluding the repair bonus, which does save a bit of material and minerals which cost me cobble but don&apos;t net me any, this means five percent of my cobble in just going toward pick repairs.
		Other tools don&apos;t even produce cobble as they work.
		Taking into account the wood needed too, some cobble goes toward that too, meaning there&apos;s even more cobble going toward gathering resources for tool repair.
		And of course, all that wood for tool repair adds up too.
		It&apos;s no wonder I&apos;m not really having fun any more.
		I&apos;m really not sure what a good solution would be, either.
		<code>mushroom_tools</code> puts too much emphasis on just those two mushroom elements and arguably the two spore elements.
		I don&apos;t like that.
		The <code>runes</code> mod is giving cobble it&apos;s fair share of tool emphasis, but the share it deserves based on the base subgame is so high that it&apos;s not even fun.
		That&apos;s not going to work.
		I need to spread out the load onto other renewable elements, though probably not taking all of the load off of cobble.
		It&apos;d be significantly more fun if cobble took less of the hit than it&apos;s supposed to.
		Oh.
		Yeah.
		Another issue is that I shouldn&apos;t really have required elements in the tools.
		If I do, I should require all of the renewable ones, but I can&apos;t even access most of them.
		Anyway, I&apos;m quitting the game for now to try to plan this out better.
		On some levels, it feels like my best option is to start fresh and build a subgame from the ground up.
		To do that, I need to first define a goal in that subgame though.
		<code>liblevelup</code>&apos;s concept isn&apos;t well adapted to the type of subgame I&apos;d build, so some other progress mechanic would be required in its place.
