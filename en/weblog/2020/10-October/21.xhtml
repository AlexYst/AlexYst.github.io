		Between yesterday and today, I put in a good deal of time mushroom farming, and I now have the four basic tools I need to get things done.
		With <code>mushroom_tools</code> installed, the game always starts out rather slow because it takes so long to get the tools, but progress becomes much faster once I&apos;ve got the tools I need in hand.
		Making things even better, I&apos;m not dealing with rivers and caves any more.
		The lack of rivers has made my island large enough that mushroom-farming went much quicker.
		The lack of caves is now making the digging of the mineshaft much more streamlined, so I made decent progress on that today.
		Without caves though, I&apos;ve found I&apos;m much more inclined to fill in the pockets I empty of valuable resources.
		Previously, I figured with so many ugly caves cutting through my mineshaft, the extra holes from mined resources didn&apos;t matter.
		Now though, it&apos;s costing most of the cobble I mine to fill in the holes as I go.
		It took me longer than expected to save up enough to deck out my furnace room.
		I guess that was a mild inconvenience, but overall, it means I don&apos;t have as much cobble to find uses for.
		At least for now.
		Once I&apos;ve reached my intended depth and start digging out the mine down there, I&apos;m going to be swimming in cobble as much as in previous iterations of the world.

		I thought had a bit of a break on that equation from yesterday.
		I thought I could use knowledge of what the average level needed to be set to to remove complexities in the equation.
		That won&apos;t work at all though.
		The issue is that I <strong>*don&apos;t*</strong> know what the average (<var>a</var>) needs to be.
		The obvious answer is that the average needs to be <var>t</var> / <var>n</var>.
		What I forgot to account for is that <var>t</var> is the level I&apos;m trying to measure progress toward as seen by the player, while <var>a</var> is the average of the internal, unscaled levels the player never sees.
		Knowing what the next visible level is for the player doesn&apos;t tell me anything directly about what their internal, unscaled level is.
		The scaling is too complex for that.
		The equation for the scaling is really simple though: you multiply each component of the level by the average of the components, then square root each product and add the square roots together.
		It really seems like there should be a way to reverse this process, and I almost certainly could do it if not for the fact that there are an unknown number of components that need to be included in the reversal.
		As I thought about the problem more though, I realised that my summation formula was incorrect.
		If I found a solution based on that summation, it&apos;d report how much a player would need to gain if they add an equal percentage to all stats instead of just one.
		I royally botched that expression, that&apos;s for sure.
		Due to the fact that one iterations of the summation needs to use a separate formula than the others, I&apos;m not sure how to mathematically express the problem.
