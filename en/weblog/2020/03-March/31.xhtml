<section id="distancing">
	<h2>Social distancing</h2>
	<p>
		I made a stop at the grocery store, only to find a long line outside.
		I could have asked what it was about, but I just sort of assumed the grocery store was only allowing a certain number of people in at once, so I just went to the back of it, and that did turn out to be the case.
		I wasn&apos;t sure I had time to wait, as I hadn&apos;t left the apartment early enough to stay long, and there was quite a line.
		Much to my surprise though, after enough people had left, they let us all in at once.
		That was odd.
		I figured as one person left, they&apos;d let one person in, but that&apos;s not how they wanted to run it.
		So we all crowded into the singular entry isle, trying to keep apart, but also trying to get through.
		A slow trickle of people would have been more effective than simply opening the floodgate for over a dozen people at once.

<section id="drugs">
	<h2>Drugging up</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the two returning shift leaders that were drugging up in the back actually <strong>*told*</strong> the other person we were working with that they were sending us home so they could drug up.
		Had they told me, I&apos;d never have left.
		But that employee told the night assistant manager, who then told me.
		They didn&apos;t tell me where they got their information, so I wasn&apos;t quite sure it was accurate, but now I&apos;m convinced.
		They admitted it themselves.
		Wow.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="corona">
	<h2>Corona virus</h2>
	<p>
		It seems the partner of one of my workmates now has the corona virus.
		They said it was an off-strain though, so maybe it&apos;s not as dangerous.
		In any case, they might have now brought it into the workplace to us.
		That&apos;d be ... something.
		And then we&apos;d end up spreading it to the customers before we get symptoms and knew we had it.
		I can&apos;t blame them, though.
		We&apos;re not really paid well enough to be able to survive taking time off work.
		I mean, I personally can, because I keep my bills lower than reasonably possible, so I&apos;ve saved up enough to live on for probably over a year if I had to.
		But the rest of us aren&apos;t so well-off.

	<p>
		I meant to get the <code>renew</code> mod&apos;s topic post written up yesterday, but I just wasn&apos;t feeling it.
		I guess I wasn&apos;t feeling it today either, but at least yesterday, I put in some effort on the <code>blockprotectnodes</code> mod, even if most of that effort ended up in vain, and I even wrote up the topic post for that mod and got the update released.
		I actually got something done yesterday.
		To get anything done today, I had to write up the <code>renew</code> mod&apos;s post.
		So now that&apos;s done.
		And that&apos;s the last of my old mods that needed to be updated.
		Now I can do something else.
		Now I can work on <code>alchemy2</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I want to change the base form of the iron/sand and coal/sand hybrids, as well as rename them.
		I also want some sort of string-naming convention for dealing with elemental nodes and elemental drops, but I think I have a decent idea of what I want to do there.
		Other than that, I&apos;m probably going to reuse a lot of my work from my last <code>alchemy2</code> attempt.
		There&apos;s nothing particularly <strong>*wrong*</strong> with it, and it&apos;ll serve as a good starting point.
