	<h2>Drugging up</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure if I wrote about it or not, but one of the returned shift leaders - the one that I mentioned has no actual authority over anything and is a shift leader in name only - asked to take one of my shifts a while back.
		They wanted the hours.
		I hate that toxic workplace, and I&apos;m no longer in debt.
		My number of bills is less than most people&apos;s too.
		I could afford not to show up for work that day, and it was when three of us - myself included - were overworked and not getting our breaks, so I figured I could use the rest.
		The other closer that night was the other new shift leader.
		They reported back later, and it turns out the pseudo shift leader had goofed around that night, and the already-exhausted new shift leader had to cover all of the stations themself.
		Lovely.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, they tried to take another of my shifts, so I pointed out what they&apos;d done, and declined.
		They denied it, but seeing how problematic they usually are, I&apos;m much more inclined to believe the responsible new shift leader that had been skipping breaks with us and even working off the clock to make things work.
		This time, if they took my shift, they&apos;d be closing with the other returning shift leader, and the two of them seem to get along well.
		So I left it up to the one who&apos;d be dealing with this troublemaker.
		They seemed happy about the shift switch, so I let it happen.
		I never heard anything negative about it, so I figured it might have gone okay.
	</p>
	<p>
		Last night, there were four of us closing.
		That&apos;s about what we need, but lately, we usually have the last two open hours with only two people because the franchise owner&apos;s been under-staffing us.
		I figured we&apos;d have the workers needed to get everything done easily, despite one of us being that returning slacker.
		Instead, the other returning shift leader sent the other employee home, then sent me home.
		I could have stayed, but I hate the place, and practically everything was done.
		There&apos;d only really be an issue if they got hit with one of the odd closing rushes that happen sometimes, which wouldn&apos;t be likely lately because everyone&apos;s afraid of this false plague.
		I also needed to walk home and change out my flat inner tube, so I could use the extra time.
		That they were happy to close with the slacker made me think that maybe they don&apos;t slack when they&apos;re with teh other returning shift leader.
		But no.
		I got a report from the night assistant manager now that they stayed an hour and a half past closing time cleaning everything up because they&apos;d spent the whole time drugging up in the back.
		They&apos;d sent us away not because we were so slow, but to get us out of their hair so they could drug up.
		Lovely.
		Honestly, I expected such behaviour from the slacker.
		I&apos;ve closed with them once before, and they did just that.
		I guess I&apos;d forgotten about it.
		I don&apos;t think I was a shift leader yet back then, and even if I was, I wasn&apos;t under nearly as much stress as I am these days.
		I honestly didn&apos;t mind running around and finishing everything myself while they literally laid on the back table, seemingly recovering from whatever it was that they were smoking.
		Marijuana, I&apos;m guessing.
		I didn&apos;t expect that of the other returning shift leader though.
		I swear.
		It feels like the store only has three responsible adults these days, and I&apos;m stuck being one of them.
		I told the night assistant manager I&apos;d keep an eye on that behaviour from them and not fall for it again.
		I&apos;m not sure to what extent I&apos;ll be thwarting their shenanigans.
		I know I won&apos;t be going home early myself when they&apos;re the ones trying to send me away or when they&apos;re the only management-types that&apos;d remain when I leave.
		The night assistant manager actually told me that if they try to send me home &quot;because it&apos;s slow&quot; or whatever, I&apos;m well within my power to tell them that one of them should go home instead.
		That&apos;d be hilarious.
		Split up their little drug party, unless they <strong>*both*</strong> leave and drug up <strong>*off*</strong> the clock.

	<h2>Telephone idiots</h2>
	<p>
		Today was another day of dealing with idiots on the telephone.
		Two in particular caught my attention more than the others.
		One of them called all energetic and asked to place an order for delivery.
		I explained, as I always do, that delivery orders have to be placed on the website, giving them the Web address, then saying we can&apos;t deliver via telephone.
		The immediately seemed to lose all their pep.
		Seemingly crestfallen, they replied in a sad voice, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;, and hung up.
		Seriously?
		It&apos;s not that bad.
		We weren&apos;t delivering before the on-the-website delivery order option, so they&apos;re not losing a delivery option they had before.
		When you call up a place for a new service you haven&apos;t used before, you should be prepared to not yet know their policies if you haven&apos;t done any research.
		And if they&apos;d researched, they&apos;d&apos;ve known we don&apos;t deliver via telephone, and wouldn&apos;t be <strong>*that*</strong> disappointed.
		At worst, they just continue doing whatever they were already doing without our delivered pizzas, such as coming in and picking them up or ordering from a different pizza place.
		If they have Internet service, which they may or may not, it&apos;s not difficult to order on the website and stop calling and keeping us from actually making orders that&apos;ve already been placed.
		I just don&apos;t see a reason to be overly sad about it.
		I mean, when I find out a company <strong>*only*</strong> offers service via telephone, I simply don&apos;t use that company&apos;s service.
		I don&apos;t start up a relationship with those companies, plain and simple.
		If you need a company that does offer services over the telephone, you can do the same thing, and accept that not all companies will, and simply not start up a relationship with a company when you find out that they don&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second noteworthy case was again someone calling to try to place a delivery order over the telephone.
		We don&apos;t offer that service.
		It wouldn&apos;t be practical for us at our location, though I&apos;m not convinced that&apos;s the reason corporate isn&apos;t trying to have us do it anyway.
		Anyway, I again told them that all delivery orders have to be placed on the website and I gave them the address.
		Their response?
		&quot;Is there an app for it?&quot;
		Um.
		What?
		An app for the website I just mentioned?
		No.
		That wouldn&apos;t make any sense.
		That&apos;s not how websites work, unless you&apos;re referring to the Web browser as being the app for that, which would technically be correct.
		I&apos;m not sure if they simply didn&apos;t ask what they meant or if they were honestly too stupid to even <strong>*know*</strong> what they meant, but if you&apos;re going to ask me stupid questions, you&apos;re not going to get the answers you want from me.
		I don&apos;t take too well to idiocy.
		For example, people have called the store asking if we carry &quot;boneless&quot; before.
		Not &quot;boneless wings&quot; or something, just &quot;boneless&quot;.
		Do you know what I tell these people?
		I tell them that <strong>*all*</strong> of our pizzas are boneless.
		We do have a mobile application.
		It&apos;s not an application for the website, but it&apos;s an application that allows you to place orders.
		But on top of not wanting to give people what they want if they&apos;re going to act like idiots, it&apos;s proprietary software, meaning that I can&apos;t in good conscience point it out to people, and I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s one of those creepy ones that tracks you around everywhere.
		I&apos;m not even sure if they didn&apos;t understand what the Web address I gave them meant and somehow thought the Web address was an application somehow.
		So I replied that you open up a Web browser on your computer, go to [insert address here], and place the order from there.
		I can&apos;t check, because the website is blocking me at the moment, but I&apos;m pretty sure advertisements for the mobile application was plastered all over that website last time I looked.
		I&apos;m not sure why people want to install those creepy things, but if they honestly wanted a mobile application rather than a website, they&apos;ll get their mobile application, and that&apos;ll be on them, not me.
		If I&apos;d&apos;ve told them to go get the app, that&apos;d be on me.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_4.0/y.st./weblog_map/2020/03/29.png" alt="Block-protection node recipes" class="framed-centred-image" width="857" height="746"/>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten the <code>liblevelup</code>, <code>minestats_hud</code>, and <code>minestats_sfinv</code> mod release threads updated.
		That just leaves the <code>blockprotectnodes</code> and <code>renew</code> threads.
		I came up with a last-minute feature I want to add to <code>blockprotectnodes</code> though.
		It has an optional inventory menu page it can add which explains the mod and gives players the crafting recipe for the node it defines.
		When I updated that inventory page, I set it to show the recipe using two violet dyes.
		I decided today that it&apos;d be a better idea to have it choose a random dye each time you switch to that page, and use two of that dye in the recipe display, also updating the colour of the result to match.
		Both dyes shown will be the same colour, and blueberries will never be chosen, so that&apos;s only fifteen options.
		The blueberries thing will sort of be a secret for people to discover if they read the code, while using two different dyes is a feature for both people that read the code and people that decide to experiment.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the help of the new feature, I got screenshots of the fifteen recipes, then edited them together to create a chart to post on the mod release topic page.
		Of course, we know that this is only a small fraction of the available recipes, but the people reading the mod description there won&apos;t necessarily think to try mixing dyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		On my break at work, I came up with a better design for these nodes.
		It&apos;s the exact same pattern, but it animates, slowly flashing in and out of visibility.
		And once I got home and started writing about that, I came up with another animated design, where instead of flashing, the broken line pattern simply cycles around the square, with each of the three layers moving independently and at the same speed.
		With them being different sizes, it means they&apos;re not in sync, and a number of frames equal to the lowest common denominator of the frame counts for each layer will be needed.
		I think I like that idea better.
		Ugh.
		Now I&apos;m going to need to draw that before releasing the mod.
		I thought I was done, and just needed to write up the topic post for it!
		This may not be a mod I use any more or even particularly care about, but don&apos;t let it be said that I&apos;ve abandoned it or that I don&apos;t put in the effort to implement what I think would make it cool to other people.
		At least, as long as it doesn&apos;t clash with the feel of the mod.
		For example, someone once asked for alternate shapes of the node, such as one that&apos;s wall-mounted instead of a full cube.
		It&apos;s possible - I could easily do it - but it doesn&apos;t fit the feel of the mod, so I legitimately think it&apos;d make the mod seem a bit messier and less directed.
