	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed I was gliding over a riverbank holding a stack of small, lit, green candles.
		They were too hot and burned my hands, and I ended up dropping most of them.
		The soft wax splatted on the rocks and sand.
		I also dropped some string I&apos;d been holding aw well.
		Once I touched down, I started gathering my dropped wax and string, not wanting to leave it where it might be harmful to the environment.
		Summer asked what I was doing, so I explained that I was gathering green wax and string, and she offered to give me some of her green candles, telling me I could melt them down for green wax.
		I thanked her, but also explained that I didn&apos;t actually need any wax, I just needed to clean up what I&apos;d dropped.
		She tried repeatedly to get me to use her candles for wax, and I explained the situation every time, but she just wasn&apos;t getting it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, as I gathered the warm wax, I found it was sticking to many things.
		It picked up a lot of sand, but it also got on some cats and dogs that went to investigate the stuff.
		Somehow, as I tried to get it off the cats and dogs, they ended up absorbing it all.
		There was no wax left, and the animals&apos; fur was stained green.
		Their fur wasn&apos;t even caked in wax or anything, it was just dark green in colour like the wax had been.
	</p>
	<p>
		Summer continued trying to get me to take her supplies, but finally got that I didn&apos;t need any wax.
		Somehow, she got into her head that I needed green beads though.
		She started cutting apart a lamp she had that had green beads on the outside.
		It was a nice lamp,but she ruined it, taking about a quarter of its beads to give me for the project she wasn&apos;t getting that I didn&apos;t have.
		When I wouldn&apos;t take the beads, again explaining that there was no project, she finally got it.
		She acted put off that I&apos;d let her cut apart her nice lamp for a nonexistent project though.
		It wasn&apos;t my fault.
		I tried explaining, but she wouldn&apos;t listen to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Summer actually acts like this in the real world, too, though not to such an exaggerated extent.
		She&apos;ll misunderstand a situation, refuse to listen to you when you try to correct her, try to help when you ask her to stop, then act put off that her completely unhelpful help is rejected on the grounds of being irrelevant to the situation at hand or - more often - outright counterproductive.
		It&apos;s so bad that I quit telling her about most situations back when I lived with her, because she&apos;d interpret anything I said as a request for help, and talking her out of it or explaining that I wasn&apos;t looking for help was usually impossible.
		It wasn&apos;t just me, either.
		My siblings noticed her tendencies as well.
		I remember one time one of them was telling her about their day, and she jumped in with unwanted advice that would have made the situation worse.
		When said advice wasn&apos;t taken, she got pissed off and seemed to be under the impression that they&apos;d asked for advice but then thought her advice wasn&apos;t good enough.
		Granted, the advice wasn&apos;t good enough, and all of us agreed it&apos;d make the situation worse right away.
		However, the advice was unsolicited.
		Nobody asked for help and the situation was under control.
		It was simply a story about what was going on in their life.
		A sort of friendly status report.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sometimes, she actually understands the situation perfectly, too, when it&apos;s simple enough.
		For example, she&apos;ll try to buy you something in front of your face.
		You&apos;ll tell her you don&apos;t want it, she&apos;ll get angry, and insist you take it anyway.
		You then won&apos;t use it, because you never wanted it, and she&apos;ll get angry that &quot;you wasted her money&quot;, and if you weren&apos;t going to use it, you shouldn&apos;t have had her get it for you.
		It&apos;s rather aggravating for everyone involved.
		Last time I remember he doing that to me, it was about a pillow in Coos Bay.
		She wanted to buy everyone a pillow.
		I told her I had about seven pillows, and didn&apos;t need another.
		She insisted, and when she holds power over you, there&apos;s no fighting back when she insists.
		So I left the pillow, still in its wrapping, in the closet.
		When we were moving back to Springfield, she noticed the pillow was still unused, and we had to thin down again for the trip, so she knew it was a bad idea to keep the pillow.
		And she got angry with me for having had her buy it for nothing.
		Seriously?
		I told her not to buy it, but she has a real no-means-yes mentality.
		How is this my fault?
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure why I&apos;m still dreaming about Summer when I haven&apos;t seen her in probably nearly a year now, and she&apos;s been avoiding me for probably a year and a half.
		When I do dream about her though, it&apos;s usually very clear what the dream is about, and it&apos;s usually something that gets me worked up to think about.
		I don&apos;t often have pleasant dreams about her unless my father is also involved in the dream, and I think that really says something.

<section id="flat">
	<h2>Flat tire</h2>
	<p>
		On the way to work, I noticed my tire was flinging rainwater in a sort of bizarre way.
		As it cycled, only one side of it seemed to be flinging much water.
		So I slowed down to try to understand what could possibly be going on with the shape of the tire to be causing that.
		As it turned out, I&apos;d punctured yet another inner tube, and this time, had left a big enough hole in both the inner tube and the tire itself to let the air escape rapidly enough to blow the water away on that side.
		I&apos;d run over a stick not too long prior, so that had probably been the cause.
		I&apos;ve never lost a tube that way before though, and I&apos;ve never had that big of a hole punctured in the tire itself before.
		So that was a new experience.
		The novelty of it sort of kept me from being all that annoyed, but I did end up having to walk most of the way to work, so I ended up a few minutes late.
		With how slow business is and how close to being on-time I was, no one really cared.
		I&apos;ll need to get the tube switched out tonight after work though.

	<p>
		I now have a texture sort of similar to something I tried to create in the past.
		At one point, I wanted the protection nodes to just look like stone, but have coloured glyphs pained on them.
		Instead of glyphs, this just has a dot and line pattern, but the basic idea is the same: a magic pattern is what&apos;s providing the protection.
		It makes sense, given that a couple dyes are needed to craft the node.
		With <code>blockprotectnodes</code> complete, I turned my attention to <code>minestats_hud</code> and <code>minestats_sfinv</code>, which I&apos;d saved for last on account of thinking them to be the easiest to update.
		Sure enough, all I needed to do was update the function names in the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> calls.
		Everything is now updated.
		I just need to write up my amended descriptions for all my released mods.
		All the code work is complete.
