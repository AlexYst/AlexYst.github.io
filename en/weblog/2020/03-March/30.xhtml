	<h2>Dream journal</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that the restaurant at which I work was a large, concrete building.
		Every hour, we had to move everything out, and the fire department, who was waiting outside, would spray our our whole building with a fire hose.
		People were so afraid of the corona virus that we were having to take extreme measures, but the franchise owner still wasn&apos;t shutting down the store.
	</p>

<section id="corona">
	<h2>Corona virus</h2>
	<p>
		Speaking of he corona virus, it seems it&apos;s more of a threat than I&apos;d originally been lead to believe.
		My new understanding is that the most dangerous thing about it is that it&apos;s new.
		As such, no one has an immunity to it yet.
		If you&apos;re exposed, you almost always catch it.
		There&apos;s about a one in ten chance that if you catch it, you need to be hospitalised.
		Those aren&apos;t the worse odds, but they&apos;re not good, especially when combined with the spread rate.
		And with such a high spread rate, the hospitals and other medical facilities can&apos;t keep up with the newfound demand for things such as respirators.
		Oh yeah, that&apos;s mainly what it attacks, too: your respiratory system.
		The hospitals could probably save nearly everyone, but the sudden demand has left them short on what they need to do it.
		So they can&apos;t.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other words, those who were panicking weren&apos;t as foolish as I&apos;d been led to believe.
		There actually is a threat here.
		As for me, I&apos;m too stressed out to be afraid.
		I think if I weren&apos;t constantly dealing with the school&apos;s garbage though, I would be.
		It sounds like they&apos;re going to unregister me from the current term again due to delays the virus scare has caused in the mail, so my tuition payment hasn&apos;t made it to them again, and if it doesn&apos;t make it by tomorrow, I&apos;m out of next term.
		For now.
		If it makes it before late registration, I&apos;ll probably be able to reregister, just not for the courses I&apos;m after.
		Still, progress will be progress, and if I&apos;m at least taking two courses, progress will be made.

		The former night manager had been complaining that we haven&apos;t taken social distancing measures at our workplace, and everywhere else seems to have been doing that lately.
		When I came to work tonight, I found a printed note taped to the door asking people to keep ten feet apart and to stay out of the lobby if there were four people in the lobby already.
		We now have pizza-patterned triangle stickers marking where people should stand, too, similar to the tape on the floor everywhere else.
		My guess is that the franchise owner did nothing as they don&apos;t care, but corporate, who probably also doesn&apos;t care, wants to look good in the eyes of the public and sent all the franchises these social distancing stickers.
		Probably putting the stickers on the tabs of the franchises, whether they wanted them or not.
		Whatever the case is though, our workplace is now engaging in social distancing as well.

	<h2>Drugged up</h2>
	<p>
		Yesterday, I mentioned the two returning shift leaders getting drugged up in the back.
		I also mentioned that it hit me by surprise that the one was doing that, but it didn&apos;t surprise me about the other.
		It seems though it&apos;s pretty well known that while the one used to be a responsible night assistant manager, when they lost the position due to having left the store, they returned without that same sense of responsibility they once had.
		I was just the last to know because I tend not to see people for the bad unless someone hits me upside the head with it.
		Without their title though, they don&apos;t seem to feel like they have to actually put in an effort.
		It&apos;s disappointing, but I guess that&apos;s how it goes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The former night assistant manager took another of my shifts earlier, and that shift is to be tomorrow.
		I wouldn&apos;t&apos;ve given up the shift if I&apos;d known they were just going to be slacking off and drugging up at work.
		I thought I might drop by and see if I was needed partway through the shift.
		But tonight, I was made aware that the other slacker&apos;s going to be &quot;working&quot; that night too.
		I&apos;m not leaving the other new shift leader to deal with that mess on their own.
		I decided I definitely have to come in for a full shift.
		The current night assistant manager was there as I wrote up the job board for tomorrow, and we discussed my coming in.
		So they&apos;re definitely in the loop and didn&apos;t put up any objections.
		They gave me some advice on how to deal with the two of them, and even said I could send the whole crew home aside from those two then up and leave myself, if they weren&apos;t doing their jobs, forcing them to run the entire store themselves.
		But isn&apos;t that what they want?
		That&apos;s why they sent me and the other crew member home early the other day.
		The assistant night manager also said that if I send everyone home because those two aren&apos;t working, they&apos;ll be dropping by to pick up the other new shift leader, as the two of them are a couple.
		And if they come to pick up their partner, they&apos;ll put on their work shirt, clock in, and fire those two.
		Then they&apos;ll work the rest of their shifts.
		Of course, that&apos;d leave them and their partner as the only two running the store, so I&apos;d stay behind just to provide more personpower once they got there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tonight didn&apos;t go so well.
		We were even more severely understaffed than usual, and had to stay an hour late to clean up, even with the night assistant manager dropping by to pick up their partner and helping us clean while they waited.
		I think I&apos;m going to keep what I know under wraps for now, only discussing it with the other two responsible adults of the store.
		When those two slackers see I&apos;m there even though they tried to get rid of me for today, I&apos;ll play it off and act like I&apos;m there to help them.
		Really, I&apos;m there to help the other new shift leader, as I don&apos;t think those two alone will be of much use in getting things done in a reasonable amount of time, even if we <strong>*weren&apos;t*</strong> still severely understaffed.

		I didn&apos;t have time to check out the cycles on those line patterns last night, but I checked them out today so I could figure out what size to make the animation texture.
		The first cycle is thirteen, a prime.
		The third is five, another prime.
		Ant the second is nine, a multiple of two of the same prime, neither of which is one of the other two primes.
		I just have to straight-up multiply these three numbers to get the number of frames I need.
		I need <strong>*five hundred eighty-five*</strong> frames.
		I&apos;m dedicated to making sure I don&apos;t just abandon the mod, but that&apos;s a ridiculous number of frames to draw.
		I&apos;m not <strong>*that*</strong> dedicated.
		Still, as simple as the concept is, it&apos;d be a really cool effect, and I wasn&apos;t about to give up, even if it&apos;s not a mod I plan to ever use myself again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Immediately, the plan changed from hand-drawing each frame to instead separating the three cycles, hand-drawing the frames of each cycle, them finding a way to merge them.
		Before I could even type up the plan, I&apos;d come up with a way, too: the <abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr>&apos;s pattern bucket fill option.
		After building the texture though, I tested it, and it just wasn&apos;t a very good-looking effect at such low resolution.
		It took over an hour to build the texture, and it just had to be scrapped in the end.
		I then built the simpler texture that fades in and out, and the game wouldn&apos;t display most of the frames at all.
		Minetest doesn&apos;t rally handle texture transparency well unless pixels are fully transparent or fully opaque.
		So that texture idea won&apos;t work for technical reasons.
		It&apos;s back to the original idea then.
		You can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t try though.
		Anyway, with my attempts to improve the mod failed, I released what I had.
		It&apos;s still a big improvement over the last release.
