	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Business picked up a bit from how it&apos;s been lately, but it&apos;s still down from normal because of the virus scare.
		With work this slow, even understaffed, we&apos;ve been able to keep up easily.
		However, it seems the owner has been watching the decreased demand too, and is going to be cutting our staff even further.
		Joy.
		To make matters worse, the head manager isn&apos;t on the schedule for the coming week.
		According to rumour, they&apos;ll be back mid-week, but there&apos;s no actual indication that this is the case.
	</p>
	<p>
		Near the end of the night, I noticed someone remotely logged into our computerised order system.
		I&apos;m not sure who they were or what they were doing, but they seemed to have their own account under a given name and last initial and were messing with the administrative functions.
		Probably someone from corporate.
		It&apos;s creepy, but we already know they watch us through the system they forced the franchise owner to buy against their will.
		And apparently, they can mess with stuff too.
	</p>
	<p>
		What I don&apos;t get though is why a remote login would share a visual with the local monitor.
		The computers at work run Windows.
		Maybe Windows is stupid enough that it can&apos;t handle a second set of visuals, but somehow, a stupid as Windows is, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the case.
		I&apos;m not familiar enough with Windows to say for sure.
		I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve done remote logins on some of my Debian machines in the past though, and they didn&apos;t mess with the the display of the machines&apos; local monitors.

	<p>
		I got got marram grass, permafrost, dry dirt, and kelp renewal programmed.
		That completes the <code>renew</code> mod.
		Next, I updated the dependencies of all my mods to be listed in the <code>mod.conf</code> files so I could delete the deprecated <code>depends.txt</code> files, and I took a look in the <code>blockprotectnodes</code> mod&apos;s directory.
		There, I noticed my old colour support file, which I&apos;d spent a lot of time programming, but had never released.
		I was never happy with VanessaE&apos;s Unified Dyes mod, on which that colour support depended.
		She make a lot of great mods, and the thoughts behind Unified Dyes are great, but I just don&apos;t like how that particular mod was executed.
		DuoDye support will be perfect for <code>blockprotectnodes</code> though.
	</p>
	<p>
		But then I noticed the file that implements the protection boundary display entity.
		Ugh.
		I forgot I even had that thing.
		Due to a total lack of modelling skill, I had to use an incredibly ugly hack to make that entity work out.
		I didn&apos;t even like the implementation originally, but it was the best I could do.
		And now, that implementation is in outright violation of my improved aesthetic, as it defines a node that is never intended to be placed in-word, but instead only used to set the appearance of an unrelated entity.
		It&apos;s utter garbage.
		At least now, I can stumble my way through Blender well enough to do it the right way, but it&apos;s inconvenient, and I&apos;m not really good enough at using Blender for it to be a particularly pleasant experience.
		And now I had to open up blender to fix up this mod I don&apos;t even really care about any more.
		I just don&apos;t want to be one of those developers that releases a bunch of mods only to abandon them.
		I try to release only when I think the mod is something I&apos;ll continue caring about, though I kind of missed the mark on some of these.
		Anyway, after a few hours of struggling, I think I managed to create the mesh I need.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also figured out a new recipe for the protection nodes that use flint, now that I&apos;ve become very aware of just how useless the material is.
		There aught to be <strong>*something*</strong> it&apos;s good for, so I&apos;ll be including it in a lot of my non-alchemic recipes whenever I need to define such recipes.
		I guess my next step is to figure out a more palette-friendly texture for the protection nodes.
