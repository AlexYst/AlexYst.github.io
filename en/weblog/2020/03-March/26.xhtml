	<h2><abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting called off</h2>
	<p>
		The <abbr title="Eugene Unix &amp; GNU/Linux User Group">EUGLUG</abbr> meeting was called off again today.
		I&apos;d actually assumed we weren&apos;t going to have it, but that no notification was going to be given and we were expected to just know because we&apos;d been called off last week.
		It&apos;s good to know our leader actually did plan to make sure we knew what was going on though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that I think about it, it might have been a good idea to call these meetings off.
		I think one of our leader&apos;s children is a bit weak, and I&apos;m not sure in all what ways.
		I know they&apos;re prone to seizures.
		They might have a compromised immune system too.
		I just don&apos;t know.
		And children in general are more at risk of complications from the corona virus anyway.
		Our members should be just fine if hit by the virus, but if they bring it home to their families, there could be problems.
		I think most people there are parents.
		Myself, I&apos;d take next to no risk by going.
		But for everyone else, it&apos;s probably a smarter idea to stay home.
		Calling off the meetings was the right move.

	<h2>Cracker sale</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;m pretty set for the time being on salad ingredients now, aside from the one that need to be bought fresh just before making a batch.
		As I mentioned before, I&apos;ve been eating things with the salad lately though, so today, my goal was to get crackers.
		I ended up getting mixed vegetable juice as well.
		I haven&apos;t been drinking it very often since I stopped keeping pretzels at home, but it usually makes me feel a lot better when I&apos;m starting to get sick.
		I figured it might be useful.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cracker prices were odd today.
		I could get the 225-gram box for $2.98 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> or the 425-gram box for $2.68 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>.
		Same brand, same flavour.
		I know buying in bulk is usually cheaper per unit, but for some reason, it&apos;s also cheaper per item at this store right now.

	<h2>Bottle redemption</h2>
	<p>
		With how out of it I&apos;ve been this term, I fell way behind in returning the redeemable bottles I gather at work for deposit.
		They&apos;ve been a real mess for me at home.
		Today and yesterday though, I finally got them cleared out.
	</p>
	<p>
		A big part of the problem is that I&apos;ve had to keep them in my locked bedroom, where I&apos;ve got to keep a lot of my stuff, so Summer doesn&apos;t take them.
		She does do that.
		Now that she&apos;s locked out though, I can put them back in my entryway where I used to keep them.
		There&apos;s a lot of stuff I won&apos;t have to squeeze into my bedroom now.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today at the redemption centre, I noticed one of the redemption machines&apos; monitors was damaged.
		It didn&apos;t come out in the photograph well, but it looks like someone slammed something against it.
		There&apos;s a decent-sized impact crack in the lower right corner, and the right-most part of the screen doesn&apos;t even display anything any more.
		Several columns of pixels hanging down from the top seem to be stuck on magenta too, which looks odd.
		I wonder what happened to this machine.

<section id="drudgery">
	<h2>Drudgery</h2>
	<p>
		I seemingly didn&apos;t have much to do today.
		I needed to take my final exams, write up my short learning journal entries on them, and finish up my journal entry for today.
		I took care of everything else yesterday.
		So I thought I&apos;d spend most of the day working on cleaning up Minetest mods.
		Not so much though.
		I&apos;d failed to realise that the next academic calendar is finally out.
		I&apos;m not sure when it was released, but I now know all the rest of the dates that are relevant to me.
		I&apos;m in the final stretch.
		So instead, I spent my time cleaning up my website files to reflect those dates.
		My list of planned canary updates is now good through y graduation, the dates for all my planned terms listed on my home page, and every file related to future learning journal entries is now correctly-dated.
		I&apos;ve gotten everything done in relation to my school-related pages as I possibly can at this point.
		The only thing they&apos;re missing is the actual coursework, which I have no way to get done ahead of time.
		Believe me, I tried to access the coursework early previously to get ahead, so I&apos;d have time for extracurriculars.
		It&apos;s simply not happening though.

		I&apos;ve finally paid off my string debt.
		Well, I guess that&apos;s a bad way to put it, as I had a string overstock; I didn&apos;t <strong>*owe*</strong> string.
		It&apos;s more that I owed cookables so I could get rid of the chests of string.
		But anyway, I&apos;ve got less than a stack left.
		I&apos;ve farmed enough mushrooms to burn all the full stacks of the stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been trying to figure out how I want to build the entrance to the Navel Underground.
		It&apos;d be really neat to have a big, wide tunnel with a narrow bridge, similar to the main roads, but slanting downwards.
		I can&apos;t for the life of me figure out how to do that though.
		I&apos;d need to slant the tunnel, but also slant the sides of the tunnel along a second axis.
		I don&apos;t think I quite have the nodes I need to pull it off.
		With some planning in the Eclectic Ruins, I might be able to figure something out.
		I kind of don&apos;t even want to bother though.
		The original plan was just a one-metre-wide path slanting downward, which I&apos;d add a rail to once I had the mese needed to do so.
		And now that I think about it, the large tunnel with a narrow bridge would be rather complicated not only for the regular stretches, but also because it&apos;d have to turn corners to keep within the boundaries of World&apos;s Navel.
		I&apos;m not really up for that sort of thing with my current skill level.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I was back to the plan of a one-metre-wide path, but I still didn&apos;t have an entrance planned.
		My original design was simple, but didn&apos;t allow the railway of the entrance to connect with the main road system.
		At this point, I want all rails to connect unless there&apos;s a good reason for them not to.
		I decided that maybe it&apos;d be better not to design an entrance down into the ground, but instead, build it into the side of a mountain.
		And for as long as I was planning to connect the rails, I was planning for the entrance to come right off the main road.
		So I need a mountain near the main road.
		From the looks of it, the main road will pass through three mountains, one of which is the central island of the world.
		It&apos;s got a natural tunnel cutting right through the side of it.
		I think that&apos;d be a good place to branch the tunnel and head downward.
		So you leave the main tunnel, then fork and head into a smaller tunnel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that I&apos;m writing about this, I started thinking about the consequences of choosing one of the other two mountains.
		I&apos;d likely need to put the fork in the tunnel itself, and I don&apos;t think that that&apos;d come out as nicely.
		The tunnel design just doesn&apos;t allow well for tiny tunnel offshoots.
