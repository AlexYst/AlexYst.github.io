	When <a href="/en/domains/thinkpad-x60s.local.xhtml"><code>thinkpad-x60s</code></a> started having cooling issues, this machine was gotten to take over.
	It had problems with not being able to properly wake from sleep sometimes, but was otherwise an excellent laptop.
	I purchased it from one of my former bosses back when it had Windows installed, but a little Debian installation media cleared up that problem.
	It&apos;s worth noting that this machine refused to boot the net installation media.
	Instead, to get Debian installed, the live Xfce version of Debian had to be used.
	Later, a live <abbr title="Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment">LXDE</abbr> version was used with equal effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
	For a time, newdawn operated as a server because <a href="/en/domains/chicken.local.xhtml"><code>chicken</code></a> had died and <a href="/en/domains/cepo.local.xhtml">cepo</a> had not yet been purchased.
</p>
<p>
	Eventually, after over two years, this machine gave out.
	It'd been freezing up on occasion, but one day, I found the power cord fused to the computer's plastic shell.
	I foolishly broke it loose, and that was the final straw.
	The machine would no longer charge after that.
	This machine was superseded by <a href="/en/domains/morgan.local.xhtml"><code>morgan</code></a>.
