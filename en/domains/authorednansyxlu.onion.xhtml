<p>When I originally set up my onion address, I was not yet taking onion addresses seriously. As I began to take them more seriously, I decided to transition to an address that was more readable. This onion address replaced <a href="/en/domains/quystystxtvdgyst.onion.xhtml"><code>quystystxtvdgyst.onion.</code></a>.</p>
<p>For a time, this onion domain was running from <a href="/en/domains/newdawn.local.xhtml"><code>newdawn</code></a>, my laptop, as I did not have a dedicated machine to use as a server. Later, this onion ran on <a href="/en/domains/cepo.local.xhtml"><code>cepo</code></a>. It once performed both client and server tasks, but this was found to be inefficient, so client tasks were moved to <a href="/en/domains/accessed574tizbu.onion.xhtml"><code>accessed574tizbu.onion.</code></a>, while server tasks remained on this onion. When I moved away from Coos Bay, <code>cepo</code> had to be taken offline, so this onion address went offline as well.</p>
