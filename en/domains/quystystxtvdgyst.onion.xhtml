<p>
	To learn more about how to use <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>, I set up an onion address, though it didn&apos;t see much use.
	A couple files were stashed on it, though nothing particularly secretive.
	There were just files that did not belong on my main website but still needed to be accessible.
	When I moved to Coos Bay, I found that my new <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> prohibited running servers from home, and I had to take down <a href="/en/domains/chicken.local.xhtml"><code>chicken</code></a>, the server the onion was running on.
	Though onion servers are technically clients and not true servers, chicken no longer had access to the Internet because it was no longer directly connected to the router and had no Wi-Fi card.
	Later still, I found that <abbr title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</abbr> had set aside the <code>onion.</code> <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> for use by <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> hidden services, making <code>quystystxtvdgyst.onion.</code> officially a legitimate domain.
	However, this domain doesn't see much use.
</p>
<p>
	<code>quystystxtvdgyst.onion.</code> ran on <a href="/en/domains/newdawn.local.xhtml">newdawn</a> for a period of fourteen days, but was taken down in favour of a more readable onion address: <a href="/en/domains/authorednansyxlu.onion.xhtml">authorednansyxlu.onion.</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Briefly, this onion was used to power <code>onioncat</code>.
	This lasted less than half an hour.
