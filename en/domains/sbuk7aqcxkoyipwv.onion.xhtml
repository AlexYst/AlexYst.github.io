<p>While setting up TorChat, I accidentally generated and activated this onion address. Had I considered the fact that TorChat might automatically do this without being asked to, I would have turned off my network connection until the process was complete. I assumed that TorChat leveraged your existing onion address already present in your <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> and that TorChat had some setup dialogs. However, TorChat is built to be easier to use than that and seems to start another Tor instance to make sure you have an onion available for chatting through. After patching some things together, I shut down this onion in favor of using my own.</p>
<p>I now know that by default, the Debian packaged version of TorChat generates a hidden service directory at <code>~/.torchat/Tor/hidden_service/</code>.</p>
<p>For a period, this onion address was being used to help <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users reach services that maliciously discriminate against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users. It also worked to provide a gateway to services that don&apos;t necessarily discriminate against <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> users, but that use a different darknet. However, when I moved away from Coos Bay, I had to take my server, <a href="/en/domains/cepo.local"><code>cepo</code></a>, offline. When that happened, this onion address went offline as well.</p>
