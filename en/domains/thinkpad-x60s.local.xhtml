	This old <a href="http://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a> machine was once my go-to laptop. It was a bit slow in some situations, but it really was a fine machine. Unfortunately, it started having issues overheating when the fan quit working properly.
	I held onto this machine in hopes that I could figure out how to repair it one day, but it had to be replaced with <a href="/en/domains/dewdawn.local.xhtml">newdawn</a> as far as usage.
	I tried replacing the fan, but that didn&apos;t work and the machine was still unusable.
	Eventually, I disassembled the machine for parts.
