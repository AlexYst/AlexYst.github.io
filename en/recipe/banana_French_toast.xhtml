<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		1 banana
	</li>
	<li>
		40 grams soy milk
	</li>
	<li>
		20 grams maple syrup
	</li>
	<li>
		0.5 millilitres ground cinnamon
	</li>
	<li>
		4 slices of whole wheat bread
	</li>
	<li>
		Enough vegetable oil to grease a frying pan with
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
	Blend everything aside from the oil and the bread in a blender.
	Pour the mixture into a flat dish, and soak the bread in the mixture, flip the bread over, then soak it for another minute.
	Grease the pan, and cook each slice of bread on it for about three minutes.
</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
	This is a modified version of a recipe given to me by my dietitian.
	The dietitian&apos;s version made twice as much mix though, which resulted in a lot of extra mix when you&apos;re done, given that their version still called for only four slices of bread as well.
	I also initially tried cooking this without the oil.
	I don&apos;t like cooking with oil, and find most things seem to turn out more to my tastes if I just leave it out.
	You really need the oil though, or the mix burns onto the pan really badly and won&apos;t come off very well, even if it&apos;s a non-stick pan.
