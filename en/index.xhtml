<h2><abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate update</h2>
<p>
	StartCom is closing down.
	With no other viable gratis certificate authority as far as I know, I&apos;m going to have to go back to using slef-signed certificates soon.
	If you&apos;re using a Web browser that blocks StartCom certificates, you&apos;ll soon be able to reach this website again.
	Not that you could be reading this now though.
	If you&apos;re using a Web browser that treats StartCom certificates properly, you&apos;ll notice a new warning show up, but you should still be able to visit the website.
	Otherwise, you should see no change.
</p>
<h2>Redaction</h2>
<p>
	My school has requested that I remove my coursework submissions from this website.
	I have done as requested, and in addition, have removed any unnecessary references to the school itself.
	Vague mentions such as &quot;in class, we studied {X}&quot; references remain intact, but unnecessary specification of which school I even attend have been corrected.
	What school I attend is still no secret though, and can be found on any of the multitude of take-down notice pages that have replaced pages that previously contained coursework submissions.
	Hopefully the school will be satisfied by this level of redaction.
</p>
<h2><abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate issues</h2>
<p>
	If your Web browser loads this page, thank your browser vendor for not being a total moron.
</p>
<p>
	This website uses a certificate issued by StartCom Ltd.
	The certificate &quot;authority&quot; system is broken though.
	Having root certificates that are magically considered to be &quot;trusted&quot; is a stupid and flawed way of doing things.
	StartCom broke the trust placed in them, and that trust was revoked by Mozilla and crew.
	Now, Mozilla-based Web browsers are refusing to load this website.
	If a certificate is &quot;untrusted&quot;, Mozilla-based browsers usually give the user the option to load the page anyway, but for certificates issued by StartCom, Mozilla isn&apos;t allowing this.
	<em><strong>This is a clear antifeature in Mozilla-based browsers and not a bug in this website.</strong></em>
	The problem isn&apos;t on the server end, but the browser end, so I can&apos;t fix it.
</p>
<p>
	However, if you want me to swap out my certificate for one your Web browser would play nicer with, I&apos;m more than willing to do that.
	However, there&apos;s a catch.
	I don&apos;t have the funds to splurge on a paid certificate.
	Likewise, I don&apos;t have the time to change out my certificate every couple months.
	If you want me to switch certificates, you&apos;ll need to point me in the direction of a certificate provider that offers gratis certificates that last at least a year before expiring.
	As of yet, the only such provider I&apos;ve located is StartCom.
	If you&apos;ve found another, please reach me via any method listed on my contact page, linked to above.
</p>
<h2>Canary update schedule</h2>
<p>
	I used to try to update my <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> daily, but I have too much on my plate to make that feasible.
	During busy periods, I&apos;m now updating once each week on Wednesdays.
	During slower periods, I&apos;m resting a bit and not updating the canary at all.
	Don&apos;t be alarmed if a scheduled update is missed, there are reasons this might happen.
	However, if the canary doesn&apos;t chirp in over a month, something is definitely wrong.
	(Though unlikely, the &quot;something wrong&quot; might be as minor as a technical error.)
	Currently, the predicted canary update schedule is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		2017-11-22
	</li>
