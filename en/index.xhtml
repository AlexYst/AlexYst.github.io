</ol>
<h2>Mormonism</h2>
<p>
	Some Mormon missionaries have been visiting me lately, so I&apos;m taking a look at religion.
	My current project is to <a href="/en/religion/scripture/Mormon.xhtml">read and analyse the Book of Mormon</a>.
	My goal is to complete one book from the Book of Mormon each week.
	I&apos;ll have to read through the Book of Mormon twice, once to catch the general themes and a second time to find all the things I missed about those themes from points before those themes became obvious.
	So far, I&apos;m finding it to be an interesting project, though it is taking quite a lot of time out of my day.
</p>
<p>
	My reading schedule has been completely derailed by a number of factors.
	First, I stretched myself too thin and needed to slow down.
	Next, I was told I need to pray twice about each chapter, slowing down the process of reading through the book.
	And third, I&apos;ve now been asked to set aside my Book of Mormon reading for some bible time.
	So yeah, I pretty much have no schedule as to when I&apos;ll have this book read by any more.
</p>
<h2><abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate update</h2>
<p>
	I&apos;ve been evicted from Opal&apos;s server.
	For now, this website is now on GitHub&apos;s server.
	That means that I can&apos;t control the <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate, due to the way GitHub&apos;s hosting operates.
	Furthermore, GitHub&apos;s certificate doesn&apos;t match the host name of this website.
	That means that there is necessarily a certificate mismatch here.
	Even if GitHub allowed the use of custom certificates though ...
</p>
<p>
	StartCom is closing down.
	With no other viable gratis certificate authority as far as I know, I would have to go back to using self-signed certificates soon.
	There does not seem to be a viable way for me to keep the website running on my budget and still avoid <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> certificate errors.
	A certificate mismatch warning doesn&apos;t look any scarier in a Web browser than a self-signed certificate warning, so there&apos;s really no reason for me to even bother looking for a solution to the GitHub certificate issue for the time being.
</p>
<p>
	I can&apos;t say GitHub is one of my Git hosts of choice or anything, but their website hosting made moving away from Opal&apos;s place quick and easy.
	I&apos;m open to other ideas (no dependencies on individual persons, please), but this seems like the best option until I have time to look into getting a <abbr title="virtual private server">VPS</abbr>.
	With a <abbr title="virtual private server">VPS</abbr> rented, I should be able to host more than just my website; I should have the clearnet entrance to my tiny <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> network back, as well as (once I have time to set it up) a Minetest server.
	For security reasons, I can&apos;t get the onion address back up on a <abbr title="virtual private server">VPS</abbr> (hosting on hardware you don&apos;t control should be considered insecure, so I can&apos;t risk my onion keys being jacked by the hosting provider), but connecting to the network from <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> exit nodes will be allowed.
	(Even if I had the onion address working, connecting over the clearnet from <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> exit nodes would be allowed; after all, I&apos;m not a monster.)
</p>
<h2>Redaction</h2>
<p>
	My school has requested that I remove my coursework submissions from this website.
	I have done as requested, and in addition, have removed any unnecessary references to the school itself.
	Vague mentions such as &quot;in class, we studied {X}&quot; references remain intact, but unnecessary specification of which school I even attend have been corrected.
	What school I attend is still no secret though, and can be found on any of the multitude of take-down notice pages that have replaced pages previously containing coursework submissions.
	Hopefully the school will be satisfied by this level of redaction.
	So far, 676 pages of this website have been completely redacted in compliance with the school&apos;s demand.
</p>
<p>
	According to the school&apos;s policy, the coursework archive can go live again two calendar years after my final term here.
	If everything goes according to plan, <del>I&apos;ll graduate mid-2020</del> <ins>my final term will be some time in 2021</ins>, meaning the archive can and will go live again on <del><time>2023-01-01</time></del> <ins><time>2024-01-01</time></ins>.
	<mark>As of last website update, that&apos;ll be in <del>1340</del> <ins>1705</ins> days.</mark>
	That&apos;s right: we even have an automated countdown for the event!
	I can&apos;t predict what my normal update schedule will be at that time, but I&apos;ll likely throw in a special update on that day just to reopen the archive and present new things that will have been literally waiting years to be released.
</p>
<p>
	<ins>Plans have changed, and I&apos;m going to try to take some unnecessary courses.
	If I succeed in getting those courses, it&apos;ll add two terms, pushing me into a new calendar year, thus adding another year to the censorship duration.
	The relevant changes are marked above, but being unsure if I&apos;ll be able to take said extra courses, the added censorship time is not set in stone.</ins>
</p>
<h2>Canary update schedule</h2>
<p>
	I used to try to update my <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a> daily, but I have too much on my plate to make that feasible.
	During busy periods, I&apos;m now updating once each week on Wednesdays.
	During slower periods, I&apos;m resting a bit and not updating the canary at all.
	Just before my break periods, my canary chirp will be delayed by one day, falling instead on a Thursday.
	Don&apos;t be alarmed if a scheduled update is missed, there are reasons this might happen.
	However, if the canary doesn&apos;t chirp in over a month, something is definitely wrong.
	(Though unlikely, the &quot;something wrong&quot; might be as minor as a technical error.)
	Currently, the predicted canary update schedule is as follows:
