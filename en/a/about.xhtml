<p>
	Hello! My name is Alex Yst (pronounced &quot;ist&quot; like the end of the word &quot;catal<strong>yst</strong>&quot;), and this is my home on the Web.
	I&apos;m a bit too busy to get everything done on this website as I&apos;d like to, so please bear with me.
	Development here is very slow.
	This website is going in <strong>no particular direction</strong>, and simply contains whatever I happen to want to make available on the Web.
</p>
<p>
	As for myself, I&apos;m a computer science student.
	However, due to threats from the school and accompanying censorship demands, you won&apos;t hear much about my studies until 2023-01-01.
	I&apos;m very much a supporter of free software and free culture, and believe the two to be highly intertwined.
	I don&apos;t settle for garbage licenses such as the <abbr title="GNU &quot;Free&quot; Documentation License">GFDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial">CC BY-NC</abbr>, or <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives">CC BY-ND</abbr>, regardless of the nature of the item being licensed.
	I used to be a supporter of the <abbr title="Free Software Foundation">FSF</abbr> until I learned that they actively promote the use on nonfree licensing, especially for non-software works based on opinion.
	I use Debian on my laptop and server, and Replicant on my mobile device.
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;m an agendered phallosexual; that means I don&apos;t feel masculine or feminine, and I can pair with someone of any gender as long as they have working male reproductive organs.
	If you don&apos;t know the difference between sex and gender, that statement might not make much sense to you; sex is a description of what&apos;s between your legs, while gender is a description of what&apos;s in your mind.
	Many people don&apos;t know what the words &quot;agendered&quot; or &quot;phallosexual&quot; mean, so I tend to mis-identify as a gay male for simplicity, ignoring gender altogether.
	I&apos;m a bit sensitive about my sexuality though.
	I feel shallow for not being able to pair with someone regardless of their sex organs, but humans are animals; we have instinctual needs that we can&apos;t override.
	We don&apos;t pick our sexualities.
	I&apos;m looking for a monogamous love interest, but I&apos;m currently single.
</p>
<p>
	If you&apos;re visiting my website, please check on my <a href="/a/canary.txt">canary</a>.
	It acts as a safety mechanism to know if I have been legally required to withhold information.
	If my canary hasn&apos;t chirped in a while, <strong>*please*</strong> alert anyone you feel is relevant to the fact that I need help.
	My <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> key <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is <code>0xE7464A03</code> and my <abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr> fingerprint is <code>D135 B061 DBED 690B 479F E2E3 7D83 E1E5 E746 4A03</code>.
