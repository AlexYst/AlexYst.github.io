	This page is just a way for me to keep my goals organised for the time being.

<section id="typing">
	<h2>Learn to type properly</h2>
	<p class="goal-attributes">
		<span>
			<span class="goal-attribute-high">

	</p>
	<p class="goal-ppstreq">
		Postrequisites: <a href="#good_job">#good_job</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is pretty self-explanatory.
		I need to learn to actually type properly.
		I never learned how in school, and it&apos;s about time I fix this.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve labelled this as high urgency because other high-urgency goals depend on my having completed this.
		I&apos;ve labelled it as high priority because other high-priority goals depend on it.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="associate">
	<h2>Finish my associate degree</h2>
	<p class="goal-attributes">

	<p class="goal-ppstreq">
		Postrequisites: <a href="#bachelor">#bachelor</a>, <a href="#good_job">#good_job</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		I need to finish my associate degree.
		For a number of reasons, this cannot be put off.
		I&apos;m only a term away from completing this goal though.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="bachelor">
	<h2>Finish my bachelor degree</h2>
	<p class="goal-attributes">

	</p>
	<p class="goal-ppstreq">
		Postrequisites: <a href="#martial">#martial</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		For a number of reasons, this cannot be put off.
		Not least of those reasons is that the completion of this degree marks the beginning of the countdown after which the school&apos;s censorship of my website ends.

<section id="new_job">
	<h2>Get a new job</h2>
	<p class="goal-attributes">

	<p class="goal-ppstreq">

	</p>
	<p>
		My current work environment is toxic and I need to escape.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, people are resistant to change.
		Even the people I&apos;ve asked to refer to me as a &quot;they&quot; refuse.
		In a brand new environment, I feel I would be more comfortable insisting and, as people wouldn&apos;t already be used to thinking of me as a man, people would be less resistant to accepting the fact that I&apos;m not one.
	</p>

<section id="good_job">
	<h2>Get a good job</h2>

	</p>
	<p class="goal-ppstreq">

	</p>
	<p>
		I want to not only escape my current, toxic work environment, but also move to a work environment in which I can actually stand behind what I do and enjoy it.
		I&apos;ve got to finish learning to type before I can qualify for such a job though, and with how long that&apos;ll take me, I&apos;ll probably have my associate degree completed.

<section id="hair">

	<p class="goal-ppstreq">
		Postrequisites: <a href="#voice">#voice</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Even right after I shave my face, the dark roots of my hair show through my skin.
		Shaving therefore doesn&apos;t even fix the facial hair problem fully even on a temporary basis.
		And then, it doesn&apos;t take long for it to grow back out.
		I need to look into something that will remove the hair at a deeper and likely permanent level.
		I wouldn&apos;t mind a permanent solution to arm, leg, and especially chest hair as well.
	</p>

		I&apos;m really fat.
		That has to end.
		I don&apos;t need to be super thin or muscly, but I should be able to see my toes when I look straight down.

	</p>
	<p>
		My voice is too masculine.
		I&apos;d like to get lessons to feminise it.
		I don&apos;t think I want to go through full feminisation through hormones and such, but having a sifter voice shouldn&apos;t be too much to ask.
		However, If I can&apos;t be bothered to get in better shape, I shouldn&apos;t be trying to skip to voice lessons.
		Furthermore, a feminine voice isn&apos;t going to help me pull off an androgynous air if I haven&apos;t already dealt with my massive gut and my facial hair problem.

<section id="IRA">
	<h2>Deal with <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> paperwork</h2>

		The head manager at work gave me paperwork relating to the company&apos;s new <abbr title="individual retirement account">IRA</abbr> provider.
		I need to actually deal with the paperwork soon to be sure there aren&apos;t further problems I need the person in charge to correct.

		My current laptop stopped freezing on me, so my fear that it&apos;s going to give up the ghost soon has subsided.
		However, when it does finally die, I&apos;ll need to have already set up a home Internet connection to continue my coursework.
		My current laptop is using Wi-Fi with a <abbr title="media access control">MAC</abbr> address whitelist, and the new machine has no way to get onto that whitelist.
		Additionally, having a home Internet connection will allow me to run a Minetest server and Web server.
		Palette Game has postponed the opening of my Minetest server by quite a bit though, as I need to now get the game into a usable state before opening the world to the public instead of just using the pre-built Minetest Game with a few extra mods.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Minetest">
	<h2>Complete Palette Game</h2>
	<p class="goal-attributes">

	<p>
		I started building a test page that would demonstrate how my website&apos;s <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> causes all valid <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> elements to render, but didn&apos;t have time to finish it.
		Having it done would help me notice bugs in the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.

<section id="sanity">

<section id="variables">

	<p class="goal-prereq">

	</p>
	<p class="goal-ppstreq">

	</p>
	<p>
		To avoid variables getting overwritten by files in ways other files don&apos;t expect and to avoid unexpected values in variables files don&apos;t expect to be set yet, all variables are supposed to be set or reserved in one file of this website&apos;s build scripts.
		At some point, I should build code that enforces that.

	<p>
		I haven&apos;t been on my own Web server in ages, and as such, have been unable to use proper <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> redirects.
		Until I&apos;m back on my own server, I should have JavaScript redirects set up to deal with cases where people either access the site without <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> or access the site using the wrong host name.

	<p>
		I&apos;ve been meaning to add code to make sure all used exceptions get thrown and caught to the testing suite I use to debug <code>include.d</code>.
		It&apos;d enforce that all error states actually be reachable.
		If it can never be reached, what is even the point of an error state?

	<p>
		I&apos;ve wanted to learn a martial art for a while now.
		Martial arts training is supposed to help with discipline and fitness, both of which I need more of.
		It wouldn&apos;t be bed having a way to defend myself either in the unlikely even that I&apos;m ever attacked.
		With no way to get terms ahead in my coursework during slow periods, there&apos;s no way I can be sure  can dedicate time to martial arts training during busy periods.
		I&apos;ll need to complete my schooling before I even begin martial arts training.
