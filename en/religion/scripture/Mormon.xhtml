			<h1>The Book of Mormon</h1>
			<p>An account written by the hand of Mormon, upon plates taken from the plates of Nephi.</p>
		</header>
<p>
	Wikisource seems to think the <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon_%281981%29">1981 edition of the Book of Mormon</a> is in the public domain on account of being published before 1924.
	Read that over for a bit.
	Yeah, that doesn&apos;t make any sense to me, either.
	The copy on Wikisource seems to lack some of the material that was added in the 1981 edition though, and even the chapter summaries from the 1920 edition, so it&apos;s likely that the only text included is in fact that old.
	That begs the question of why it&apos;s labelled as the 1981 edition though; the 1920 addition had the chapter and verse numbers, so it&apos;s not that.
	In any case, I trust Wikisource knows what they&apos;re talking about, so I&apos;ll be quoting passages from that version of the Book of Mormon.
	It is also my understanding that the only changes this edition made to the verses were to <a href="https://emp.byui.edu/SATTERFIELDB/Papers/BMPublicationHistory.htm">correct errors in the copy given to the printer</a>, meaning that this version of the verses likely existed at the time of the 1920 edition, but the copy given to the printer just wasn&apos;t quite right.
	I do not intend to commit copyright infringement.
	If you know this version of the verses to be in fact copyrighted, please let me know and I will make the adjustments (that is, I&apos;ll find the corresponding verse in an older version and use that instead).
	I don&apos;t know how to track down information on the copyrights, and I couldn&apos;t find the 1920 edition of the book that I intended to use.
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, without further ado ...

<section id="consistency">
	<h2>Inconsistency between the holy word and the beliefs</h2>
	<p>
		Some of what the Mormons believe directly contradicts what their holy book actually tells them.
		I&apos;m not sure where they&apos;re getting information on what to believe if not the holy book, and if their other source is somehow better, and clearly contradicts the book, why do they put any faith in the book at all? If the book isn&apos;t reliable, it isn&apos;t reliable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Examples of this will be in their own sections.
		A couple of these inconsistencies are brought up in <a href="#possible">#possible</a> and <a href="#hell">#hell</a>.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Jehovah">
	<h2>Jehovah&apos;s name</h2>
	<p>
		Many Christians don&apos;t even know their god has a name.
		They think he&apos;s just called &quot;god&quot;.
		That&apos;s like when you have a cat and you sometimes call it &quot;cat&quot; instead of its actual name.
		It&apos;s fine to do that, but &quot;cat&quot; was never its name.
		The same goes for the Christian god.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Christian god has many names, the two most common being Yahweh and Jehovah.
		In the Book of Mormon, the Christian god usually isn&apos;t mentioned by name, but finally, we learn his name in the second book of Nephi:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>2 Nephi 22:2</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also has become my salvation. 
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		With that in mind, seeing as I tend to call people by their actual names (except in my journal, where I leave out the names for the privacy of the people in my life), I&apos;ll frequently make mention of Jehovah by that name throughout the rest of this page.
		I only bring this up for people that don&apos;t actually know the name Jehovah, so you&apos;ll know who I&apos;m even talking about.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="witnesses">
	<h2>The witnesses</h2>
	<p>
		There were supposedly eleven witnesses to the existence of the golden plates, aside from Joseph Smith himself - the author of the Book of Mormon and supposed translator of said plates.
		If you were to start up a religion, or even an offshoot of a religion, you too would gather witnesses to make your religion seem valid.
		You might bribe these witnesses with any number of things, such as seats of power within your church.
		Claiming there are witnesses, and those witnesses bearing testimony, doesn&apos;t say much when you&apos;re hiding the evidence from the rest of the world.
		By not producing the plates for the world to see, Smith made it very difficult to believe such plates ever existed.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s also worth noting that five of these witnesses are from the Whitmer family and three are from Joseph Smiths&apos;s own family.
		One is even Smith&apos;s father.
		His own family is going to be biased, obviously, and the number of Whitmers makes me wonder if the Whitmer family and the Smith family have close ties as well.
		Aside from people from these two families, there are only three other supposed witnesses.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="conceited">
	<h2>Conceited</h2>
	<p>
		We see throughout the book that Jahovah is quite conceited.
		For our first example, take a look as early as 1 Nephi 1:8.
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 1:8</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God. 
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		Jehovah has some of his angels surrounding him just singing his praise.
		Seriously?
		If you were some great and powerful being, would you need someone there bolstering your ego, or would you just know how great you were?
		The missionaries I spoke with tell me they think Jehovah didn&apos;t tell the angels to do that, but instead, they just do that out of gratitude for all he&apos;s done for them and us.
		But again, if you&apos;re not highly egotistical, that sort of thing is going to get really old, really fast.
		If he wasn&apos;t egotistical, he&apos;d probably tell them to knock it off.
		Also, if the angels weren&apos;t either mindless drones or under orders, singing praises is going to get old for them too.
		They&apos;re going to want to stop.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="possible">
	<h2>Is it possible to follow his orders?</h2>
	<p>
		This is what Nephi had to say about the ability to follow commandments given by Jehovah:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 3:7</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father:
				I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		Put simply, if Jehovah commands you to do something, he&apos;s first cleared the path to the goal enough that following his order is possible.
		I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s necessarily <strong>*easy*</strong>, but if he tells you to do it, you can do it.
		And another example:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 17:50</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And I said unto them:
				If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them.
				If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		No mater what Jehovah tells you to do, if he tells you to do it, you can definitely do it.
		No exceptions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Compare that to the Mormon belief that Adam and Eve were given conflicting commandments.
		They were told both to reproduce and to not eat the forbidden fruit.
		The Mormons believe that Adam and Eve were unable to learn how to reproduce without eating the fruit, so the only way they could follow part of their orders was to disobey the other part.
		The Mormons believe Adam and Eve were unable to follow their orders completely, and had to choose which part of the instructions they were going to break.
	</p>
	<p>
		And here, we see that general theme again:
	</p>
	<div class="cited quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 17:3</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled.
				And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness. 
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		This time, we&apos;re told that if you keep the commandments, you&apos;ll be able to do as Jehovah instructs you.
		I guess that specific passage is a bit circular in logic though.
		If you do what you&apos;re told, you&apos;ll be given the strength needed to do what you&apos;re told.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="straw_man">
	<h2>Straw man</h2>
	<p>
		It seems to me like the Book of Mormon is trying to show that non-believers are wrong not to believe, by making even those that see evidence in the book not believe.
		Even with evidence, these people turn away from the lord, their god.
		This doesn&apos;t match reality.
		People that don&apos;t follow Jehovah tend not to believe in him because there&apos;s a severe <strong>*lack*</strong> of evidence.
		There&apos;s no valid reason for us to believe, so we don&apos;t.
		Take for example the following passage:
	</p>
	<div id="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 3:29 = 3:31</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying:
				Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod?
				Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities?
				Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.
			</p>
			<p>
				And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.
			</p>
			<p>
				And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying:
				How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us? 
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		Here, Laman and Lemuel are hitting Nephi with a rod because Nephi is trying to get them to stay with him and complete their seemingly-impossible mission, assigned to them by Jehovah.
		At this point, Laman and Lemuel have not seen evidence of Jehovah, so they can&apos;t be blamed for not believing, though they really shouldn&apos;t be hitting their younger sibling over it.
		An angel shows up, telling them to knock it off, and explaining that the lord will ensure the one person standing in the way of their goal will be taken care of.
		An angel stands before them and they&apos;re doubting that a deity can take out one measly human?
		I mean, granted, this human is strong, skilled, and commands an army, but versus a deity, what match are they?
	</p>
	<p>
		I think most atheists would agree that seeing an actual angel would be evidence enough of Jehovah&apos;s existence, and we wouldn&apos;t doubt his power.
		I mean, we might doubt that he&apos;s all-powerful, but we&apos;d know he has enough power to take out one individual.
		I mean, he did create the cosmos, after all.
		This theme of disbelief in the face of evidence is continued later, too.
		The whole point of atheism is that there <strong>*isn&apos;t*</strong> evidence.
		If there was, we wouldn&apos;t be atheists any more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later, these two rebel against the orders of Jehovah again, somehow forgetting he&apos;s got a plan and everything&apos;s going to be fine if they just do as they&apos;re told.
		So, Nephi has to step in and tell them off, reminding them Jehovah&apos;s real and got stuff cooking.
		As Nephi asked:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 7:10</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the Lord?
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		Even being reminded, these two elder siblings of Nephi remain on the offensive, and try to kill their younger sibling.
		A bit later, they&apos;re finally convinced to calm the heck down, and even repent for their actions, but the point is still clear.
		These two aren&apos;t simply non-believers, they believe and just aren&apos;t followers of Jehovah.
		Christians have a tendency to think you&apos;re &quot;rejecting&quot; their god if you don&apos;t believe in him.
		You can&apos;t reject what you don&apos;t believe to be real though.
		These two characters are later necessary for some major racism, but aside from that, their main purpose seems to be to portray the attitude on those that don&apos;t follow Jehovah, but with a very different attitude than people that actually don&apos;t follow Jehovah tend to have.
		By misrepresenting us atheists as actively rebellious instead of as simply not seeing a reason to believe, it makes it much easier for the Mormons to claim we&apos;re wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later still, we even see a direct confirmation that these two are denying what they&apos;ve seen.
		Laman&apos;s seen speaking here, claiming the angels aren&apos;t talking to Nephi, even though one of them earlier even showed himself to them:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 16:</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that angels have ministered unto him.
				But behold, we know that he lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure.
				And after this manner did my brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger. 
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		Clearly, the implication here is that people will deny very obvious evidence of Jehovah.
		It&apos;s an attempt to deny the actual reality, which is that there <strong>*is no*</strong> obvious evidence of Jehovah.
		All anyone has about him is circumstantial.
		No one ever sees hide nor hair of the guy.
		Here, we see that pointed out as well:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 17:30</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the true and living God.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		... and again:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 17:45 - 17:47</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God.
				Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder.
			</p>
			<p>
				And ye also know that by the power of his almighty word he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that by his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up.
				O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts?
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
</section>
<section id="offerings">
	<h2>Offerings</h2>
	<div id="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 5:9, 7:22</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God of Israel.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our father.
				And after I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto him.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		You&apos;re supposed to burn offerings for Jehovah.
		Just sayin&apos;.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="brass">
	<h2>Brass plates</h2>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 5:18 - 5:19</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time.
				And he prophesied many things concerning his seed.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		The plates mentioned above are the brass plates stolen by Nephi from Laban after the former killed the latter.
		(Jehovah orders Nephi to kill Laban several times, and eventually he caves and does it, before stealing the plates Jehovah sent him to recover.)
		Supposedly though, these plates will never perish or be &quot;dimmed&quot;.
		I&apos;m guessing that dimming here is referring to the plates becoming corroded, though it might instead refer to them becoming soiled.
		Perhaps even both.
		In any case though, if these plates are to last forever, where are they now?
		Seriously.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="inbreeding">
	<h2>Inbreeding</h2>
	<p>
		Lehi takes his spouse and children into the wilderness, away from Jerusalem, upon request by Jehovah.
		They don&apos;t go too far though, as when Jehovah commands the children to return long enough to recover the brass plates from their owner in Jerusalem, they&apos;re able to comply.
		Jehovah want Lehi&apos;s children to breed though, to create his new people, but all the children are male.
		When they murder the owner and steal the plates, they also take away the owner&apos;s slave, Zoram, and convince him to live with them in the wilderness.
		However, the slave is male too.
		So to breed, they need females, and Jehovah tells them to bring a specific other family with them into the wilderness.
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 7:1 - 7:2</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And now I would that ye might know, that after my father, Lehi, had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was not meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the wilderness alone; but that his sons should take daughters to wife, that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of promise.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi, and my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		So they do as they were commanded again.
		They talk this family into coming out into the wilderness with them, and the children of the two families marry and breed.
		There&apos;s a few more people though, as we see from this passage:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 7:6</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness, behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and the two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us; yea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and his wife, and his three other daughters. 
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		The mentioned rebellion ends up ended a bit later when Jehovah steps in, but take a look at who&apos;s there.
		We have the four sons of Lehi and Sariah, Ishmael, Ishmael&apos;s wife, the five daughters of Ishmael, the two sons of Ishmael, the two wives of the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmael&apos;s grandchildren.
		Lehi, Sariah, and Zoram aren&apos;t present in this scene, but the listed party&apos;s going to meet up with them.
		If you notice, there are four unwed males and five unwed females, which means one of the unwed females gets paired up with Zoram, adding his <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to the mix.
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 16:7</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of Ishmael to wife.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		So in the complete party, everyone&apos;s entire genetics can be traced back to some combination of Lehi, Sariah, Zoram, Ishmael, Ishmael&apos;s wife, and the two wives of Ishmael&apos;s sons.
		That&apos;s seven people.
		After that, they travel pretty far out, and end up in the land of promise.
		Along the way, they breed, and when they get there, they breed.
		The first generation after this might be able to avoid inbreeding, but after that, all later generations are guaranteed to be composed entirely of inbred people.
		Jehovah&apos;s entire new people, the Nephites, are inbred, as as are their enemy, the Lamanites, who branched off from this same set of people.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="virginity">
	<h2>Visible virginity?</h2>
	<p>
		Here&apos;s an exert I found confusing:
	</p>
	<div id="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 11:13 - 11:15</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities.
				And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me:
				Nephi, what beholdest thou?

			<p>
				And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.

		Nephi is being shown a vision by the Holy Spirit.
		The spirit has taken a corporeal form and asks Nephi to look.
		When he does, he sees the spirit has vanished, and behind where he&apos;d been standing he sees the scene from the above passage.
		Somehow, he can see this person&apos;s virginity, and instead of calling her a person or a maiden, calls her a virgin.
		That&apos;s what he sees in her: she&apos;s never had sex.
		First of all, how would he even see that?
		What does virginity look like?
		But secondly, why is that the thing he points out about her?
		The only explanation is that it needs to be made clear who she is to the reader, and it is later revealed that she&apos;s the virgin mother of the messiah.
		This seems like a bit of a plot hole to me.

	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 11:32 - 11:33</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying:
				Look!
				And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.

				And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.

		One of the main themes of the Abrahamic religions is that we&apos;re all flawed, and for us to be saved, someone had to pay the price.
		A just and fair god would not punish one person for the crimes of another.
		Jehovah is not a just god.
		If we deserve forgiveness, a just god could forgive us without someone else taking the blame for us.
		If we don&apos;t deserve forgiveness, someone taking on our punishments shouldn&apos;t make us magically forgiveable.
		The proper thing to do would be to make us pay for our own crimes, then once we&apos;ve made amends, forgive us.
		This whole messiah thing is just a way for people to make themselves feel good because they think they&apos;re getting out of what they think they deserve.
		To someone with a real conscience though, the thought of having someone else take on your punishment for you is utterly appalling.

	<h2>Hell</h2>
	<p>
		The Mormons say no one goes to hell, and instead, everyone on earth will instead go to one of several heavens.
		So why does the Book of Mormon claim there to be a hell?
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 14:3</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And that great pit, which hath been digged for them by that great and abominable church, which was founded by the devil and his children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell-yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the destruction of men shall be filled by those who digged it, unto their utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of the soul, save it be the casting of it into that hell which hath no end.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		This hell is said to be where the wicked go, because they&apos;re filthy and no filth is allowed in the kingdom of Jehovah.
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 15:34 - 15:35</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful hell of which I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it; wherefore the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that justice of which I have spoken.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		The Book of Mormon also claims that there are only two churches, and everyone has to belong to one.
		That&apos;s right, if you believe nothing and follow no one, you&apos;re somehow a part of a church anyway: the devil&apos;s church:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 14:10</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And he said unto me:
				Behold there are save two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.

	<h2>Prophesy</h2>
	<p>
		Some prophesies are found in the Book of Mormon.
		For example, the crusifiction of the Christ is predicted:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 19:8</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		If you assume the Book of Mormon to be true, this is amazing.
		About six hundred years before this happens, it&apos;s been written.
		Keep in mind there&apos;s no evidence that they Book of Mormon was written by anyone other than Joseph Smith though.
		In other words, it&apos;s not a prediction of the future; it&apos;s a prediction of the past cleverly disguised as a past prediction of the future.
		It makes the Book of Mormon seem more divinely inspired, as it&apos;s telling what supposedly hadn&apos;t happened yet.
		But in the end, there&apos;s no reason to believe that&apos;s anything more than a trick.

		Hold on.
		We&apos;re not quite ready to tackle this one yet, but I need to keep track of this quote:
	</p>
	<p>
		Jehovah foreshadows that he&apos;ll curse the Lemanites:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 2:21, 2:23 - 2:24</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.
			</p>
			<p>
				For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I will curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also.
			</p>
			<p>
				And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
	<p>
		Nephi sees in a vision that the seed of his brethren will become &quot;dark&quot;:
	</p>
	<div class="cited-quotation">
		<cite>1 Nephi 12:23</cite>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				And it came to pass that I beheld, after they had dwindled in unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations.
