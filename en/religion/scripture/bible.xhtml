			<h1>The Holy Bible</h1>
			<p>An atheist reads the bible</p>
		</header>
<p>
	I took some notes on the random scriptures we were studying in church here, but now I&apos;ve deleted them.
	As I started reading the bible from the beginning, it was easiest to just start my notes from the beginning too to avoid duplicate notes.
	Furthermore, my notes here will be in chronological order as to when the passages come up in the bible.
	I might arrange them by topic later on, when I&apos;ve read further.
	Without further ado ...
</p>
<h2>Genesis</h2>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 1:6 - 1:8</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said,
			&quot;Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
		</p>
		<p>
			God called the expanse &quot;sky&quot;.
			There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Right here, near the beginning of the bible, we have passages that contradict science, and are therefore incorrect.
	The first of these three passages says that there&apos;s an expanse that divides water from water.
	In other words, there&apos;s water on both sides of this expanse.
	The second explains that one body of water exists above the expanse and one below.
	And the third tells us that the expanse in question is the sky itself.
	This tells us that there&apos;s a body of water below the sky, which I assumed to be the ocean (and this was later confirmed in Genesis 1:10), but also that there&apos;s a body of water <strong>*above*</strong> the sky.
	What body of water exists above the sky?
	Above the sky, the atmosphere, we have sort of a void.
	It&apos;s not completely empty by any means, but outer space isn&apos;t exactly full of water, either.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; 
		</p>
		<p>
			and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;&quot; and it was so.
		</p>
		<p>
			God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.
			He also made the stars.
		</p>
		<p>
			God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,
		</p>
		<p>
			and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness.
			God saw that it was good.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Taken alone, these passages don&apos;t seem so bad.
	However, try combining them with the passages above, which tell us what the sky is.
	The sky is the expanse between the waters.
	There are no upper waters, so such an expanse between them can&apos;t exist, but if we claim outer space to be the upper waters, that defines the sky as the atmosphere.
	These passages tell us that the sun, moon, and stars are within the sky, making them within our atmosphere.
	Science disputes that heavily.
	All of these celestial bodies are far removed from our tiny atmosphere, and even a single one of them wouldn&apos;t fit within it.
	These things are huge.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 1:29</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said, &quot;Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	In this passage, Yahweh is speaking to the freshly-created pair of humans.
	These are the uncorrupted, perfect humans.
	According to Christianity, our uncorrupted form is mean to be herbivoracious.
	Read literally, we&apos;re supposed to eat herbs and fruit trees, though my take is that we&apos;re supposed to eat herbs and fruit <strong>*from*</strong> fruit trees.
	That just makes more sense.
	But yeah.
	According to this, meat consumption is a corruption of the initial design, so it&apos;d probably be wise to avoid it.
	Go eat plants instead, you herbivore, you.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 1:11 - 1:13</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said, &quot;Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;&quot; and it was so.
		</p>
		<p>
			The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, we&apos;re told that Yahweh made plants on on the third day.
	And not only did he make plants, but those plants included grass and herbs.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 2:2, 2:5</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
		</p>
		<p>
			No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth.
			There was not a man to till the ground,
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	However, just as early as the beginning of the next chapter, we&apos;re told that Yahweh hadn&apos;t made field plants yet.
	Field herbs are mentioned separately.
	Maybe Yahweh only made the non-field herbs, saving field herbs for later?
	Whatever the case is though, grass is most certainly a field plant.
	If you don&apos;t have any field plants, you don&apos;t have grass.
	Maybe it means <strong>*cultivated*</strong> field plants?
	It seems like a stretch, but maybe that&apos;s what it&apos;s referring to.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 2:10, 2:</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name of the third river is Hiddekel.
			This is the one which flows in front of Assyria.
			The fourth river is the Euphrates. 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	The Euphrates?
	As in, the Fertile Crescent&apos;s Euphrates?
	Perhaps it&apos;s another river by the same name, but if it&apos;s not, that means we can follow the Euphrates to its source to find Eden.
	Maps indicate otherwise though.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 2:16 - 2:17</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, &quot;You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
		</p>
		<p>
			but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Don&apos;t eat from that tree, or in the day you eat of it, you&apos;ll die.
	Am I getting that right?
	So if Yahweh was honest, Adam wouldn&apos;t be able to start a family after eating from the tree and being expelled form the garden.
	Yahweh was lying, but lying is a sin, Yahweh doesn&apos;t sin, and Yahweh specifically doesn&apos;t lie.
	This isn&apos;t adding up.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:2 - 3:5</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The woman said to the serpent, &quot;We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,
		</p>
		<p>
			but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, &apos;You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.&apos; &quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			The serpent said to the woman, &quot;You won&apos;t really die,
		</p>
		<p>
			for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	First, the woman paraphrases.
	Either that, or Yahweh gave her slightly-different information than she did the man, but gave it to her outside of the depicted scenes.
	We never actually see when the woman is told not to eat from the tree, only the man, and only before the woman was created.
	Her paraphrasing is actually closer to the truth than what was told Adam though.
	She&apos;s told she&apos;ll die if she touches the tree.
	No time frame for that death is given.
	Adam was told though that he&apos;d die the day he ate from the tree, which didn&apos;t happen and establishes Yahweh as a liar.
	Next, the serpent tells the woman that she&apos;ll have her eyes opened and she gains a similar understanding as Yahweh, just as the serpent informed her.
	The serpent was mostly honest, while Yahweh was a liar.
	While it&apos;s not said in this chapter in the book too, my understanding is that lack of access to the tree of life is why these people would die.
	They were driven from the garden and no longer had access to the tree of life.
	If they&apos;d eaten from the tree of life <strong>*before*</strong> the tree of knowledge, they therefore would have lived.
	That is, unless continual access to the tree of life&apos;s fruit is required.
	In other words, eating from the tree of knowledge doesn&apos;t actually kill you.
	It&apos;s Yahweh driving you away from the tree of life that kills you.
	This means that the serpent may have been completely honest with them.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God said to the woman, &quot;What have you done?&quot;
			The woman said, &quot;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>*Did*</strong> the serpent deceive her?
	Or did the serpent just give her the honest facts?
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:14</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God said to the serpent,
			&quot;Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field.
			You shall go on your belly and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, we see the origin of why snakes have no legs, and must instead slither on their bellies, unlike other animals.
	Do you know what that means?
	It means this was a literal snake.
	It wasn&apos;t Satan in disguise like modern Christians claim.
	The intent of the snake in this store was to show why literal snakes have no legs.
	The snake here is nothing more.
	Also, the ancient people that wrote this fable were convinced that snakes eat dust.
	They weren&apos;t aware that they&apos;re actually predators, and eat insects, rodents, birds, and things of that nature.
</p>
<p>
	Oh, and by the way, snakes can talk.
	That&apos;s a thing they can do, apparently.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:15</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			&quot;I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring.
			He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	This is why people hate and attack snakes.
	It&apos;s not an instinctual, self-defence mechanism.
	It&apos;s a curse.
	Humans that descend from Eve, which is to say everyone that isn&apos;t Adam, are cursed to be hostile towards snakes.
	Likewise, snakes aren&apos;t attacking out of fear or in self-defence.
	Again, it&apos;s this same curse.
	I&apos;d also like to point out here that the <strong>*descendants*</strong> of the snake and the woman, who Yahweh was claiming wronged him, are cursed.
	You&apos;re punished for the sins of your parents.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:16</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			To the woman he said,
			&quot;I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
			You will bear children in pain.
			Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, Yahweh didn&apos;t curse her children, but specifically her.
	Yet somehow the childbirth pain part carries over to her female children?
	It could have been poor wording on Yahweh&apos;s part, and he intended it the same way as the snake/human hostility curse.
	As for the man ruling over the woman, this part sounds like it was a way for religion to back sexism in the past age of sexism in which it was written in.
	There&apos;s no excuse for that sexism in the modern world, and should be fixed even in the church.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:17 - 3:19</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			To Adam he said,
			&quot;Because you have listened to your wife&apos;s voice, and have eaten from the tree, about which I commanded you, saying, &apos;You shall not eat of it,&apos; the ground is cursed for your sake.
			You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground, for you were taken out of it.
			For you are dust, and you shall return to dust.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	You listened to your wife.
	Now I&apos;m going to make life hard for you.
	Oh.
	Well.
	Better not do that again!
	Again, sounds like grounds for placing the men in charge and ignoring what the women have to say.
	It sounds like an attempt to justify sexism through religion.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:22 - 3:24</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God said, &quot;Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever-&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
		</p>
		<p>
			So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	What did I say when discussion what the serpent had said?
	Just this!
	This right here!
	The tree of knowledge&apos;s fruit doesn&apos;t kill you.
	It&apos;s lack of access to the tree of life&apos;s fruit that kills you.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, it looks like Yahweh was specifically upset that humans would know good and evil.
	Humans aren&apos;t allowed such knowledge, so they have to die.
	So.
	Um.
	Why put the tree there?
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;d also like to point out that the Mormons think Adam and Eve couldn&apos;t follow both the commandment to avoid the fruit of this one tree and the commandment to be fruitful and multiply.
	However, this second commandment wasn&apos;t given, at least at the time they ate the fruit.
	It might be given later on.
	In any case, being fruitful and multiplying was not a requirement as of this time.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 4:1 - 4:2, 4:10 - 4:12, 4:16 - 4:17</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said,
			&quot;I have gotten a man with Yahweh&apos;s help.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Again she gave birth, to Cain&apos;s brother Abel.
			Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
		</p>
		<p>
			...
		</p>
		<p>
			Yahweh said,
			&quot;What have you done?
			The voice of your brother&apos;s blood cries to me from the ground.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&apos;s blood from your hand.
		</p>
		<p>
			From now on, when you till the ground, it won&apos;t yield its strength to you.
			You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			...
		</p>
		<p>
			Cain left Yahweh&apos;s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cain knew his wife.
			She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch.
			He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Um.
	What?
	After killing his brother Abel, Cain is banished from Yahweh&apos;s presence.
	He then finds a wife.
	The only people at this point are Adam, Eve, and Abel.
	(There was Cain, but Abel killed him.)
	Is there some other group of people now that didn&apos;t come from Adam and Eve?
	Maybe Adam and Eve were a side creation, and humanity actually existed before them?
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 4:25</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Adam knew his wife again.
			She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, &quot;for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Adam and Eve had a third child.
	This is <strong>*after*</strong> Abel had been murdered and <strong>*after*</strong> Cain has been banished.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 5:4</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters. 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>*After*</strong> Seth was born, Adam and Eve created more children, which are not named within the pages of the Bible.
	But there&apos;s enough information here to draw up a timeline on some events.
	Cain was banished and had a child with his wife, <strong>*then*</strong> Cain&apos;s sisters came into being.
	That means Cain&apos;s wife is not his sister, and it&apos;s obvious she&apos;s not Eve.
	Something&apos;s not adding up here.
	As I mentioned before, this makes sense if Adam and Eve weren&apos;t the only humans Yahweh directly created himself, but doesn&apos;t make sense otherwise.
