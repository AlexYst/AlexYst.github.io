			<h1>The Holy Bible</h1>
			<p>An atheist reads the bible</p>
		</header>
<p>
	I took some notes on the random scriptures we were studying in church here, but now I&apos;ve deleted them.
	As I started reading the bible from the beginning, it was easiest to just start my notes from the beginning too to avoid duplicate notes.
	Furthermore, my notes here will be in chronological order as to when the passages come up in the bible.
	I might arrange them by topic later on, when I&apos;ve read further.
	Without further ado ...
</p>
<h2>Genesis</h2>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 1:6 - 1:8</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said,
			&quot;Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
		</p>
		<p>
			God called the expanse &quot;sky&quot;.
			There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Right here, near the beginning of the bible, we have passages that contradict science, and are therefore incorrect.
	The first of these three passages says that there&apos;s an expanse that divides water from water.
	In other words, there&apos;s water on both sides of this expanse.
	The second explains that one body of water exists above the expanse and one below.
	And the third tells us that the expanse in question is the sky itself.
	This tells us that there&apos;s a body of water below the sky, which I assumed to be the ocean (and this was later confirmed in Genesis 1:10), but also that there&apos;s a body of water <strong>*above*</strong> the sky.
	What body of water exists above the sky?
	Above the sky, the atmosphere, we have sort of a void.
	It&apos;s not completely empty by any means, but outer space isn&apos;t exactly full of water, either.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; 
		</p>
		<p>
			and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;&quot; and it was so.
		</p>
		<p>
			God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.
			He also made the stars.
		</p>
		<p>
			God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,
		</p>
		<p>
			and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness.
			God saw that it was good.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Taken alone, these passages don&apos;t seem so bad.
	However, try combining them with the passages above, which tell us what the sky is.
	The sky is the expanse between the waters.
	There are no upper waters, so such an expanse between them can&apos;t exist, but if we claim outer space to be the upper waters, that defines the sky as the atmosphere.
	These passages tell us that the sun, moon, and stars are within the sky, making them within our atmosphere.
	Science disputes that heavily.
	All of these celestial bodies are far removed from our tiny atmosphere, and even a single one of them wouldn&apos;t fit within it.
	These things are huge.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 1:29</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said, &quot;Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	In this passage, Yahweh is speaking to the freshly-created pair of humans.
	These are the uncorrupted, perfect humans.
	According to Christianity, our uncorrupted form is mean to be herbivoracious.
	Read literally, we&apos;re supposed to eat herbs and fruit trees, though my take is that we&apos;re supposed to eat herbs and fruit <strong>*from*</strong> fruit trees.
	That just makes more sense.
	But yeah.
	According to this, meat consumption is a corruption of the initial design, so it&apos;d probably be wise to avoid it.
	Go eat plants instead, you herbivore, you.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 1:11 - 1:13</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			God said, &quot;Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;&quot; and it was so.
		</p>
		<p>
			The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, we&apos;re told that Yahweh made plants on on the third day.
	And not only did he make plants, but those plants included grass and herbs.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 2:2, 2:5</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
		</p>
		<p>
			No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth.
			There was not a man to till the ground,
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	However, just as early as the beginning of the next chapter, we&apos;re told that Yahweh hadn&apos;t made field plants yet.
	Field herbs are mentioned separately.
	Maybe Yahweh only made the non-field herbs, saving field herbs for later?
	Whatever the case is though, grass is most certainly a field plant.
	If you don&apos;t have any field plants, you don&apos;t have grass.
	Maybe it means <strong>*cultivated*</strong> field plants?
	It seems like a stretch, but maybe that&apos;s what it&apos;s referring to.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 2:10, 2:</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name of the third river is Hiddekel.
			This is the one which flows in front of Assyria.
			The fourth river is the Euphrates. 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	The Euphrates?
	As in, the Fertile Crescent&apos;s Euphrates?
	Perhaps it&apos;s another river by the same name, but if it&apos;s not, that means we can follow the Euphrates to its source to find Eden.
	Maps indicate otherwise though.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 2:16 - 2:17</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, &quot;You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
		</p>
		<p>
			but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Don&apos;t eat from that tree, or in the day you eat of it, you&apos;ll die.
	Am I getting that right?
	So if Yahweh was honest, Adam wouldn&apos;t be able to start a family after eating from the tree and being expelled form the garden.
	Yahweh was lying, but lying is a sin, Yahweh doesn&apos;t sin, and Yahweh specifically doesn&apos;t lie.
	This isn&apos;t adding up.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:2 - 3:5</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The woman said to the serpent, &quot;We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,
		</p>
		<p>
			but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, &apos;You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.&apos; &quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			The serpent said to the woman, &quot;You won&apos;t really die,
		</p>
		<p>
			for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	First, the woman paraphrases.
	Either that, or Yahweh gave her slightly-different information than she did the man, but gave it to her outside of the depicted scenes.
	We never actually see when the woman is told not to eat from the tree, only the man, and only before the woman was created.
	Her paraphrasing is actually closer to the truth than what was told Adam though.
	She&apos;s told she&apos;ll die if she touches the tree.
	No time frame for that death is given.
	Adam was told though that he&apos;d die the day he ate from the tree, which didn&apos;t happen and establishes Yahweh as a liar.
	Next, the serpent tells the woman that she&apos;ll have her eyes opened and she gains a similar understanding as Yahweh, just as the serpent informed her.
	The serpent was mostly honest, while Yahweh was a liar.
	While it&apos;s not said in this chapter in the book too, my understanding is that lack of access to the tree of life is why these people would die.
	They were driven from the garden and no longer had access to the tree of life.
	If they&apos;d eaten from the tree of life <strong>*before*</strong> the tree of knowledge, they therefore would have lived.
	That is, unless continual access to the tree of life&apos;s fruit is required.
	In other words, eating from the tree of knowledge doesn&apos;t actually kill you.
	It&apos;s Yahweh driving you away from the tree of life that kills you.
	This means that the serpent may have been completely honest with them.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God said to the woman, &quot;What have you done?&quot;
			The woman said, &quot;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>*Did*</strong> the serpent deceive her?
	Or did the serpent just give her the honest facts?
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:14</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God said to the serpent,
			&quot;Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field.
			You shall go on your belly and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, we see the origin of why snakes have no legs, and must instead slither on their bellies, unlike other animals.
	Do you know what that means?
	It means this was a literal snake.
	It wasn&apos;t Satan in disguise like modern Christians claim.
	The intent of the snake in this store was to show why literal snakes have no legs.
	The snake here is nothing more.
	Also, the ancient people that wrote this fable were convinced that snakes eat dust.
	They weren&apos;t aware that they&apos;re actually predators, and eat insects, rodents, birds, and things of that nature.
</p>
<p>
	Oh, and by the way, snakes can talk.
	That&apos;s a thing they can do, apparently.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:15</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			&quot;I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring.
			He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	This is why people hate and attack snakes.
	It&apos;s not an instinctual, self-defence mechanism.
	It&apos;s a curse.
	Humans that descend from Eve, which is to say everyone that isn&apos;t Adam, are cursed to be hostile towards snakes.
	Likewise, snakes aren&apos;t attacking out of fear or in self-defence.
	Again, it&apos;s this same curse.
	I&apos;d also like to point out here that the <strong>*descendants*</strong> of the snake and the woman, who Yahweh was claiming wronged him, are cursed.
	You&apos;re punished for the sins of your parents.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:16</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			To the woman he said,
			&quot;I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
			You will bear children in pain.
			Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, Yahweh didn&apos;t curse her children, but specifically her.
	Yet somehow the childbirth pain part carries over to her female children?
	It could have been poor wording on Yahweh&apos;s part, and he intended it the same way as the snake/human hostility curse.
	As for the man ruling over the woman, this part sounds like it was a way for religion to back sexism in the past age of sexism in which it was written in.
	There&apos;s no excuse for that sexism in the modern world, and should be fixed even in the church.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:17 - 3:19</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			To Adam he said,
			&quot;Because you have listened to your wife&apos;s voice, and have eaten from the tree, about which I commanded you, saying, &apos;You shall not eat of it,&apos; the ground is cursed for your sake.
			You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground, for you were taken out of it.
			For you are dust, and you shall return to dust.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	You listened to your wife.
	Now I&apos;m going to make life hard for you.
	Oh.
	Well.
	Better not do that again!
	Again, sounds like grounds for placing the men in charge and ignoring what the women have to say.
	It sounds like an attempt to justify sexism through religion.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 3:22 - 3:24</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh God said, &quot;Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever-&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
		</p>
		<p>
			So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	What did I say when discussion what the serpent had said?
	Just this!
	This right here!
	The tree of knowledge&apos;s fruit doesn&apos;t kill you.
	It&apos;s lack of access to the tree of life&apos;s fruit that kills you.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, it looks like Yahweh was specifically upset that humans would know good and evil.
	Humans aren&apos;t allowed such knowledge, so they have to die.
	So.
	Um.
	Why put the tree there?
</p>
<p>
	I&apos;d also like to point out that the Mormons think Adam and Eve couldn&apos;t follow both the commandment to avoid the fruit of this one tree and the commandment to be fruitful and multiply.
	However, this second commandment wasn&apos;t given, at least at the time they ate the fruit.
	It might be given later on.
	In any case, being fruitful and multiplying was not a requirement as of this time.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 4:1 - 4:2, 4:10 - 4:12, 4:16 - 4:17</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said,
			&quot;I have gotten a man with Yahweh&apos;s help.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			Again she gave birth, to Cain&apos;s brother Abel.
			Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
		</p>
		<p>
			...
		</p>
		<p>
			Yahweh said,
			&quot;What have you done?
			The voice of your brother&apos;s blood cries to me from the ground.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&apos;s blood from your hand.
		</p>
		<p>
			From now on, when you till the ground, it won&apos;t yield its strength to you.
			You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			...
		</p>
		<p>
			Cain left Yahweh&apos;s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cain knew his wife.
			She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch.
			He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Um.
	What?
	After killing his brother Abel, Cain is banished from Yahweh&apos;s presence.
	He then finds a wife.
	The only people at this point are Adam, Eve, and Abel.
	(There was Cain, but Abel killed him.)
	Is there some other group of people now that didn&apos;t come from Adam and Eve?
	Maybe Adam and Eve were a side creation, and humanity actually existed before them?
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 4:25</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Adam knew his wife again.
			She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, &quot;for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Adam and Eve had a third child.
	This is <strong>*after*</strong> Abel had been murdered and <strong>*after*</strong> Cain has been banished.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 5:4</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters. 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	<strong>*After*</strong> Seth was born, Adam and Eve created more children, which are not named within the pages of the Bible.
	But there&apos;s enough information here to draw up a timeline on some events.
	Cain was banished and had a child with his wife, <strong>*then*</strong> Cain&apos;s sisters came into being.
	That means Cain&apos;s wife is not his sister, and it&apos;s obvious she&apos;s not Eve.
	Something&apos;s not adding up here.
	As I mentioned before, this makes sense if Adam and Eve weren&apos;t the only humans Yahweh directly created himself, but doesn&apos;t make sense otherwise.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 6:3</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh said,
			&quot;My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	I&apos;m not sure exactly what Yahweh&apos;s logic here is.
	Like, I&apos;m reading these words, and I don&apos;t know what they mean.
	Because humans are made of flesh, he won&apos;t work with us forever?
	But <strong>*also*</strong> flesh?
	Is he saying that he&apos;s flesh as well, and because we&apos;re like him in that regard, he won&apos;t work with us as long as he had worked with past generations, who were flesh as well?
	If that&apos;s the case, it makes little to no sense.
</p>
<p>
	In any case, he just shortened the human life span down to one hundred twenty years.
	For reference, compare that to the several-hundred-year lifespans mentioned in the chapter just prior.
	But did he shorten it again?
	Because people in biblical times didn&apos;t have such long lifespans as that.
	We still don&apos;t to this day, at least in the typical case, and our lifespans have increased since biblical times due to advancements in science.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 6:5 - 6:7</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of man&apos;s heart was continually only evil.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yahweh said,
			&quot;I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground-man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky-for I am sorry that I have made them.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Humans are evil.
	Therefore, Yahweh is sorry that he made the non-human animals (in addition to being sorry he created humans), who did nothing wrong.
	Um.
	What?
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 6:14 - 6:20</cite>

	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	According to the annotations in my bible, a cubit is about forty-six centimetres.
	So the boat will be one hundred thirty metres long and twenty-three metres wide.
	We can see that the boat will also be a little under fourteen metres tall, but we can set that aside in favour of a more-important figure.
	Specifically, the number of floors seems more relevant to me, and there will be three floors.
	If you want to carry two of every species, or even just <strong>*one*</strong> of every species for that matter, you&apos;re going to need a lot more space than that.
	You just can&apos;t fit them all on the boat.
</p>
<p>
	Also, this is to preserve all these species, right?
	Just think of the amount of inbreeding after the flood!
	The creatures that remain will be severely deformed after a few generations.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, I thought Yahweh was sorry he created the non-human animals.
	Why is he saving them then?
	The reason he&apos;s sorry he created humans is because they&apos;re all evil at this point.
	Most are, anyway.
	He found one family of people he thought weren&apos;t evil.
	So, it makes sense that he&apos;d spare those people.
	However, that has nothing to do with the other animals.
	If they&apos;re not a problem, why is he sorry he made them?
	And if he&apos;s sorry he made them, why is he preserving them?

	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Okay.
	They&apos;re going on a journey, and they need rations.
	But how long will they be travelling for?
	How much should they bring?
	Yahweh doesn&apos;t provide enough detail here for Noah to bring the right amount of supplies.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">

		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	In the last chapter, I pointed out that there wasn&apos;t enough space for two of each animal species on the boat, given its dimensions.
	But now, Yahweh is upping the animal count.
	For some animals, there&apos;s still only two of a kind, but for other, Noah&apos;s got to bring fourteen.
	Again, there&apos;s not enough space for that.
</p>
<p>
	Having extras like this would help a bit with the inbreeding problem, but I feel like you&apos;d still need a bigger starting population to get enough genetic diversity to fully alleviate the problem.
	Additionally, as there&apos;s still only two of some species, the inbreeding problem is still in full force for those species.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 7:4</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Okay, three things here.
	First, I mentioned before that in the last chapter, Yahweh didn&apos;t tell Noah how much food to bring nor how long the trip would be, which could sort of act as a substitute because Noah could estimate or calculate how much food would be needed from that.
	So, now that problem is solved.
</p>
<p>
	But Noah&apos;s got to stockpile over a month&apos;s worth of food and build an enormous boat all within the span of a week.
	There&apos;s no way that he and his family are up to that sort of task.
	It takes longer than that for skilled crews of workers to build smaller boats using modern technology.
	Ignoring the food-gathering, there&apos;s not enough time to build the boat!
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, if there wasn&apos;t enough room on the boat for the animals, there certainly wouldn&apos;t be enough room for the animals <strong>*and*</strong> the massive quantities of food they&apos;d need to survive the long journey.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 7:11</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			In the six hundredth year of Noah&apos;s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the sky&apos;s windows opened.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, we get a glimpse of how the ancient Christians - or rather, the Jewish, who wrote the beginning of the bible - thought that the world was set up.
	There are fountains in the ocean, from which water can pour in and cause sea levels to rise.
	Likewise, rain comes from windows in the sky.
	Remember when I talked about there being water above the sky as mentioned in Genesis 1:6 through 1:8?
	Yeah.
	So rain actually comes from above the sky in their view, through these sky windows.
	That means that rain either comes from beyond our atmosphere or the stars are within our atmosphere.
	Either way, the stars are <strong>*within*</strong> the sky, while the rain comes from the border between the sky and the waters above.
	Stars are closer to us than the source of rain, according to this book.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 7:19 - 7:20</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The waters rose very high on the earth.
			All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
		</p>
		<p>
			The waters rose fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	As I mentioned before, my bible&apos;s annotations indicate that a cubit is about forty-six centimetres.
	So for reference, that makes the flood waters about 6.9 metres higher than the tallest mountain.
</p>
<p>
	On the highest mountains, you have to worry about the air being too thin.
	Almost seven metres above that?
	Yeah.
	My first thought was that you&apos;re going to have trouble breathing.
	But air has volume.
	It takes up space.
	The water would displace it.
	Would the air then be breathable at that altitude simply because the thicker air below was pushed up?
</p>
<p>
	What about temperature.
	It&apos;s cold up in the mountains, and colder above them.
	Would the water and the displaced air displace the temperature regions as well?
	I&apos;m honestly not sure.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 7:24</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Oh.
	Right.
	I mentioned that Noah now had a time frame as far as how long he&apos;d need to keep his family and the other animals alive on the food he stockpiled.
	But he actually didn&apos;t.
	He was told how long it would rain, not how long the flood would last.
	So he needed enough food for the one hundred fifty days, which I don&apos;t think included the forty days the waters took to rise.
	So he needed enough food for a total of one hundred ninety days.
	Not only is there no way that&apos;d fit on the boat with the animals, he also wasn&apos;t even told he&apos;d need that much.
	He and the rest of the animals would have starved for sure.
	I mean, assuming he and the rest of the animals were magically on the boat in the first place, even though they couldn&apos;t all fit.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 8:2</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The deep&apos;s fountains and the sky&apos;s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Again, this tells us that water can be pumped into our world via fountains underwater and via windows in the sky.
	As mentioned before, there&apos;s water above the sky, and rain is what you get when the water comes down through windows between the sky and the waters above.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 8:3</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The waters continually receded from the earth.
			After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters receded.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Is this saying that it took a span of one hundred fifty days for the water to recede, in which case even <strong>*more*</strong> rations would have been needed?
	That would mean that almost a year worth of food would be needed for every animal on the ship, including the humans.
	Or is this saying that after the one hundred fifty days of having the world flooded, the time span mentioned before, the waters receded?
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 8:10 - 8:11</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf.
			So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Wait a minute.
	Noah knew the waters had receded enough to allow the dove to locate an olive tree and pluck a leaf from it.
	Yahweh just flooded the planet and killed every living thing, save for those on the boat.
	There are no plants, or at least no land plants.
	They drowned
	All the trees would be dead at this point.
	At smallest estimate, it&apos;s been one hundred fifty days; almost three fifths of a year.
	That&apos;s if the one hundred fifty days mentioned in the receding are the same days as the one hundred fifty mentioned as the flood duration, and if the forty days of rain were also included in the one hundred fifty days of flooding.
	If not, the flood was even longer.
	But even at one hundred fifty days, the leaves of all the dead trees would have long since rotted.
	You&apos;re not finding fresh olive leaves at this point.
</p>
<p>
	Wow.
	I was so caught up in how you can&apos;t keep that many animals alive on such a small boat that I forgot that plants and fungi would need to be saved as well.
	But they didn&apos;t get saved, so all of those would have died out.
	This is a case where the ancient people who made up this story weren&apos;t aware of the fact that plants and fungi need to breathe, just like animals do.
	Their ignorance didn&apos;t make it any less true in their time though.
	Had the flood happened, there would be no olive trees to find.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 8:20</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	First of all, I&apos;d like to point out that you&apos;re supposed to burn offerings to Yahweh, the lord, your god.
	If you&apos;re not doing that, Yahweh probably isn&apos;t happy with you.
	You think that&apos;s a practice done only by ancient, archaic religions?
	Well, you&apos;re right, but Christianity <strong>*is*</strong> an ancient, archaic religion.
	Don&apos;t forget that.
</p>
<p>
	But also, Noah just wasted some of the remaining biodiversity he&apos;d just saved.
	That&apos;s not exactly a good idea.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">

	<blockquote>

	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	No one is told to be fruitful or multiply before this point.
	At least no one human is.
	Yahweh told the non-human animals to be fruitful and multiply early on, and he might have told the plants that too.
	I don&apos;t quite remember.
	In any case, the Mormons believe that Adam and Eve were given this commandment, but the scriptures don&apos;t back up this belief.
</p>
<p>
	Also, why did Yahweh tell Noah and his sons to be fruitful and multiply, but didn&apos;t tell that to Noah&apos;s wife or Noah&apos;s sons&apos; wives?
	Aren&apos;t they going to need the help of the women if they&apos;re going to pull this one off?
	Why is Yahweh speaking only to the men, and not everybody?
</p>

</div>
<p>
	Here, humans are given permission to eat animals.
	If it moves and lives, it&apos;s food.
</p>
<p>
	Come to think of it, this says it&apos;s all food.
	Every single moving thing that lives.
	Ignoring the obvious fact that cannibalism is allowed by this overly-broad statement, poisonous animals are included as well.
	Poisonous animals are food.

<p>
	But don&apos;t eat blood.
	What are you, some sort of vampire?
	I guess eating blood sausage is a sin.
	Not that I really care, seeing as I choose to be an herbivore, anyway.
	The message here though is that you&apos;ve got to kill it and drain it&apos;s blood out before you&apos;re allowed to eat any animal.
	Blood is not on the menu.

</div>
<p>
	I&apos;m not sure of Yahweh&apos;s logic as to <strong>*why*</strong> we shouldn&apos;t kill our fellow humans, but it looks like killing each other is off the table after all.
	I guess cannibalism isn&apos;t actually allowed.

		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Yahweh just rewrote the laws of physics so that different frequencies of light will now refract differently through a prism, causing raindrops to split light into rainbows when it rains.
	Neat!
	Before this point, rainbows didn&apos;t exist because we were still operating with a different set of physics laws that didn&apos;t allow for rainbows.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">

		<p>

</div>
<p>
	What did I just say about rainbows existing because of light refracting through raindrops?
	Ignore that.
	My bad.
	Rainbows actually come from clouds, and have nothing to do with raindrops.
	Also, every time the sky is covered in clouds, you&apos;ll see a rainbow.
	Every single time.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">

	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Here, Yahweh is still speaking, though for some reason, he switches into third person.
	Maybe it&apos;s a translation error, and Noah is supposed to be speaking here.
	If not, Yahweh needs the rainbow as a reminder to himself that he promised not to flood the world again.
	He can&apos;t just remember that on his own.
	Again, that could just be a translation error.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">

		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Noah and his sons were all told to be fruitful and multiply, but I guess Noah decided not to because he&apos;d already multiplied before being told to?
	Here, it says everyone descends from the three sons that existed prior to the flood.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 9:20 - 9:27</cite>

		<p>
			Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.
		</p>
		<p>
			He drank of the wine and got drunk.
			He was uncovered within his tent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father.
			Their faces were backwards, and they didn&apos;t see their father&apos;s nakedness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			He said,
			&quot;Canaan is cursed.
			He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			He said,
			&quot;Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.
			Let Canaan be his servant.
		</p>
		<p>
			May God enlarge Japheth.
			Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.
			Let Canaan be his servant.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	First of all, what did the youngest son do that was so bad?
	I&apos;m not sure which of the three is the youngest, but Ham accidentally saw his father naked after the father had gotten drunk and stripped off his clothing.
	It sounds like their father passed out drunk, too.
	Shem and Japheth came in, didn&apos;t look, and covered up their father so no one would see him nude.
	What is Noah so angry about?
</p>
<p>
	So Canaan, who wasn&apos;t even involved in this, gets cursed to be the servant of his brothers.
	No brothers are mentioned, but that doesn&apos;t mean he doesn&apos;t have any.
	But then Canaan is also cursed to be the servant of his uncles, Shem and Japheth?
	I&apos;m very confused as to what&apos;s going on here.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 10:2 - 10:5</cite>

		</p>
		<p>
			The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

		<p>
			Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	I don&apos;t quite understand the wording here.
	Is it saying that each island went to one of these people and their families, and that each family had its own language?
	Why were they all speaking different languages?
	A great flood just wiped everyone out, save for four people that were related by blood and four more that were related to the first four by marriage.
	Japheth was one of these eight people, and the rest of the people listed are listed as some of Japheth&apos;s descendants.
	Where are these other languages coming from?
	And I&apos;ll remind you that the Tower of Babel hadn&apos;t happened yet.
	The languages had not yet been confounded by Yahweh.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 11:1</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>

</div>
<p>
	Just a bit ago, the claim was made that each island nation had its own language, which made no sense, as they all descended from Noah and thus should have had the same language.
	This passage contradicts the passage claiming multiple languages, but makes more sense to the story.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 11:2 - 11:8</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>

			They stopped building the city.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Um.
	Okay.
	So the people start building this tower.
	They want to make a name for themselves, and figure what better way than to build a really tall tower.
	I mean, what an impressive feat, right?
	They&apos;re minding their own business though, not hurting anyone.
	But Yahweh&apos;s not having any of that.
	People working together to accomplish impressive feats?
	Nuh-uh.
	Yahweh&apos;s not cool with that kind of behaviour.
	So he messes them up by inventing new languages and changing the people&apos;s brains so each person speaks a different language and they can&apos;t understand each other well enough to work together any more.
	Then for good measure, he scatters them across the earth so they can&apos;t build their city and it&apos;s impressive tower.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Genesis 11:9</cite>
	<blockquote>

	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Oh, and did I mention that this was the story of the Tower of Babel?
	Because it is.
	I was always told that the people of Babel were trying to build a tower tall enough to break into heaven.
	They wanted to get into heaven without needing Yahweh&apos;s permission and without dying first.
	But no.
	That&apos;s not even what&apos;s going on in this story.
	The people just wanted to build an impressive tower.
	They probably didn&apos;t even think heaven was up there.
	I mean, where <strong>*is*</strong> heaven, anyway?
	You&apos;ve got to remember that up above the sky is just a vast body of water, according to this religion.
	The people aren&apos;t going to want to actually get above the sky; they drown.

		</p>
		<p>
			It will happen that when the Egyptians see you, they will say,
			&apos;This is his wife.&apos;
			They will kill me, but they will save you alive.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
		</p>
		<p>
			The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh&apos;s house.
		</p>
		<p>
			He dealt well with Abram for her sake.
			He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram&apos;s wife.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pharaoh called Abram and said,
			&quot;What is this that you have done to me?
			Why didn&apos;t you tell me that she was your wife?
		</p>
		<p>
			Why did you say,
			&apos;She is my sister,&apos; so that I took her to be my wife?
			Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.&quot;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	This part&apos;s a little confusing to me.
	In particular, the wording on 12:16 is odd.
	Did Abram just sell his wife to the pharaoh?
	Because that&apos;s what it looks like just happened.
	Then Yahweh sends plagues to the pharaoh for taking Sarai as a wife, even though he had no idea that she was already married.
	Why did he not instead send plagues to Abram for selling his wife?
	Or to Sarai for marrying the pharaoh even though she was already married?
	None of this makes any sense.
</p>
<p>
	Also of note in 12:16, why are the male servants and male donkeys listed as separate items than the female servants and female donkeys?
	Why does this passage not just say servants and donkeys, not specifying their sex?
	The sheep, cattle, and camels aren&apos;t separated by sex, and in fact, we&apos;re not even told that any of them are of a particular sex.
	This passage is just really strange.
