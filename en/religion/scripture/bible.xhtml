			<h1>The Holy Bible</h1>
			<p>The supposed word of Yahweh</p>
		</header>
<p>
	Mostly, I&apos;m studying the Book of Mormon at the moment.
	However, in the context of speaking with the Mormon missionaries, I&apos;m needing to look at the bible a bit too.
	As my focus id the Book of Mormon and my notes on the bible are more useful to me in a certain order as I progress, my notes here are very mixed up for the time being.
	When I go through and read the whole bible, I&apos;ll fix the organisation here.
</p>
<h2>2019-03-03</h2>
<h3>Matthew 5</h3>
<p>
	The theme of this chapter is that thoughts are a crime, you should push your beliefs as much as it takes to martyr yourself, and women are to get the short end of the stick in a divorce.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Matthew 5:4</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	We&apos;re told that those who mourn are blessed because they&apos;ll be the ones that&apos;ll be comforted.
	However, those that aren&apos;t mourning don&apos;t even need to be comforted, and feel better than those that mourn and are comforted.
	Are those in mourning actually any better off?
	No!
	They&apos;re still worse off.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Matthew 5:10 - 5:12</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness&apos; sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
		</p>
		<p>
			Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Um, what?
	This is pretty much encouraging Christians to push their beliefs to the point that they get martyred.
	Like, getting martyred is the goal, not even just collateral damage, as it&apos;ll get you into heaven.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Matthew 5:17 - 5:19</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Don&apos;t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn&apos;t come to destroy, but to fulfill.
		<p>
		</p>
			For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.
		</p>
		<p>
			 Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	All laws set forth in the bible, no matter how stupid, are to be followed to the letter until the end of days.
	This isn&apos;t going to come up this week, but is something I&apos;ll want to keep in mind as I read the full bible.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Matthew 5:22</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to his brother, &quot;Raca!&quot; will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, &quot;You fool!&quot; will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Wow.
	Here, we introduce thought crimes.
	You can&apos;t avoid committing thought crimes though, because you can&apos;t avoid your own thoughts.
	You can avoid acting on your anger and you can try calming yourself after getting angry, but you can&apos;t just avoid getting angry.
	Also, you&apos;re not allowed to call anyone a fool, on penalty of being sent to hell, though this pales in comparison to the thought crime issue because you can actually restrain yourself from saying what you think.
	A god that judges you based on your thoughts though is not a fair or just god at all.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Matthew 5:28</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Again, a thought crime.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Matthew 5:31 - 5:32</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			It was also said, &quot;Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	So if it turns out you aren&apos;t a good match with your spouse, you&apos;d better not divorce.
	While the man will get off Scott-free, any second or later husband of the woman will be committing a crime unto Yahweh, so she&apos;s pretty much going to be alone forever.
	Wow.
	Sexism and a push for keeping miserable marriages all in one.
</p>
<h3>Luke 6</h3>
<p>
	The theme of this chapter is to push your views, but also not to be judgemental of others.
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Luke 6:22 - 6:23</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Again, push your beliefs up to and including as much as it takes for others to torment you.
	Push your beliefs as much as it takes.
	If they mock and exclude you, it means you&apos;re doing it right, and you&apos;ll be rewarded in the afterlife.
	Do as much as you can to push the Christian faith!
</p>
<div class="cited-quotation">
	<cite>Luke 6:37</cite>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Don&apos;t judge, and you won&apos;t be judged.
			Don&apos;t condemn, and you won&apos;t be condemned.
			Set free, and you will be set free. 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	If more Christians listened to this advice, the world would be a lot better off than it is now.
	There&apos;s d be less wars, for example, and marriage quality wouldn&apos;t have been fought against so hard.
	In some parts of the world, gay marriage (and even gay relationships) is <strong>*still*</strong> illegal due to bigoted religious views.
</p>
<h3>Matthew 6</h3>
<p>
	This chapter seems mostly to be about how you shouldn&apos;t try to show off your good deeds, but instead do them is secret, so as to not taint your intent.
	That&apos;s a good sentiment.
	It also claims you shouldn&apos;t worry for the future because everything will work out.
	Heh.
	Yeah.
	Right.
	Everything <strong>*always*</strong> works out.
</p>
<h3>Matthew 7</h3>
<p>
	This chapter&apos;s theme seems to be to avoid hypocrisy, avoid giving things of worth to those that don&apos;t deserve them, and to avoid false prophets.
