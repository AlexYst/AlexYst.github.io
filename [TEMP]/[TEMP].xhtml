	<h2>Unit 3</h2>

		The original setup of the telephone network isn&apos;t at all what I expected.
		Each telephone needing a direct line to each other telephone a person wanted to call ... wires draped over buildings by private citizens ...
		I&apos;ve known the modern telephone system is a mess for over a decade, but I didn&apos;t realise just how much worse it was in the past.
		What if you wanted to be in touch with someone across town?
		You&apos;d need to get permission from everyone in between to drape your wire over their property, and I&apos;m not even sure what you&apos;d do to get your wire across streets.
		Maybe with less regulation in those days (with telephones being so new, I imagine regulations on them hadn&apos;t been established as much yet), makeshift telephone poles owned by private citizens propped wires up enough to let cars pass beneath.
	</p>
	<p>
		The book mentions that people want to check their email and surf the Web on the go, and explains that thus, there&apos;s a growing interest in wireless telephony.
		Telephony though, by definition, does only voice.
		You can&apos;t check your email or surf the Web using telephony.
		In reality, this explains a growing interest in wireless networking, but not a growing interest in wireless telephony.
		There&apos;s a <strong>*huge*</strong> difference.
		It was also interesting to see that the United States, who frequently does things the wrong way, started out doing wireless telephony in a sane way.
		To be specific, we set up a single standard for 1G mobile communication.
		But then, we had to go and allow nonstandardisation in later generations.
		It just goes to show that even on the rare occasion we don&apos;t get things wrong the first time, we try again and make sure to mess things up.
		We&apos;re such a terrible country.
		The fact that most United States citizens settle for noxious postpaid service is pretty stupid too.
		Elsewhere in the world, people don&apos;t take that, and go with better, prepaid options.
		At least the United States <strong>*has*</strong> prepaid options.
		If we didn&apos;t, I&apos;d&apos;ve never even started using a mobile device.
		It was interesting too to learn the meaning of the term &quot;cellular device&quot;.
		The term always seemed strange to me, as I wasn&apos;t sure how mobile devices related to cells.
		I&apos;d previously thought that perhaps it had to do with the structure of the batteries or something.
		Most of the important stuff on technical aspects of mobile device networks aside from directional antennas and <abbr title="Global System for Mobile Communications">GSM</abbr> multiframes were just review for me though.
		I learned most of it when I was trying to figure out how to get an inherently-<abbr title="Global System for Mobile Communications">GSM</abbr> model of device onto a <abbr title="code division multiple access">CDMA</abbr> network.
		Long story short, you can&apos;t do it.
		Back then though, I wasn&apos;t even aware of the competing standards yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hidden nodes and collisions that only affect receivers within range of both transmitters was a new concept to me.
		It makes perfect sense, but isn&apos;t something I&apos;d thought about before.
		Multipath interference is something I hadn&apos;t thought about either.
		The book mentions the need for Wi-Fi transmissions to be encrypted, but there&apos;s a fatal flaw in the encryption system used in modern Wi-Fi.
		Namely, there&apos;s no way to encrypt transmissions without preventing outsiders from using the access point.
		Open Wi-Fi is a valuable resource.
		There should be a way for the Wi-Fi central node to use a different, dynamic encryption key for each user for security, without blocking users that don&apos;t have an initial password.
		Until this problem is solved, my Wi-Fi network will <strong>*always*</strong> remain unencrypted.
		That said though, I&apos;m a <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> user.
		That means all my traffic is behind three (four when using <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>) layers of encryption anyway.
		Wi-Fi level encryption would be a fourth (or fifth) encryption layer, which one could argue is unneeded.
		Perhaps some sort of open Wi-Fi access point with encrypted connections could be set up using the Extensible Authentication Protocol; this would be a hacky workaround for a missing feature though, and not an actual solution.
