	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<p>
		Hello!
		My name is Alexand(er|ra) Yst.
		(The wye in &quot;Yst&quot; is pronounced as a vowel as it would be in the words &quot;cr<strong>yst</strong>al&quot; or &quot;catal<strong>yst</strong>&quot;, though my name often gets mispronounced by others as &quot;Yyst&quot;, with the wye acting as both a consonant and a vowel.)
		I&apos;m a vegan, though I don&apos;t typically bring it up except when it&apos;s relevant, such as this introduction in a course on environmental science.
		I&apos;m vegan purely for sustainability reasons, not because I think that a human eating a cow is magically any less ethical than a fox eating a hare; we all do what we need to to survive.
		I&apos;m a computer science student and a Debian user.
		As of the time of writing this, I&apos;m currently completing my coursework on a Debian 9 laptop known as <a href="https://y.st./en/domains/bailey.local.xhtml"><code>bailey</code></a>.
		I keep a daily journal on <a href="https://y.st./">my website</a>, though at present, the link to it&apos;s a bit hidden; not that it matters much, due to the current censorship imposed on me and the site resulting in most of my journal pages being redacted until 2023.
		When I&apos;m not doing coursework, I&apos;m often programming mods for a game I enjoy called <a href="https://www.minetest.net/">Minetest</a>.
		It&apos;s an open-ended sandbox building game that, as of the last major revision, gets the entirety of its content through mods, allowing for a variety of gameplay styles.
		Even the default content is just added via bundled mods and can be removed by any player looking for something different.
		I&apos;ve hit a bit of a creative block at the moment though, due to the enormous size of my current project; I&apos;ve had to discontinue this project four times in the past because it&apos;s been too much for me, but this time I hope my new strategy will let me incrementally reach the goal.
		I&apos;m nonbinary in gender, making me a queer; hence why I&apos;m Alex or Alexand(er|ra), and not Alexander or Alexandra.
		I enjoy music, with my current favourite artists being <a href="https://professorshyguy.bandcamp.com/">Professor Shyguy</a> and <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/">Lorenzo&apos;s Music</a>.
		I&apos;ll give anything a listen though as long as it&apos;s covered by a <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution">CC BY</abbr> or <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr> license.
		I like to draw pixel art sometimes, though I&apos;m not particularly good at it.
		While I tend to be a very happy person, I always seem to have an <strong>*extremely morbid*</strong> view of things.
		For example, while it&apos;s true that one reason I&apos;ll never have children is because there&apos;s already such an overpopulation problem as it is without my adding to it, that&apos;s only one of a multitude of reasons.
		Another is that everyone dies.
		By creating a life, I&apos;d be sentencing that life to one day die, and once dead, everything they are is just gone forever.
		So what&apos;s the point in even coming to life?
		How could I do that to someone I&apos;m supposed to grow to <strong>*love*</strong>?
		That&apos;s not a burden I care to take on; the most loving thing I could do for my children is to not create them.
		(And yes, while I very much don&apos;t want my life to end, I find it extremely selfish of my parents for having created me in the first place, especially given their genetic issues that now I&apos;ve got to deal with.
		Again, I won&apos;t make the same mistake.
		I won&apos;t pass on my genetic flaws.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Why did I take this course?
		The short answer is that we&apos;re required to take <span title="Biology 1 for Health Studies Majors">BIOL 1121</span>, <span title="Introduction to Biology">BIOL 1301</span>, or <span title="Introduction to Environmental Science">ENVS 1301</span>.
		I had to pick one.
		To be honest, these questions of why we chose to take a given course make no sense in required courses, though I&apos;ve seen the question in several courses and so far have taken nothing but that which has been required of me.
		I&apos;ll complete my chosen courses, the electives, dead last.
		It was actually a tough decision though for this course, as I think I&apos;d be quite interested to take one of the biology courses and learn a bit more about how I myself function.
		However, in the end, I had to choose the course on environmental science, this course, as understanding how to better care for our planet is much more important than fulfilling some idle curiosity about how I personally operate.
		Compared to the planet, I&apos;m not really going to last very long, am I?
		(And there I go with the morbidity again.)
		Hopefully, I&apos;ll learn something helpful in reducing my personal negative impact on the planet, or even something to help have a positive impact.
		If I learn something of that nature, and I think I likely will, I won&apos;t regret having chosen this course over a biology one.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my area, we have too much formaldehyde in our air, which is toxic.
		I don&apos;t know of any major efforts to fix this, but we do have a &quot;smoke-free Oregon&quot; campaign going on here.
		The formaldehyde likely comes from people smoking cigarettes, so if successful, this should reduce the amount of formaldehyde in the air.
		The people in my area also don&apos;t handle waste properly.
		I don&apos;t know of anything going on to fix this, and in fact, it&apos;s getting worse.
		Our recycling centres aren&apos;t taking as many recyclables as they used to, resulting in more types of plastics being simply sent to landfills.
		My understanding is that we used to sell our recyclables to China, who is no longer taking them, and we don&apos;t have the local facilities we need to do it ourselves.
		Our rivers are also polluted, and I know of no efforts being made to correct this.
	</p>
	<p>
		Choosing a small project to implement is difficult.
		We need proper recycling facilities in the area, but that definitely constitutes a large project.
		I suppose the best small project for my area would be one of education.
		If we can get the locals to understand (and care about) the environmental issues in the area, we can more easily work toward change.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of this week&apos;s reading material was review for me.
		However, one thing I did learn about is buffers.
		Sadly, these weren&apos;t covered in-depth, so I&apos;m probably going to look into them further on my own when I have time.
		They balance <abbr title="potential of hydrogen">pH</abbr> by combining with excess H+ or OH-, but it looks like each buffer is only able to combine with one or the other.
		So how does it differ from an acid or a base (alkaline)?
		Why does it not throw off the balance by combining with too much of the H+ or OH- like an acid or base would?
		These are things I want to look into later.
