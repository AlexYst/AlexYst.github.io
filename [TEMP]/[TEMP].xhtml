	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<p>
		The learning journal assignment for the week asks us where databases are used in our own lives, meaning we should talk from our own experience, not use references.
		However, we&apos;re also told to include citations, which requires that we not discuss what&apos;s going on in our own lives, but instead get our information from another source.
		As you can see, these two instructions are contradictory to one another and following them is mutually exclusive.
		At first, I considered discussing the database locations covered by the book but filtering out the ones that don&apos;t have a presence in my life.
		I would then have a source to cite, yet what I write would still apply to my life as requested.
		For example, one area databases are mentioned as being used is in keeping track of telephone calls made, generating monthly bills for telephone service, and keeping track of balances on prepaid telephone cards.
		I don&apos;t have telephone service though.
		I live telephone free, and it&apos;s fantastic.
		I highly recommend it.
		Another purpose for which databases are said to be used is for aeroplane flight schedules.
		I don&apos;t fly anywhere though.
		Both of these highly-prevalent databases would be omitted from discussion if I were to filter what the textbook covered through the lens of relevancy to my own life.
		That seems more like an oversight than an aid to learning, though.
		With that in mind, I&apos;ll discuss where databases can be found using citations, regardless of whether said databases have a place in my own life.
	</p>
	<p>
		Financial institutions use databases to store accounts, loans, and transaction information <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		The textbook mentions banks, but all of this applies to credit unions as well.
		Additionally, the textbook mentions storing credit card transactions - a subset of transactions in general - in databases, as well as generating monthly bills using said databases <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		Reservations and schedules can be stored in databases.
		The textbook specifically mentions that airlines do this <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>, but it applies to other fields as well.
		For example, if you make an appointment with a medical professional, there&apos;s a good chance they keep track of said appointment via a database.
		I know every medical professional I can remember dealing with does this.
		For that matter, the account information mentioned as being used by banks also applies to a wide array of other businesses, each of which keeps an account with your name on it, including your doctors&apos; office.
		Universities keep accounts for students as well, which include information on registered and past courses in addition to grades.
		As mentioned above, telephone companies keep records on their customers as well.
		They track calls made, calls taken, and current (and often past) account balances.
		As can easily be predicted, they use this data for generating their monthly bills.
		They also use databases to store information about the status of their own network <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		Stocks and bonds are dealt with via databases as well <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		These are intangible concepts that really can&apos;t exist outside some sort of representation, such as a database.
		Many businesses of all sectors store customer information (when they can get their grubby mitts on it) as well as transactional information <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		Factories and warehouses use databases to track inventories, as well as information about products such as supply chains and orders.
		Employee information tends to be stored in databases too.
		This includes mostly information needed for generating pay cheques, such as salaries, wages, and hours worked, but also includes information on employee benefits, if any <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to databases being widely present in the world, they&apos;re also interacted with by nearly everyone in first-world countries.
		<abbr title="automated teller machine">ATM</abbr>s allow a user to make transactions without requiring a live teller to interact with the database on their behalf <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		For that matter, many types of transactions within an account (such as moving money between sub-accounts) can also be done via a Web interface.
		For that matter, all sorts of database interactions occur over the Web.
		Even noxious tracking of your browsing habits done by companies so they can more-effectively pester you with relevant advertisements is an interaction between you and databases <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>, albeit an unwanted interaction.
		(I recommend installing <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>, from the <abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr>.)
		Likewise, those annoying automated telephone systems where you hit all the numbered keys to perform different tasks are database interfaces as well <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basically, what it comes down to is this: organisations use databases to do database things.
		So to understand where databases are used, we need to understand what databases are good at, so we can know what &quot;database things&quot; are.
		When data is being gathered, it&apos;s usually getting stored in a database.
		Likewise, when data needs to be updatable, the data gets put in a database.
		The alternative (besides pen and paper or monolithic plain text files that have to be searched by hand; both of which technically qualify as databases, just not what we traditionally think of as databases these days) is to hard-code the data into the program.
		That&apos;s not feasible when data needs to be updatable.
		As for when data needs to be gathered, it&apos;s outright impossible in most cases.
		To add data to a system using hard-coding, you need a programmer on duty.
		Keeping a programmer on-duty at all times can be expensive, not to mention that such hard-coding of the data becomes tedious very quickly.
		The programmer&apos;s probably just going to program you a database and throw away the hard-coding.
		Databases allow for ever-changing data without the need to reprogram the system each time something is altered.

	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
	<p>
		The focus of this week&apos;s learning journal assignment is Microsoft-based backup and recovery software.
		I&apos;m confused as to why the qualifier though.
		Why does it need to be Microsoft-based?
		There&apos;s plenty of backup and recovery software that has nothing to do with Microsoft.
		Backup and recovery isn&apos;t a Microsoft-specific issue.
		There&apos;s no value in pretending this is a Microsoft-specific topic.
		And that&apos;s just the thing.
		The assignment asks us to talk about one we&apos;ve used in our own lives.
		I&apos;ve always found Windows to be insufferable, so I&apos;ve never used it long enough to even need to back anything up.
		I used to be an OS X user until I found Linux, though I always performed backups on OS X by hand.
		The only backup and recovery software I&apos;ve ever used has been on Linux.
		DÃ©jÃ  Dup was the one I used first.
		It allowed for automated, periodic, incremental backups, which was nice, and had a graphical interface.
		More recently, I&apos;ve had experience with <code>rsync</code>, a command line utility that allows for easy backup of files to another drive or (when combiled with other tools) across a networks.
		I have absolutely zero experience with any Microsoft-based backup utility of any kind, so I can&apos;t discuss my experience with any Microsoft-based backup utility.
		And I don&apos;t have access to a Windows system to experiment with just for the for the purposes of this assignment.
		My only choice is to instead discuss my experience with a Linux-based backup/restore utility.
	</p>
	<p>
		(It&apos;s worth noting that the learning journal assignment says we can discuss a Microsoft-based backup/restore utility from &quot;one of the websites&quot;, but it doesn&apos;t even tell us what websites it&apos;s even referring to.
		The only assigned reading material for the week was in the textbook hosted on the university&apos;s own website, which didn&apos;t mention Windows backup/restore options and didn&apos;t mention other websites.)
	</p>
	<p>
		As I said, I got my start with backups with DÃ©jÃ  Dup.
		I had a home server at the time, so I was able to use DÃ©jÃ  Dup to schedule automated backups so I never had to worry about forgetting to periodically back up all my data.
		I found though that in order to avoid having to back up modified files in their entirety, DÃ©jÃ  Dup stored backups each in their own file, rather than as directory subtrees as one might expect.
		This made it so I couldn&apos;t really go through old copies of my data outside of DÃ©jÃ  Dup.
		I also had no easy way to delete old backups that I no longer needed, because the newer backups were incremental and depended on the data present in the old backups.
		DÃ©jÃ  Dup can delete older backups if you configure it to, but I&apos;m not comfortable with my data getting erased without manual decision.
		Overall, it just wasn&apos;t a good solution for my use case.
	</p>
	<p>
		As mentioned previously, I&apos;ve also use <code>rsync</code> for backing up files.
		I had an account on a server that allowed me only <abbr title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</abbr> access.
		I used <abbr title="Secure Shell Filesystem">SSHFS</abbr> to mount the remote partition to my local file system over <abbr title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</abbr>, then used <code>rsync</code> to copy my files over to the mounted partition.
		The convenient thing about using <code>rsync</code> for this was the <code>--update</code> flag.
		It allowed me to only send over the new files.
		On that particular server, I didn&apos;t keep copies of older backups, so I only needed to transfer over files that were new or had been modified.
		There was a bit of an issue with timestamps too, or so the server administrator and I thought, so I ended up using the <code>--checksum</code> flag as well, so files were checked by checksum rather than by modification timestamp.
		I later found out that many of the files I was sending over were legitimately being modified without my knowledge by one of my scripts though, and modified the script to correct the behaviour.
		The <code>--delete</code> flag was rather useful too, as it prevented files from lingering in the backup once I&apos;d removed them locally.
	</p>
	<p>
		These days, I don&apos;t have a home Internet connection any more, so I&apos;m not able to get my home server set up properly.
		As such, automated backups aren&apos;t possible.
		Instead, I have to manually instantiate a backup every once in a while.
		I probably should use <code>rsync</code> for this, but instead, I just use a manual drag-and-drop to my external hard drive.
		It&apos;s just simpler.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m unclear on exactly what the learning journal assignment means by a Microsoft-based backup/restore utility.
		If it means software actually written by Microsoft, this is an incredibly narrow scope, and I&apos;m not sure how many students taking this course actually have experience with said software.
		However, if it&apos;s instead meant any backup/restore utility that runs on Microsoft&apos;s operating system, Microsoft Windows, <code>rsync</code> actually technically qualifies.
		I&apos;ve never used it on Windows, as I don&apos;t use Windows, but the <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/download.html"><code>rsync</code> website</a> says that <code>rsync</code> is available as a component in the <a href="https://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> suite.
		Cygwin is a collection of Linux command line tools that have been retooled to instead run natively on Windows.
		That means you can use <code>rsync</code> natively on Windows to back up and/or restore your files.

		E-commerce is simply the carrying out of commerce-related activities over the Web <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		I thought it was specifically the purchasing of things over the Web, but it&apos;s not.
		Getting information on products via the Web is also e-commerce.
		For example, when I recently looked into <abbr title="light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation">laser</abbr> hair removal, that was e-commerce, even though I didn&apos;t buy it over the Web.
		I visited several companies&apos; websites for more information, but I pay using cash in person at my appointments.
		I don&apos;t use a whole lot of e-commerce websites though.
		For the most part, I try to save as much as I feasibly can, which means doing very little shopping, either online or offline.
		The main things I need to pay for are rent, electricity, and groceries, all of which I pay for in person, not online.
		I don&apos;t look into products much even, as I know I&apos;m not going to buy them.
		I don&apos;t even pay my tuition here at this university through the e-commerce portion of the website, due to the only way to do that being via PayPal.
		I always have horrid experiences when I try to use PayPal; PayPal has even locked up my credit card in the past.
		So instead, I mail a cashier&apos;s cheque to the school to pay tuition.
		It costs me a little extra, because I have to buy an envelope and postage, but it lets me bypass the PayPal requirement.
		That said, while I pay via post, I do get the services I pay for via the Web.
		So maybe that&apos;s still e-commerce?
		There are a few e-shops I use though, and every once in a while, I research a product I&apos;ve been thinking about getting.
		The main e-commerce website I use, though the one I use least often, would be the <a href="https://www.nic.st/"><code>st</code> domain name registry</a>.
		I dropped a pretty thick stack of cash there years ago in order to claim the domain <code>y.st.</code>, which I use for my <a href="https://y.st./en/">my website</a>.
		Now I go back every once in a while to pay upkeep on the domain, which is much cheaper.
		I looked into every <abbr title="country code top-level domain">ccTLD</abbr> registry in existence before choosing the <code>st</code> registry, so that was e-commerce too, as I was doing research on a product (domains) that I wanted to buy.
		Another e-commerce website I use is <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>.
		Bandcamp sells music, and has two features that makes me choose it over other music-selling websites.
		As you can tell from <a href="https://bandcamp.com/alex_yst">my account</a>, I&apos;ve bought a lot of music over the years.
		First and foremost, it allows artists to release their work under Creative Commons licenses.
		Most artists choose not to do this, but I simply choose not to buy music by those artists.
		I only by music under the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution">CC BY</abbr> and <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike">CC BY-SA</abbr> licenses, so having a shop that sells it is really nice for me.
		Bandcamp also allows your purchases to be downloaded in a variety of formats, including several formats other sites don&apos;t offer.
		I like Ogg Vorbis format for use on my player, and I also download in the lossless <abbr title="Free Lossless Audio Codec">FLAC</abbr> format for the archive on my external hard drive.
		I might not ever use the lossless files, but it&apos;s nice to know I have them if I ever decide I want them for some reason.
		A long time ago, I also bought a huge bundle of music by Josh Woodward from <a href="https://www.joshwoodward.com/">Josh Woodward</a>&apos;s own website.
		Over two hundred <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution">CC BY</abbr>-licensed songs for only $40 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr>!?
		Sign me up!
		He&apos;s really cut down on the number of purchasing options these days.
		It used to be that you could buy either his whole collection at a discounted rate, any individual album, and I think even any individual song.
		Now he only sells his collection as a whole.
		You can still download individual songs gratis though, and to get a single album, you can download each song from the album individually.
		Downloading songs without paying for them was always an option there though, even when he allowed purchasing single albums.
		I don&apos;t know why he doesn&apos;t allow such purchases any more.
		When I need to get my final exams proctored, I bike to a university in the next city over.
		There, they&apos;ve got a testing centre you can pay to have exams proctored in.
		I&apos;ve got to go there in person, but if I pay by credit card, they have me pay via their e-commerce website.
		This is my final proctored term though.
		I&apos;ll need to go there one last time to have my exam for this course and the other one I&apos;m taking right now proctored, but after that, I won&apos;t need a proctor any more and won&apos;t be going back to the testing centre&apos;s e-commerce website.
		I use other e-commerce websites on rare occasion, but none that are worth mentioning.

	<h2>Unit 4</h2>
	<p>
		The main access control method I interact with is the permission system on my computer&apos;s filesystem.
		I&apos;m allowed to edit my own files all I like, but I&apos;m unable to modify system files unless I use the <code>root</code> account to do so.
		Even though I&apos;m the only user on this computer (well, the only human user; the system has a plethora of user accounts that it uses for various purposes), it&apos;s very helpful to be locked out of modifying system files most of the time.
		I&apos;m on Debian these days, but I used to be an Ubuntu user.
		Back when I was on Ubuntu, I kept getting what I think were probably viruses.
		The system would just suddenly prompt me for the administrative password out of the blue.
		I think the viruses were trying to access system files, but because they were forced to run under my unprivileged account, they had to trick me into giving them access to the administrative account if they were to do any real damage.
		I never fell for it, and when that would happen, I would back up my data and reinstall the system, wiping out everything, including the virus.
		It was a heavy-handed approach, but it worked.
		The virus would be gone and I wouldn&apos;t see any further problems until I managed to get another virus.
		I&apos;m still not sure what I was doing to get the viruses in the first place though.
		When I switched to a better operating system though, Debian, the viruses left me alone for good.
		Debian and Ubuntu are pretty similar though, so I would have thought that they&apos;d be susceptible to the same viruses.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, the <abbr title="fourth extended filesystem">ext4</abbr> filesystem&apos;s access control is pretty simple an easy to understand.
		Each file, including directories, is tagged with both a username and a group name.
		There are then three permission levels for the file: the specific named user, everyone that isn&apos;t the specifically-named user but is in the named group, and everyone else.
		For each level, there are three permissions: read permission, write permission, and execute permission.
		If you don&apos;t have the required permission, you can&apos;t perform the action you&apos;d like to.
		For example, the viruses were probably trying to write to system files or add files to system directories, which would require the write permission.
		The system directories usually specify <code>root</code> as both the user and the group, and deny the write permission to everyone else.
		A lowly basic user account such as mine doesn&apos;t have the right permission to write to those files, so a virus running under my account doesn&apos;t have the authorisation to write to those files either.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also use an access control system with my computer&apos;s firewall.
		Only one user account on the entire system is allowed to access the network, and that user isn&apos;t me.
		Instead, it&apos;s the user account in which only my proxy software runs under.
		That means that if any of my software tries to make network requests that I don&apos;t know about without going through the proxy, those requests are blocked.
		There&apos;s simply no way around the proxy, which means no data gets leaked outside the proxy.
		Software that behaves itself and uses the proxy I&apos;ve specified is allowed to access the network, while misbehaving software that tries to route around the proxy doesn&apos;t get anywhere.
		This isn&apos;t a traditional use for access control, but it&apos;s been highly effective for my use case.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s also been claimed by our textbook that when you use a webpage that uses a database as a back end, you&apos;re using that database (Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001).
		Personally, I think this is a stretch.
		You&apos;re not the database user, as far as I&apos;m concerned, the people who set up the the page are the database users.
		By the book&apos;s definition though, I&apos;m also a user of the university&apos;s database.
		Semantics and technicalities aside, whether or not I&apos;m actually a user of the database, access control is still relevant to me.
		Rather than being applied to database accounts though, it&apos;s applied to website user accounts.
		For example, when I make a post at this school, I&apos;m able to edit it for up to five minutes.
		The access control allows me access to the edit feature for that specific period of time, but them locks me out of that feature.
		Furthermore, the site locks me out of editing the posts of others altogether.
		I&apos;m simply not allowed to edit the posts of my professors nor my classmates even within the five-minute span.
		But if I had to guess, I&apos;d say that <strong>*someone*</strong> is allowed to edit all the posts.
		In theory, there&apos;s some Web-based administrative account that&apos;s free to edit any content the user likes.
		(If not though, there&apos;s always the accounts in the database, and the administrative account <strong>*there*</strong> certainly can edit anything in the tables.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Another access control system I deal with is the one at my work.
		Different users are granted different permissions.
		The cash registers are connected to the computer system, and the base user level allows you to use a register that has been checked out to you.
		These users aren&apos;t allowed to perform cash drops or void orders though, for example.
		A while back, the head manager gave me the assistant manager group permission though, which among other things, allows the user to perform cash drops.
		I&apos;m not actually a head manager, but the head manager got tired of dropping what they were doing to go perform a cash drop whenever the registers would lock up and demand one, so they gave a few of us that they trust more than the rest the assistant manager group permission so we could perform our own drops and save them some time.
		I don&apos;t have many details on how this permission system works, but it locks options that we&apos;re not allowed to use.
		With the assistant manager permission though, I&apos;m able to access just about everything.
		I don&apos;t actually care enough to see what can be done though.
		On top of the regular stuff everyone can access, the only things I do are perform cash drops and void erroneous orders (for example, if a customer changes their mind about buying something after I&apos;ve already finalised the order), both of which would have to be done anyway, but I&apos;d otherwise have to go get a manager to do for me.
