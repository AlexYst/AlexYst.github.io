<h2>The scientific method</h2>
<p>
	Sources differ as to the exact steps of the scientific method, even sometimes differing as to how many steps it has.
	The basic idea is always the same though.
	For the purposes of this assignment, I&apos;ll refer to the steps suggested by the textbook.
	According to our textbook, the steps of the scientific method are as follows (Little et al, 2014):
</p>
<ol start="0">
	<li>
		Pose a question
	</li>
	<li>
		Research the topic
	</li>
	<li>
		Form a hypothesis
	</li>
	<li>
		Plan and perform a study
	</li>
	<li>
		Draw conclusions
	</li>
	<li>
		Report your findings
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>Beginning the process</h2>
<h3>The question</h3>
<p>
	The question I would like to pose: What societal benefits can we achieve through using free software and free culture as opposed to proprietary alternatives?
	It&apos;s important - in order to understand the topic - what free software and free culture even are.
	In English, the word &quot;free&quot; is often used as a bastardisation of the phrase &quot;free of charge&quot;, which means &quot;unencumbered by a fee&quot;.
	Free software isn&apos;t always free of charge though.
	This isn&apos;t what the word &quot;free&quot; means in this context.
	Instead, it refers to &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;unencumbered&quot;.
	You are free to use such software in any way you choose, you&apos;re free to modify it, and you&apos;re free to distribute modified or unmodified copies of the software.
	You&apos;re even allowed to sell copies of the software, should you choose so.
	Many groups keep more-detailed specifications as to exactly what free software is and isn&apos;t.
	Personally, I tend to look to point people looking for a detailed description to the <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a> (Debian, 2020) due to Debian&apos;s consistent use of the term &quot;free&quot; for all works and not just those written in code.
	Certain other groups claim some works to be free even with certain freedoms to be stifled that they wouldn&apos;t normally allow just because of a particular form the work happens to take; for example, they might claim that a work that disallows modifications is still somehow &quot;free&quot; because it&apos;s a document or an image and not software.
	Similarly, free culture is cultural works that allow you to derive and redistribute as you see fit.
</p>
<h3>Researching</h3>
<p>
	It&apos;s difficult to find good resources for this sort of question.
	Some resources are too shady to site, while others are written by the authors of Wikipedia, which people get wiggy if you try to cite, even when valid points are made in the articles.
	Wikipedia cites sources, but the relevant ones from their articles are broken links; the initial articles have been moved or removed.
	I was able to find a few good articles I&apos;d like to read though.
</p>
<p>
	Society and our creations are all derived from what came before us.
	We don&apos;t create in a vacuum.
	We take bits and pieces from things others made before us.
	We should be allowed to do so, and others should be allowed to build off of our works in turn.
	Without such derivatives, society stagnates.
	Without copyright/patent laws, we&apos;d be more advanced as a society, as we wouldn&apos;t have to not create things simply because they included elements that are illegal to reproduce.
	One thing I would want to find out in a study conducted would be how much society has been held back by such laws, though this seems like an impossible task, given that we can&apos;t actually see where the world would be had copyright law and patent law not been enacted.
	It&apos;s a sort of alternate-world scenario that we can only speculate on.
	In light of that, what I&apos;d want the study to demonstrate would be several specific examples of situations in which some new invention had to not be produced due to patent law or some book, image, or other artistic work were unable to be produced and/or released due to copyright law.
	Furthermore, the effect of patent/copyright laws on causing software-related issues could be covered; examples of this include format incompatibilities, where a piece of software isn&apos;t allowed to be made compatible with another or with a file format.

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>
	My hypothesis is that we would live in a better world if we all just learned to derive and let derive.
	The idea that ideas are somehow property is ludicrous and outright toxic.
	Even the way most people speak reeks of this mindset.
	For example, Person A might say that Person B &quot;stole&quot; their idea.
	However, ideas aren&apos;t property and cannot be stolen.
	When something is stolen, the victim no longer has it.
	However, in this case, both Person A and Person B now have the same idea.
	They both know the idea now, meaning that the idea was never stolen, but instead, was merely copied.

<h2>Letter</h2>
<p>
	Hello [insert organisation here],
</p>
<p>
	In regards to the study we propose, it is our intent to conduct field research as to the negative effects of the restriction of the use and reproduction of information, including both software and cultural works.
	This will include conducting interviews with artists using various mediums as well as companies and developers impacted by such monopoly-inducing restrictions.
	We hope to uncover previously-unknown examples of of technology and works of art that have been denied to society because of copyright and patent law, demonstrating that copyright and patent law don&apos;t &quot;protect&quot; innovation and cration, but instead serve to stifle them.
</p>
<p>
	Companies are already aware of this, but enjoy the monopolies they hold.
	We can&apos;t expect actual change until these problems are made common knowledge to the layperson.
</p>
<p>
	Kind regards,<br/>
