		The submission form isn&apos;t allowing me to submit my answers in a text box like usual, so I wasn&apos;t able to post my response correctly.
		Instead I had to upload it as a file.
		I apologise for the inconvenience of having to download this attachment instead of simply being able to read it on the website like usual.
		Additionally, pasting the submission into a document like this removed all my formatting, including my headers and my <code>&lt;abbr/&gt;</code> tags, making it slightly harder to read.
		Again, I apologise for the inconvenience.
	</p>
	<h3>Polymer examples</h3>
	<p>
		An example of a carbohydrate would be amylopectin.
		This polymer is composed of glucose monomers linked by glycosidic bonds, and is used by plants for energy storage.
		Plant-eating animals, including humans, use this polymer as a source of energy intake.
		It has a chemical formula of C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>52</sub>O<sub>26</sub>.
	</p>
	<p>
		An example of a lipid would be cholesterol.
		It&apos;s formed by combining hydrocarbons using dehydration synthesis.
		Like other lipids, cholesterol is hydrophobic, so it doesn&apos;t easily interact with water.
		What&apos;s interesting about cholesterol is that it acts as a base for building other useful things, such as testosterone, estradiol, vitamin D, and bile salts.
	</p>
	<p>
		An example of a protein would be hemoglobin.
		This molecule is most known for its presence in blood, where it helps transport things throughout the body.
		Of interesting note, sickle cell anaemia is caused by a mutated gene that causes a single one of the about six hundred amino acids to be replaced by an incorrect one.
		That one incorrect protein makes a huge difference, an example of how fine-tuned our evolution seems to be in some regards and how fragile we really are.
		Like other proteins, hemoglobin is a chain of sequential amino acids bonded with peptide bonds.
	</p>
	<p>
		An example of a nucleic acid is deoxyribonucleic acid.
		While I don&apos;t think many people outside the biological study are overly familiar with this term, most people have a rough idea of what this is if given the acronym: <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>.
		<abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> is used to encode genes, and the sequences of the <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> determine which proteins are built and when.
		Like other nucleic acids, they basically act as a set of instructions, but <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> can be thought of as the main copy, with <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> being copied from it, and those copies being used to synthesise the proteins.
		<abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> isn&apos;t directly responsible for protein synthesis itself, but can be thought of as delegating to the produced <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr>.
