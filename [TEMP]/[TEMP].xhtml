<h2>Part A: <a href="http://aispace.org/exercises/exercise6-a-1.shtml">Questions and answers</a></h2>
<h3>Describe the difference between marginal independence and conditional independence.</h3>
<p>
	If the probability of an even given <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> is equal to the probability given just <var>x</var>, the event is marginally independent on <var>y</var>.
	On the other hand, if the probability of the even given <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> is only equal the probability of the even given only <var>x</var> for a specific result, but not for other results, the event is conditionally independent on <var>y</var>.
</p>
<h3>Why are we more often interested in conditional independence?</h3>
<p>
	Conditional independence is occurs more often, so it&apos;s more relevant.
</p>
<h3>What are the three key components of a belief network?</h3>
<p>
	A directed acyclic graph of the variables, the domains of each of the variables, and a set of probability distributions.
</p>
<h3>What is the independence assumption in a belief network?</h3>
<p>
	Each variable is conditionally independent of non-child variables given the values of its parents.
</p>
<h3>Is cardholderContacted conditionally independent of internationalActivity given fraudAlert? How can you tell from the belief network?</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and the belief network is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>Is fraudAlert conditionally independent of newVendor given internationalActivity? How can you tell from the belief network?</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and the belief network is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>Use the embedded Java applet to examine the probability tables for this problem (right click on nodes). Let&apos;s say you are travelling in Europe and have used your card there several times, and then the card stops working. You check your (perfectly reliable) voicemail and there is no message from the bank. What is the most likely cause for the card being disabled? In other words, what are the probabilities P(overLimit = true), P(fraudAlert = true) and P(cardExpired = true) given the observations?</h3>
<p>

	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>Consider a separate scenario. You are preparing for an overseas trip where you plan to use your credit card, and you want to know how likely it is that using your card abroad will lead to your card being disabled. If it&apos;s a high probability, you should inform your credit card company of your travel plans in advance. Calculate the probability of your card being disabled.</h3>

<h2>Part B: <a href="http://aispace.org/exercises/exercise6-b-1.shtml">Questions and answers</a></h2>
<h3>This Bayes net represents a bicycle squeak diagnostic for determining what might be causing a bicycle to squeak. Right-clicking on a node allows you to examine the probability tables for that node. Do the probabilities seem sensible? In plain English, describe the relationships between the nodes in this Bayes net.</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and required information is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>What are the priors for MouseInSeat? What is the probability of the bike squeaking if MouseInSeat=T?</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and required information is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h2>Part C: <a href="http://aispace.org/exercises/exercise6-c-1.shtml">Questions and answers</a></h2>
<h3>What is a factor?</h3>
<p>
	A factor is a set of values that represents the output of a function given the possible inputs.
</p>
<h3>What are the operations applied to factors in the variable elimination algorithm?</h3>
<p>
	Assigning, adding, and multiplying.
</p>
<h3>What do we mean by the term belief network inference problem?</h3>
<p>
	It&apos;s a type of problem in which you calculate the posterior probability distribution based on the evidence you have.
</p>
<h3>Define elimination ordering.</h3>
<p>
	It&apos;s the order in which variables are eliminated from the problem.
</p>
<h3>What are the three main steps of variable elimination?</h3>
<p>
	Create a factor representing the variable, ignore the non-query variables.
	If the variable is seen, set it to the visible value.
	Otherwise, sum it out.
	Finally, multiply the remaining factors, then normalise the result.
</p>
<h2>Part D: <a href="http://aispace.org/exercises/exercise6-d-1.shtml">Questions and answers</a></h2>
<h3>How does the time complexity of exact inference in a Markov chain depend on the number of time steps?</h3>
<p>
	The time complexity is always linear.
	Markov models, including Markov chains, don&apos;t allow past states besides the most recent to influence the results, keeping the time complexity simple.
</p>
<h3>Open the localization applet and read the decription (sic) of the model. Draw a time-slice of the hidden markov model in the Belief network tool.</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and required information is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>Write the conditional probability tables for the sensing model. Also provide the state probability distribution according to the dynamics model, given that the previous state was position 0 and the previous action was to move right.</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and required information is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>Click &quot;Know Location&quot; to set the prior distribution to a point mass at a random location. Next, &quot;Observe Door&quot; and &quot;No Light&quot;. What happens? Give an intuitive reason for your observation. How might this be a problem in real applications, and how might we solve it?</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and required information is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>Still using the &quot;Know Location&quot; prior, move the robot right twice, then left once. Which locations have a belief probability above the smallest value in the distribution? Why?</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and required information is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h3>Suppose the robot is randomly placed into the world, so that it can be at any location with equal probability (that is, we set a uniform prior). If we now observe a door, what is the probability that we really are at a location with a door? Try solving this both by hand and with the applet, then compare the results.</h3>
<p>
	The required Java applet isn&apos;t loading, and required information is shown only in the applet.
	It&apos;s not possible to answer the question.
</p>
<h2>Part E: <a href="http://aispace.org/exercises/exercise6-e-1.shtml">Questions and answers</a></h2>
<h3>When would approximate inference be preferable to exact inference techniques such as variable elimination?</h3>
<p>
	Approximate inference is preferable when variable elimination is infeasible due to the complexity of the network.
</p>
<h3>You randomly throw 200 darts at a dartboard (the probability of hitting any spot on the dartboard is uniform). The dartboard has two types of regions: red and black. 57 of the darts you threw hit a red region. Approximately what percentage of the dartboard is black?</h3>
<p>
	The percent that is black is equal to the percentage that&apos;s not red.
	To get the red percentage, we divide 57 by two (because two hundred darts were thrown, not one hundred).
	28.5% is red, so 71.5% would have to be black to add up to the full 100%.
</p>
<h3>Suppose you are sampling from a single variable and trying to estimate the probability of a particular value of that variable. Using Hoeffding&apos;s inequality, how many samples would you need in order to get an error of less than 0.05 in 90% of cases?</h3>
<p>
	Plugging in the numbers, we get (-ln(0.1 / 2)) / (2 * 0.05 * 0.05)
	A calculator tells us this is about 599.146454711, and we can&apos;t take only part of a sample, so we need to round up.
	We need 600 samples.
