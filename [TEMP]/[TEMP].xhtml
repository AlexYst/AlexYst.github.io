		The concept of mortality rates is pretty straightforward.
		They get corrected by some relevant denominator, which makes sense and makes the statistic more meaningful.
	</p>
	<p>
		Morbidity rates seem a bit odd, as far as the name goes.
		Why are they called morbidity rates?
		They're a measure of how many people suffer from a given, not-necessarily-potent illness.
		For example, you could measure the morbidity rate of people suffering from the common cold, but the common cold isn't particularly morbid.
	</p>
	<p>
		Measures of functioning are a better assessment of a person's health, I think.
		I think it could use some work, but has the right idea in mind.
		For example, I might end up with a large scrape across my arm.
		I may still be able to perform all daily tasks, so the scrape doesn't alter my measures of functioning, but my quality of life is still lower until it has healed more.
	</p>
	<p>
		The paper on teleheath practices was not what I expected it to be.
		I assumed it'd  talk about how effective it is and how more healthcare providers should provide the option.
		Having &quot;tele&quot; in the name, I assumed the primary remote interactions would be over the telephone, which gave me a bias against the paper before even reading it.
		I understand that the &quot;tele&quot; comes from &quot;telecommunication&quot; and that telephones aren't the only method of telecommunication, but my gut instinct jumps to the negative conclusion in this case.
		I assumed other methods of telecommunication would not be offered to the participants.
		One of my main issues with telephones is the attitude of people that have them.
		They assume that because most people have telephone service, <strong>*everyone*</strong> must have telephone service.
		Many businesses and organisations, both public and private, refuse to serve you  if you don't hand over a telephone number.
		Don't have one?
		Too bad.
		No service for you.
		For example, the <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr> in my state refuses to issue me a drive test, and therefore refuses to issue me a driver license, because I don't have telephone service.
		What kind of idiotic reason is that!?
		So because I don't have a telephone line, I'm not allowed to drive a motor vehicle.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I wasn't wrong that participants in the study were required to engage with their healthcare providers over the telephone, though the main way patients communicated with their doctors via a special monitoring machine instead.
		However, I <strong>*was*</strong> wrong that the study was highly in favour of pushing us toward a future where telephones are the main way we speak with our healthcare providers.
		While some improvement in health was demonstrated, the increase in observed health was <code>*negligible*</code>.
		It could have easily been caused by other factors, and even if it was in fact caused by telephoning the doctor, such negligible results don't justify pushing that setup on everyone.
		And that's not to mention that most of the communication happened over the type of device that could be connected to the Internet for patients that don't have telephone service (though they would need Internet service).
		It simply doesn't make sense to send one of these monitoring stations to everyone's home.
		Many patients wouldn't be able to afford them, and the devices are only able to transmit certain types of health data, making them only useful in very specific circumstances, such as when dealing with a diagnosed chronic illness.
		Those of us that choose to bike down to the doctors' office and make appointments in person, then actually meet our doctors face-to-face on the date of our appointments have nothing to fear from the results of this study.
		In-person care isn't going away any time soon.
