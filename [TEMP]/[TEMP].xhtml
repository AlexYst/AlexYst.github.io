	Because the medical profession in Magda&apos;s country doesn&apos;t recognise depression, it&apos;s likely Magda feels alone and unable to get help.
	She&apos;s been losing interest in things she once found joy in, and committing to social engagements causes her anxiety.
	If she realises she has depression, she knows she doesn&apos;t really have anywhere to turn, which is likely causing her feel even more alone and become even more depressed.
	On the other hand, she more likely doesn&apos;t recognise depression either.
	Personally, I reject many of the key ideas of my own government, as well as key ideas from several industries, including the medical industry.
	I probably don&apos;t understand the extent of how bad my government and the corporations operating with in it are, but I know well enough not to trust their ideas on anything.
	I do research, and if their ideas about something just so happen to be correct, as they are every once in a while, so be it.
	However, most people trust their respective governments and the businesses around them to an extent.
	Magda likely believes depression not to be real and thinks what she feel right now is due to something seriously wrong with her.
	She likely feels embarrassment from this.
	She probably doesn&apos;t even <strong>*consider*</strong> getting help, out of fear of being judged.
	If this is the case, Magda is probably trying to manage her depression on her own, which likely isn&apos;t going to work very well.
	She needs help, and trained medical professionals are usually the best source of it.
	Unfortunately, with the medical profession not recognising depression as being an actual medical condition, her best resource simply doesn&apos;t exist.
</p>
<p>
	However, this really depends on Magda&apos;s support network.
	There&apos;s a chance Magda&apos;s friends and/or family are highly supportive, and don&apos;t buy blindly into what medical professionals in her country would write off.
	With the right support network, if Magda is open with them, she stands a high chance of recovery (Patel, Chew-Graham, Bundy, Kennedy, Blickem, &amp; Reeves, 2015).
	Magda will likely treat her depression problem in much the same way she treats other sorts of problems (Ogden, 2017).
	If she&apos;s the type to turn to her friends and family, and those friends and family are able and willing to provide the support she needs, things will look up for her.
</p>
<p>
	It&apos;s common for mental illnesses such as depression to carry a stigma (Lakeman, McGowan, MacGabhann, Parkinson, Redmond, Sibitz, Stevenson, &amp; Walsh, 2012).
	This stigma is only amplified when healthcare professionals don&apos;t recognise your illness as valid.
	By not recognising your illness as an illness to be treated, they&apos;re instead pushing the idea that these illnesses are instead something broken and unfixable about you.
