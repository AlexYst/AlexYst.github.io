			<h1>Inequality</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	The textbook introduces us to three competing theories that have been proposed to explain global inequality: modernisation theory, dependency theory, and globalisation theory.
	Each has its merits, but has a different explanation as to why inequality between nations might exist.
</p>
<h2>Modernisation theory</h2>
<p>
	Modernisation theory proposes that a lack of modernisation is to blame for the less well-off countries&apos; predicament (Little, 2014).
	It states that the solution is for these countries to engage in further industrialisation efforts, but also to adapt their cultural beliefs, values, and practices to make modernisation a priority.
</p>
<p>
	Critics of this theory point out that this is an abandonment of these countries culture.
	The &quot;solution&quot; to being a poor country, according to this theory, would change who the people of these countries are.
	They&apos;d lose their cultural identity.
</p>
<h2>Dependency theory</h2>
<p>
	Dependency theory states that the inequality between nations is caused by the dependence of less-well-off nations on richer nations (Little, 2014).
	Richer nations are causing the inequality.
	Furthermore, it offers advice to richer nations as to how to make the most of the situation.
	It recommends making sure dependent nations are well-off enough to be healthy and useful to the richer nations, but not so well off that they become wealthy nations themselves and break free of the dependence.
</p>
<h2>Globalisation theory</h2>
<p>
	Globalisation theory states that as markets have expanded and become more open, wealth has now being redistributed on a global scale (Little, 2014).
	It has created rich cities and poor cities, rich nations and poor nations.
</p>
<h2>Which theory holds water in explaining global inequality?</h2>
<p>
	Personally, I think all three are valid.
	At least, all three explain the situation and its causes.
	I&apos;m not sure modernisation is always the solution to things, but we can&apos;t deny the fact that access to things richer countries consider basics - such as water-treatment plants - wouldn&apos;t go a long way.
	There&apos;s a point at which modernisation goes too far, but having a bit of modernisation isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing.
	I think the loss of culture mainly comes in too when culture clashes with better practices.
	For example, if your culture uses big, clay vases to lug large amounts of water out of a nearby river, that practice - and the production of such cultural vases - will halt when people have indoor plumbing.
	This isn&apos;t the bad thing that people make it out to be.
	I&apos;ve also seen dependency theory at work.
	I&apos;ve seen countries exploiting other countries in such a way and basically draining them of resources.
	The only thing I disagree with in this theory is what we should do with the information.
	The theory tries to keep dependant nations dependant by keeping them from becoming too wealthy themselves, and I consider that to be highly exploitive and evil.
	Finally, the effects of globalisation theory are seen any time you&apos;re dealing with major companies that operate internationally.
	I choose not to drop the names of such companies in my writing, but I bet everyone who reads this can name at least half a dozen of such companies without even hardly trying.
</p>
<p>
	So which theory explains what&apos;s going on best?
	They all do.
	They just explain different aspects of the system at play.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	All three theories explain why wealth isn&apos;t distributed well in our world.
	Each tackles a different aspect of the problem, and I&apos;m sure some aspects of the problem aren&apos;t even covered by these theories.
	Human interactions are complex, and they grow even more complex with the more humans involved.
	On a global scale, it&apos;s difficult to look at the entire problem of inequality all at once because of just how complex of a problem it is.
