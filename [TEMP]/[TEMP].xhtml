	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		I dreamed that Summer had dies, and that spirits were real.
		She came back as a ghost and talked to me about her plan for Vanessa.
		She didn&apos;t want to feel unneeded, so she was going to stay away from Vanessa so Vanessa would grow sad and begin to miss her.
		When Vanessa had broken down and could no longer live without Summer, she&apos;d swoop in and come back to her.
		I pointed out that vanessa is strong and would pull through.
		Summer at first agreed, and thought I was saying she&apos;d pull through this hard time and make it to the time she&apos;d have with Summer&apos;s ghost, but then realised that Vanessa doesn&apos;t need Summer, and wouldn&apos;t have the breakdown to begin with.
		Vanishing from Vanessa&apos;s life would make Vanessa need her <strong>*less*</strong>, not more.
		She would cope and learn to live with her new reality.
		Summer&apos;s ghost was already unneeded and always would be.

	<h2>Dietary intake</h2>
	<p>
		For breakfast, I had a bowel of cereal.
		For lunch, I had a small quesadilla and the last of the taco filling I&apos;d been using for soft tacos; a mix of rice and beans.
		For dinner, I planned to have two quesadillas.
		That would have been the last of the tiny tortillas I&apos;m trying to use up.
		Instead, I ended up having one quesadilla and a small smoothie.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomorrow, I&apos;ll have the final quesadilla.
		After that, I&apos;ll be having sandwiches for a while.
		I&apos;ve got a lot of bread in my freezer too, though unlike the tortillas, I actually use loafs of bread somewhat regularly.

	<h2>Bicycle repair</h2>
	<p>
		Late last night, my bicycle mysteriously fell over and made a loud thud.
		When I went to run errands this morning, I found out exactly what that was about.
		The tire was flat.
		Again.
		It was the back one, this time.
		That changed the height of the bicycle in the back, and unfortunately made the bottom of the wheel higher up than the bottom of the kickstand, so the kickstand shoved the bike into a an unbalanced position instead of holding it up, so it fell.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried pumping up the tire.
		The plan was to change the inner tube tomorrow, but just get through the day today.
		I had other things I wanted to get done today besides tire-changing.
		I headed out to return bottles for their deposit, but found the bike not riding very well.
		I checked the back tire, and found it was almost completely flat again.
		I was nowhere near the redemption centre, and it wasn&apos;t holding air long enough for the errand.
		I ended up walking the bike home, which was about nine blocks away.
		It was really easy, but I didn&apos;t like how long it took on foot.
	</p>
	<p>
		So anyway, the tire had to be changed today after all.
		I&apos;ve stripped the final inner tube off one of my scrap bikes.
		I have no more tubes.
		I need to find time to patch all the punctured tubes I&apos;ve got before another one blows on me.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the new tube installed though - as well as a new tire because the old one was looking worn, I have several tires lying around, and the wheel and tire were off already anyway - I got the bottles redeemed and got my tuition payment mailed to the school.
		Now I just have to wait about a month for them to receive it, all the while nagging me repeatedly about paying them when I always get it sent to them within a week of when they request it.
		It just takes a while to get through the mail.
		I can&apos;t help that.

		My discussion posts for the day:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			I don&apos;t think that slogan &quot;Write once, run everywhere.&quot; quite captures just what Java does.
			I mean, one of the projects I follow compiles for many different systems.
			You could say that it was written once and runs everywhere too.
			The thing is though, while it gets written once, it gets <strong>*compiled*</strong> many times.
			And I&apos;m sure there are many other projects just like that.
			I see where they were going with that, but a better and more-accurate slogan for Java would have been &quot;Compile once, run everywhere.&quot;.
			Offering a single executable for all systems is quite a powerful option.
			Not all users know how to or want to compile from source, and some users are so bad with computers that they don&apos;t even know what system they&apos;re on, making it difficult for them to select the right executable to download if you offer a separate version for each system.
		</p>
		<p>
			The graph you provided showing the rise and fall in popularity of various languages is pretty interesting.
			It&apos;s odd to see <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> on the graph though.
			It&apos;s not exactly comparable to the other languages shown in what it can even do.
			It&apos;s so limited that we could of course expect for it never to be the most-popular language; it&apos;s pretty much always got to be used in combination with another language to be useful, adding popularity to whatever other language is used with it in the process.
		</p>

	<blockquote>

			The main even loop isn&apos;t called a loop because it passes control back and forth between the event handlers and the main program.
			If the user never triggered an event, control would never be passed to event handlers, right?
			And yet it&apos;d still be the main event loop, and would still do the looping.
			The main event loop actually loops from its end back to its own beginning.
			Event handlers are dealt with within the loop, but if there are no events, the event handlers are simply skipped over.
			The main event loop is run countless times every second, and is how the program can continue to make progress without getting any closer to terminating.
			Without such a loop, the program would reach its end and finish.
			You couldn&apos;t do anything continuous, such as an interactive graphic rendering, run a Web browser, or even run an operating system.
			All of these things require main event loops in order to keep going forward indefinitely.

		I&apos;ve managed to mine just enough mese to power the rails on segment I&apos;ve already built of the bridge.
		That&apos;s twenty-two mese.
		Even one less and I wouldn&apos;t have been able to install as many rails as it needs.
		I&apos;ll need more mese before I can actually get anywhere though.
		The first stop will be World&apos;s Navel.
		Once I reach World&apos;s Navel, I can decide what direction I want to head out from there.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve also moved my junk, things I&apos;ll absolutely never use, to the underground mushroom garden/underground tunnel.
		The place is practically a basement to my cabin, so I might as wall build chests into the walls and use it as storage as well.
		That allows me to get the useless items out of my main storage.
		Seriously, I&apos;ll never use my flint.
		Flint requires the consumption of steel to use, and steel is far too valuable to waste on tools such as flint-and-steel.
		Flint-and-steel is the <strong>*only*</strong> thing that can be built with flint, and being a tool, it takes wear as you use it, consuming the steel you paired the flint with.
		No thanks.
		But also, fire isn&apos;t something I&apos;d use very often even if it didn&apos;t cost steel to make.
		I&apos;m also storing my harvested mushrooms there.
		The problem with mushrooms is that their 0.4.13 version, which is basically what I&apos;m using, used two separate yet visually-identical nodes to denote mushroom states.
		There&apos;s the ones that can still drop spores and the ones that have already had their chance to drop spores.
		Obviously, I want the ones that can drop stuff in my mushroom garden, but the harvested ones serve no purpose except to - if I place them as decoration or something - trick me into thinking I should harvest them for levelling purposes, even though they won&apos;t help me level.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think I want to build what amounts to a seed repository.
		It&apos;ll be separate from the sand/gravel storage bank I talked about previously.
		That&apos;ll also get the leaves and saplings out of my attic - where my main storage is - a lot sooner.
		It&apos;ll also look nicer, as I want to put it in the hollow of a giant pine tree.
		It&apos;s going to take forever to gather enough resources to build that.
		Just the outer trunk of the tree will take about fourteen stacks of pine trunks.
		I haven&apos;t even taken the time to calculate the amount of wood panelling I&apos;ll need for hte inside or the amount of slow I&apos;ll need to top the thing.
		I guess that tree&apos;ll likely be my next project.
