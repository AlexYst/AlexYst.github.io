			<p>MATH 1302: Discrete Mathematics</p>

<section id="Unit1">
	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<p>
		The reading assignment for the week was Chapters 0.1 through 0.3 of <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/646638/mod_resource/content/2/dmoi-tablet.pdf">Discrete Mathematics - dmoi-tablet.pdf</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This week was pretty much review for me.
		We didn&apos;t cover much that I didn&apos;t already know from past maths courses (not necessarily ones from this school) or from basic intuition.
		I guess the main thing I learned was terminology.
		For example, I&apos;d never heard of a powerset.
		I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve encountered powersets in other courses, either.
		However, I <strong>*have*</strong> worked with them in my code and in problems I&apos;ve solved.
		A great example of this was an alchemy plugin I started building for a game I enjoy.
		The alchemy idea got scrapped and re-planned several times before ultimately being deemed unnecessary, but at one point, it was decided that any number of ingredients from a certain set would be meldable to form new items.
		This included single-item refinements, though didn&apos;t include the empty set.
		Basically, the set of recipes that needed to be defined was the powerset of the list of ingredients minus the empty set.
		I never knew there was a term for this set of sets though.
	</p>
	<p>
		We were asked what information learned was contrary to what we previously believed.
		For me, none of it.
		Maths aren&apos;t exactly a controversial topic.
		I either know something or I don&apos;t.
		Maths are a form of logical thinking.
		I don&apos;t form incorrect opinions on maths because I don&apos;t form opinions on maths.
		When I do maths incorrectly, it&apos;s because I made a mistake, not because I learned some alternate form of maths that are somehow incorrect.
	</p>
	<p>
		One question specifically asked by the learning journal instructions is how the class discussion helped in learning the new information.
		It didn&apos;t.
		Every course I&apos;ve been in at this school has had discussion assignments, and for some students, I&apos;m sure they really help them grasp the information.
		For me though, discussion assignments never do anything for me.
		I complete them just to complete them.
		Every student has a different learning style and has different things that work better or worse for getting down the material.
		For me though, the discussion assignments just seem like echo chambers, where everyone repeats the same information over and over.
		I don&apos;t find that useful.
		This is compounded by the fact that we&apos;re not allowed to read the other posts until we&apos;ve completed our own.
		On the rare occasion that I&apos;m struggling with something a discussion assignment covers, I can&apos;t get help from other students until I&apos;ve already figured out the material, written up my post, and no longer need any help.
		Discussion assignments do absolutely zero for me in terms of learning new material.
		It&apos;s the long written assignments, such as essays, that help me the most when learning.
	</p>
	<p>
		Three questions sort of follow the same line of thought, so I&apos;ll cover them all in one paragraph: what material made us want to learn more, what was challenging, and what do we realise about our learning styles.
		Due to behaviours and actions of staff at this school (not any professors, but people in other departments; mostly the censorship the school now imposes on me), I&apos;m afraid the joy of learning has been drained right out of me.
		I don&apos;t do well when censored.
		I wilt.
		I whither.
		I do my best to get down the material, but serious damage has been done, and it eliminates the sort of enthusiasm I would otherwise have - enthusiasm that I had in every course when I first got to this school.
		As for what was challenging, nothing really was this week, which surprised me.
		The material was mostly review, and the new terminology I learned didn&apos;t come with any new concepts; I could just attach the terms to concepts I was already familiar with but didn&apos;t previously know how to convey concisely.
		I&apos;ve learned nothing new about my learning style, but could see what I&apos;ve already known for a long time: I learn best when I write.
		While the written assignment for the week was incredibly short, it reinforced the material covered this week.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, we were asked what we feel about the feedback from our peers.
		When we get feedback, it&apos;s from the assignments we completed two weeks ago.
		Two weeks ago, we submit an assignment, one week ago, the grading is done, then this week, we see the feedback.
		The course started this week, so there was no feedback yet.
		This question is moot.

	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
	<p>
		The reading assignment for the week was Chapters 1.1 through 1.3 of <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/646638/mod_resource/content/2/dmoi-tablet.pdf">Discrete Mathematics - dmoi-tablet.pdf</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like last week, this week&apos;s learning journal assignment asks about the feedback we received this week.
		We won&apos;t receive our first feedback until next week though.
		Instead, I guess I&apos;ll discuss the submissions I graded this week.
		The third was mostly very good, though the Venn diagram was a bit incorrectly labelled.
		The other two mistook <var>U</var> - a specific, five-element set described by the assignment instructions - for being the universal set.
		I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_set">Wikipedia</a> explains pretty well why this is incorrect.
		The universal set is an infinite set that includes all possible elements.
		The universal set even includes itself, making it a recursive set.
		A simple set containing only five integers isn&apos;t the universal set.
		Perhaps it was misleading for the set described by the instructions to be named <var>U</var>, as this is the same name typically used to refer to the universal set.
		Another common problem seemed to be thinking that the inverse of <var>A</var> was a finite set and not an infinite set containing all but three possible elements.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wouldn&apos;t exactly say I learned something new this week, but I did relearn something I&apos;d forgotten.
		I&apos;d forgotten how to use one equation to prove another one true.
		It&apos;s really a simple matter of setting an expression equal to itself, making substitutions on one side, then simplifying the resulting equation.
		I&apos;d forgotten that first, critical step though.
		Normally, discussion assignments are of zero benefit to me because they&apos;re just an echo chamber of everyone repeating what they read, and the fact that this week&apos;s work was a discussion assignment wasn&apos;t beneficial over the alternative of that same assignment being issued as a written assignment instead, but the assignment itself was helpful in reminding me of that simple option when working with equations.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess the main challenge for the week was just figuring out how to use one equation to prove another.
		I&apos;m not sure I would have remembered how to do that on my own.
		I&apos;m glad I asked for help on that though.
		One of my fellow <abbr title="Linux User Group">LUG</abbr> members wrote up a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem, which pointed me in the right direction.
		I ended up not using their steps, so the work I submitted was my own, but it got me past that initial hurdle of not even knowing where to start.
		In actuality, they didn&apos;t read that carefully, and got the initial problem incorrect, making their steps incorrect as well, but that worked out just fine anyway because all I needed was a spark of remembering how to get started on such a problem.
		I was worried going into this course that it might be one of those maths courses that&apos;s a bit over my head, but things seem to be going well so far.
		I could probably due with a bit more difficulty, to be honest, though as I&apos;ve been overworked lately at my day job, I really won&apos;t complain about easy coursework.
		I do need to remember to reach out when I don&apos;t get something though.
		It&apos;s not something I typically do, and it was only odd circumstances that led me to get help this time.
