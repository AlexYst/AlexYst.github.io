		I was quite shocked to read that there will be group projects in this course.
		I&apos;m not looking forward to that.
		As of late, I&apos;ve barely had the time to get my assignments completed and submitted at all.
		Adding group work to the mix is going to make this immensely more difficult.
		How are we to coordinate with our group members in a timely fashion?
		The only way I can think to reach group members is via email, but many people don&apos;t check their email often enough to substitute for real-time conversation.
		Personally, I&apos;d be fine with using <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> for real-time communication, but I&apos;m not sure everyone in the course is even familiar with <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>.
		I imagine some students will want to use the web chat feature of certain social media sites, but most of the big ones won&apos;t even let me register an account, so that won&apos;t work.
		This doesn&apos;t bode well, and I&apos;m not looking forward to trying to make this work.
		It&apos;d be easier if we were an in-person class, y&apos;know?
		Then we could work on group projects face-to-face.

		Aside from the reading assignment and this learning journal assignment, the only work for the week was the discussion assignment.
		There, we brute force, branch-and-bounds algorithms, and asymptotic complexities.
		I think I might have read about branch-and-bounds algorithms in another course, but I&apos;m not sure.
		If I did, I don&apos;t really remember them well, so this was good review for me.
		Brut force is so simple that there&apos;s really no forgetting it.
		I usually try to do things without resorting to brute force, but it&apos;s a tool that I do use against problems when I can&apos;t think of a better way.
		Often, when I use brute force as a last resort, it takes so long to finish that in the hours it&apos;s running, I come up with something much faster, then interrupt the brute force script and write the better script to run instead.
		As for asymptotic complexities, I know I learned big oh, big theta, and big omega notation, but I don&apos;t recall small oh and small omega notation.
		Also, I feel like the textbook from this course explained all the notations better than the one in the other course, so I understand the differences better than before.
	</p>
	<p>
		I still don&apos;t really get why asymptotic complexities are done the way they are though.
		You throw out less-significant information such as constants.
		In other words, you throw out perfectly-good information that is known about run times.
		That gives you less accurate information with which to estimate how long it&apos;ll take for algorithms to run.
		This information is less impactful than the information you keep, but it&apos;s still useful in, for example, as a tie-breaker between algorithms with similar run times.
		2x + 4 and 2x + 504 both have an asymptotic complexity of Θ(x), for example, even though the second one has much more overhead, even if that overhead isn&apos;t changed based on input size.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reading assignment also covered several terms I&apos;m already well familiar with.
		Recursion was one of the main themes.
		Recursion is one of those things that&apos;s really powerful, but that I almost always think is the wrong tool for the job.
		At times, it makes the functionality of written code more obvious to the reader.
		Other times (often with huge overlap with the previous cases), it makes seemingly-unsolvable problems a piece of cake to deal with.
		But when used unnecessarily, it seems like a rather heavy hammer for a small nail.
		I&apos;ve gotten a pretty good feel for when using it&apos;s right though.
		If I can&apos;t come up with  non-recursive solution and it feels like I should be able to, I&apos;ve usually overlooked something big, and my code is needlessly complex.
		I suppose recursive programming functions are bit more touchy than recursive mathematical functions, and we&apos;re dealing with the latter so far in this course.
		Still, the idea of recursion is the same in both cases, and it&apos;s just as powerful in both.
