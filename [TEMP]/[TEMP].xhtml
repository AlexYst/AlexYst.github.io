<h2>What linear function has f(0) = 5 and f(7) = 12?</h2>
<p>
	To fine the linear function that passes through these points, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept.
	Because the y-intercept is simply the output of the function when the input is zero, the y-intercept was already given to us.
	It&apos;s five.
	To find the slope, we take the output gotten from any non-zero input, subtract the y-intercept, and divide by the non-zero input used to produce the output we used in our calculation.
	In our case, seven is the only other input we have, and its output is twelve.
	Twelve minus five is seven, and seven divided by seven is one, so the slope is one.
	Our final linear function comes out to be:
</p>
<p>
	f(<var>x</var>) = <var>x</var> + 5
</p>
<h2>If f(<var>t</var>) = 2<var>t</var> - <var>t</var><sup>2</sup>, what is (f(<var>t</var> + <var>h</var>) - f(<var>t</var>)) / <var>h</var>?</h2>
<p>
	To solve this, we just substitute &quot;(f(<var>t</var> + <var>h</var>)&quot; for the equation provided for f(<var>t</var>), but with all instances of <var>t</var> replaced with &quot;(<var>t</var> + <var>h</var>)&quot;, as well as substitute &quot;f(<var>t</var>)&quot; for the equation verbatim.
	With that, the equation is technically completely solved, though to make it make more sense, we should simplify it with a series of reductions.
</p>
<ol start="0">
	<li>
		(f(<var>t</var> + <var>h</var>) - f(<var>t</var>)) / <var>h</var> [original equation]
	</li>

		((2(<var>t</var> + <var>h</var>) - (<var>t</var> + <var>h</var>)<sup>2</sup>) - (2<var>t</var> - <var>t</var><sup>2</sup>)) / <var>h</var> [substitute as described above]

	</li>
	<li>
		(2<var>h</var> - <var>h</var><sup>2</sup> - 2<var>t</var><var>h</var>) / <var>h</var> [combine like terms]
	</li>
	<li>
		2 - <var>h</var> - 2<var>t</var> [factor <var>h</var> out of everything to cancel out the denominator]
	</li>
	<p>
		Our final reduced solution, &quot;2 - <var>h</var> - 2<var>t</var>&quot;, is much more manageable.

<h2>For what <var>x</var> does sin 2<var>x</var> = cos 2<var>x</var>?</h2>
<p>
	I don&apos;t think I solved this one in the most mathematically-efficient way, but I used mathematical concepts the entire way none the less, and my solution is mathematically checkable.
	Anyway, the first thing I did was assign a new variable.
	We&apos;re working with 2<var>x</var> in both cases, so we&apos;re going to need to divide our solution in half when we find it, but we&apos;re basically just looking for the place where the sine of a value is the same as the cosine of the same value.
	So I assigned <var>y</var> to be equal to 2<var>x</var>, and looked instead for the value of <var>y</var> in sin(<var>y</var>) = cos(<var>y</var>).
	As odd as it sounds, having the doubling in there had confused me enough that I&apos;d forgotten basic trigonometric concepts that I&apos;ve known for years.
	With it gone, I remembered that this equality occurs at a 45° angle on the unit circle, as well as at a 225° angle.
	Sine and cosine work with radians, and a circle measures 2π radians around, measured from the central point.
	To reach a forty-five degree angle, I&apos;d need to travel one eighth of the way, which would be 0.25π radians.
	Using this guess, I used a calculator to find sin(0.25π) and cos(0.25π), and found them to be equal.
	This means <var>y</var> can be 0.25π, meaning that <var>x</var> can be half of that, making it 0.125π.
	Using a calculator, we can&apos;t get an exact value for sin(2<var>x</var>) and cos(2<var>x</var>), but if you know the trigonometric unit circle, you know this value to be (√(2)/2).
</p>
<p>
	As a side note, sine and cosine are cyclical in their outputs.
	Another working value I found for <var>x</var> was -0.375π.
	An infinite number of other values will work for this equation as well.
