	<p>
		Sure, science is technically only one way to explain nature.
		But it&apos;s the most reasonable and methodical way.
		By using scientific processes, we pose questions, then gather evidence to try to disprove one option or the other.
		And that&apos;s the thing, too: scientific reasoning doesn&apos;t prove anything.
		At least not directly.
		What scientific reasoning does is <strong>*disprove*</strong> things.
		It&apos;s a form of deductive reasoning, not inductive.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are other ways to explain the world and human behaviours though.
		For example, we have superstitions and religions, many of which come from the ancient world.
		These things predate science, and used to serve a similar role: to make sense of an otherwise chaotic existence.
		They&apos;re not exactly <strong>*valid*</strong> ways of explaining the world, but it&apos;s amazing how many people still cling to them in the modern day.
		Mental illness, for example, can be explained by demonic possession or mischievous spirits playing tricks on the victim.
		These ideas are, of course, completely unfounded.
		But while we can&apos;t exactly prove them, I guess we can&apos;t really disprove some of them either, which is why such questions aren&apos;t even addressed by science.
		Science relies on empirical evidence to disprove wrong ideas and leave behind right ideas.
		The supernatural, on the other hand, seeks to assert unprovable answers instead of gathering evidence or even taking a moment to really think about what questions are the right ones to ask.
		And often times, as science progresses, these unprovable answers start to fall into territory where they <strong>*can*</strong> be disproven.
		The seasons can be explained as the deity in charge of summer becoming neglectful during the half of the year their child has to live in the underworld, but the tilt of the planet&apos;s axis and the fact that opposing seasons play out at once on opposite sides of the globe tell us the neglect theory doesn&apos;t make sense.
		Thunder can be explained as the sounds of a giant chariot being pulled along the ground in the clouds, but we&apos;ve been to the clouds now.
		There is no ground there and there are no chariots to be pulled across said ground.
		The things are just water vapour, made visible by the fact that water refracts light differently than the air around it does.
		Surviving religions tend to try to conform to science, because even religious people are usually not crazy enough to try to claim scientific facts are wrong.
		For example, the Christian bible tells us that the earth is a flat disk in a dome, surrounded by water all around.
		Not just on the edges, but above, too.
		Rain is produced by opening little windows in the ceiling of this dome.
		Heaven is up above this dome, I guess in the water or something.
		However, modern Christians don&apos;t actually take this as fact any more - often even unaware that their holy book says this - and instead claim heaven to be an extra-dimensional plane separate from our own.
		Science has already disproved that our planet is flat and that we&apos;re inside a dome, so Christians have accepted the scientific explanation for rain and pushed their god&apos;s world outside the realm of where we can yet disprove.
		That&apos;s the sort of place supposed gods typically reside, too: just out of our perception.
		The Greeks housed theirs on Mount Olympus, a mountain far too difficult to climb at the time.
		And now that we&apos;ve actually been there, there&apos;s no signs of any gods having ever been there themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
		So sure, we can make the claim that science is only one way to see the world.
		That is, technically speaking, a true statement.
		But when we try to use an alternative lens to understand ourselves and the world around us, we end up with wildly differing explanations, none of which are plausible and many of which are outright impossible.
		Science is always in flux.
		We all know the big bang theory, for example.
		I&apos;m not sure if anything ever came of it, but for a while, I heard scientists were considering that perhaps this theory was wrong.
		Instead, the universe might not have had a start, but instead, just always was.
		And perhaps the reason the universe looks to us to be expanding - which we hypothesise due to the spectral distortion of light from distant planetary bodies causing longer wavelengths than would otherwise be expected - is just due to an odd spacial distortion that surrounds our pocket of the universe.
		Some of what we &quot;know&quot; because of science is just plain wrong.
		That&apos;s why we have to go back and challenge our basic understanding sometimes.
		However, at least through science, questioning is not only accepted, but outright encouraged.
		Other forms of explanations, such as religion, often instead just encourage blind acceptance, and even justification in the face of disapproval or argument (a tactic known as &quot;apologetics&quot;).
		While science doesn&apos;t always have all the answers, it does shift us eve-closer to the truth.
		To date, it&apos;s the best explanation we have for how we work and how our world works.

	<h3>The nervous system</h3>
	<p>
		The nervous system is divided up into the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
	</p>
	<h4>The central nervous system</h4>
	<p>
		The central nervous system is essentially the core in terms of functionality.
		It&apos;s central command for the body, and both issues the orders and processes information in order to decide what orders to give.
		It&apos;s composed of the brain in the head, which we usually think of as the main organ that controls us, as well as the spinal cord running through our vertebrae down our backs.
		Notably, the spinal cord does not reach all the way down the spine though.
		It only extends to just below the ribs (OpenStax College, 2017).
	</p>
	<h5>The brain</h5>
	<p>
		The surface of the brain, covered in groves called gyri and lumps called sulci, is called the cerebral cortex (OpenStax College, 2017).
		The longitudinal fissure is a gyri that separates teh left and right hemisphere of the brain (OpenStax College, 2017).
		The textbook points out that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right half of the body and the right hemisphere controls the left half of the body.
		The two are connected by the corpus callosum, a band of nerves (OpenStax College, 2017).
	</p>
	<p>
		Experiments have shown that when the corpus callosum is severed, the two hemispheres start operating independently of one another, as they&apos;re unable to communicate.
		This has interesting and unnerving effects for the subject.
		For example, things seen by the left eye but not the right eye can&apos;t be named, because the right hemisphere doesn&apos;t control speech (OpenStax College, 2017).
		One thing the textbook didn&apos;t mention is that one hemisphere can take over the other hemisphere&apos;s duties if need be.
		In patients in which one hemisphere has had to be removed for some reason, the person doesn&apos;t become unable to move half their body.
		Instead, the remaining hemisphere assumes command of the whole body.
		I guess it&apos;s a redundant system, with us basically having two brains, perhaps in case one hemisphere fails?
		That said, some mental activities are significantly harder to perform or even impossible if half of your brain is missing.
		You can survive and function in society, but you&apos;re not going to be the most intelligent or creative person around.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cerebral cortex is divided up into lobes.
		The frontal lobe is located at the front part of the brain and controls logic thinking, emotion, language, and motor control.
		The parietal lobe is located on top and interprets/processes sensory input aside from hearing and vision.
		The temporal lobe at the side of the head handles hearing and memory.
		It also handles emotion like the frontal lobe, and some aspects of language.
		The occipital lobe at the back of the brain handles vision (OpenStax College, 2017).
		Under the cerebral cortex is the forebrain, which is divided up into the thalamus and the limbic system.
		The thalamus routes non-olfactory sensory information to the appropriate part of the brain for processing.
		The limbic system processes memories, olfactory information, and emotions.
		It is further subdivided into the hippocampus, used for learning and memory; the amygdala, used to relate emotions to memories; and the hypothalamus, used for temperature regulation, sexual instinct, blood pressure, and apatite (OpenStax College, 2017).
		Which of the three processes scents?
		From context, I&apos;d guess it&apos;s likely the amygdala or maybe the hippocampus, but the textbook doesn&apos;t say.
	</p>
	<p>
		The midbrain is the deepest part of the brain from the surface, and contains most of the reticular formation.
		The reticular formation regulates sleep, wakefulness, alertness, and things of that nature.
		The midbrain also contains the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area, both of which are used for dopamine production, are critical for regulating movement, and are responsible for moods and the reward system.
		Of note, this reward system is a big part of how addiction works, so these structures are responsible for addiction as well.
		The hindbrain is the lump at the back of the brain, and is divided into the medulla, the pons, and the cerebellum.
		The medulla regulates automatic systems such as the heart and lungs.
		The pons acts as a connection between the rest of the brain and the spinal cord.
		The cerebellum deals with messages from various parts of the body such as the inner ear (used for balance), the tendons, and the muscles.
		It also is the part of the brain that learns and stores procedural memory (which is basically memory of how to perform tasks or procedures) (OpenStax College, 2017).
	</p>
	<h5>The spinal cord</h5>
	<p>
		Interestingly, the spinal cord is what&apos;s responsible for reflexes, not the brain.
		While the spinal cord acts as a routing station for messages to and from the brain, it will intercept and act on certain signals (OpenStax College, 2017).
		This is purely speculation on my part, but I think this could be why we can&apos;t control our reflexes.
		Basically, our personalities and thoughts are just manifestations of some of the processes in the brain.
		So if the brain is entirely left out of the process of something, we don&apos;t have conscious control over it.
	</p>
	<h4>The peripheral nervous system</h4>
	<p>
		The peripheral nervous system is further subdivided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.
		The somatic nervous system is divided into motor neurons and sensory neurons.
		Sensory neurons, as the name implies, carry sensory signals back to the spinal cord to either be intercepted and acted upon by the spinal cord in the form of reflexes of be passed on to the brain.
		Motor neurons, again as the name would imply, are used to pass signals from the spinal cord to the parts of our body we consciously control.
		The autonomic nervous system carries signals to and from the parts of our body that seem to do their own thing without our conscious input.
		It&apos;s divided into the sympathetic nervous system, which deals with stress preparedness, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which inverses the function of the sympathetic nervous system, thereby returning the body to its default state (OpenStax College, 2017).
	</p>
	<h3>Why study sleep in this psychology course? What benefit does sleep provide the brain and body?</h3>
	<p>
		Psychology is the study of the mind and the way in which it operates.
		Things that naturally impact that operation seem highly relevant to the topic of the course.
		It wouldn&apos;t surprise me if we studied how we impact each other&apos;s mental health or behaviours either, or even how behavioural addictions and habits work.
		Likewise, if this weren&apos;t an introduction course, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we covered things such as how substances (read: drugs) affect our mental state and operation.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for what sleep actually does for us, we&apos;re not sure (OpenStax College, 2017).
		So what in our evolution would cause us to just go dormant every day for hours on end?
		Some hypothesise that it&apos;s to conserve energy, though nothing seems to back up this hypothesis and some evidence even seems to outright refute it (OpenStax College, 2017).
		It might also be because darkness is dangerous (OpenStax College, 2017).
		We ... have the eyes of an herbivore.
		That is to say our eyes are built to see colour, which is useful for distinguishing fruits from one another.
		However, so much of the space in our eyes is dedicated to colour vision that we don&apos;t have enough space for the structures needed to distinguish amounts of light.
		We have some, and probably need them to get a clear picture at all, but the amount of light we need to intake to hit those parts of our eye with enough to be usable is rather high because of how few of those structures we have.
		This results in a marked difficulty in seeing in the dark.
		Carnivores make the opposite trade-off: they can usually see in the dark very well, but don&apos;t tend to much if any colour vision.
		Anyway, night blindness leaves us vulnerable to predators.
		Or it did in the past, anyway.
		Like many of our brain&apos;s functions - such as the fact that it treats all threats with a fight or flight response, regardless of the fact that most stressful situations in the modern day aren&apos;t actually dangerous - sleep might just be a functionality that we&apos;re developed beyond the need for.
		Our need for sleep might now be more of a hindrance than an actual help.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s worth noting that sleep has been linked to memory retention (OpenStax College, 2017).
		Is this because sleep is actually vital for some part of the memory-building process?
		Maybe.
		Or perhaps it&apos;s just another quirk left behind by our evolution.
	</p>
	<h3>Sleep deprivation</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been experiencing frequent sleep deprivation for quite a while now.
		It&apos;s rather unavoidable.
		It&apos;s funny that this assignment should ask about the effects of it on my physical, mental and emotional health; given the cause.
		The school has been censoring me and my website since 2017-11-01.
		Worse, rather than politely ask me to take down what I&apos;d written, the school jumped straight to threatening me from the start.
		They threatened that if i didn&apos;t comply, they&apos;d retroactively fail me from my courses and/or expel me from the school.
		The initial effect of this was that the mental and emotional stress caused me to fall ill, and I stayed in bed for a few days with killer headaches.
		Since then, the headaches are gone, but they&apos;ve been replaced by a severe apathy and lethargy that most strongly manifests when I&apos;m trying to do anything school-related.
		This isn&apos;t the only garbage the school pulls on me, though it is what has me broken for the time being.
		With me in such a state though, many other things that would normally not even phase me chip away at my mental state further.
		This harm to my mental and emotional heath has been growing, and at least as far back as January of this year, I&apos;ve noticed enough of a buildup to amount to a significant decline in my mental state.
		Slowly, this censorship has been taking its toll on me, and now the effects are quite easily apparent.
		One effect of this increasing lethargy is that I sometimes stare at my computer for hours on end just trying to get myself to actually read the material or work on the coursework.
		That lost time, which would otherwise be spent actually <strong>*doing*</strong> the coursework, adds up.
		I end up not having time to get everything done when I should be awake, and en up pulling all-nighters to get my coursework completed and handed in on time.
		In other words, it&apos;s harm to my mental and emotional health that leads to my sleep deprivation.
		However, it works the other way around, too.
		That sleep deprivation leads to further degradation of mental, physical, and emotional health; which in turn leads to further sleep deprivation.
		It&apos;s a downward spiral, and I only have two options: I can break the cycle by dropping out of school to eliminate the root source of the problem or I can keep myself together as best I can and just push through.
		I choose to push through and finish off my degree.
		This will end.
		Barring any further setbacks, which the school has hit me with several of already, the final exam for my final course will occur on Thursday, 2021-06-03.
		After that, I&apos;ll be free of this place and will be able to begin my recovery.
	</p>
	<p>
		Aside from the downward spiral in my mental and emotional health, some less-ongoing symptoms manifest specifically on days after I haven&apos;t had as much rest as I would like to have had.
		I was describing the main feeling I get as a sort of buzz to one of my workmates.
		That particular workmate likes to use marijuana and alcohol, and mentioned that what they describe as a buzz probably isn&apos;t what I mean by the term.
		We got to talking though, and it sounds like the feeling actually is rather similar to what they feel when high.
		It&apos;s sort of a pressure in the head or presence that doesn&apos;t doesn&apos;t go away.
		It&apos;s like a migraine, but without any actual pain.
		It seems like we were describing the same thing, except that except that their buzz is pleasant and mine is not.
		It&apos;s interesting that we have similar meaning for buzz, seeing as they don&apos;t get that feeling when sleep deprived and I&apos;ve never used recreational drugs so I don&apos;t know what they feel like.
		I guess when I get desperate, I use caffeine, which gives me an even worse buzz especially when I&apos;m already tired.
		Caffeine&apos;s a drug too, so if the buzz given by different drugs is the same, then I guess I do know what a drug buzz feels like, I just don&apos;t enjoy the feeling.
		It clouds my thoughts.
		During a day after a sleep-deprived night in which I did get some sleep, just not enough, this clouding of my thoughts leaves me still rather functional, but a bit slower, and operating with a reduced vocabulary.
		I know what I want to convey and know I know the words that would convey it are somewhere in my brain, but often find I&apos;m not able to actually locate said words to use them.
		I&apos;m not perpetually in this state though.
		One good night&apos;s sleep reverses the effect.

	<h3>Connections between memory and intelligence</h3>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t see any direct connections between memory and intelligence mentioned in the textbook this week, but it&apos;s very possible that I could have missed it.
		However, there are a few connections we can make on our own.
		Personally, I define intelligence as the capacity to learn and effectively use information.
		We can&apos;t use what we can&apos;t remember.
		For that reason, we need memory to make use of intelligence.
		The textbook compares our memory to that of a computer (OpenStax College, 2017).
		By that analogy, we have two main kinds of memory: working memory (similar to <abbr title="random-access memory">RAM</abbr>) and long-term memory (similar to disk space).
		What we learn goes into long-term memory until we forget it, so the more long-term memory we have, the more we can learn and the more we can know at once.
		Long-term memory isn&apos;t useful unless we load it into working memory though.
		The more working memory we possess, the more information we can process at once, so the more we can account for in our plans, estimates, and understanding of the situation at hand.
		Another important part of memory use is using it effectively, which either involves learning better ways to remember (and that learning requires intelligence and memory) or having the right instincts to naturally use memory effectively.
		The textbook also mentions a technique it refers to as &quot;chunking&quot;.
		I haven&apos;t used this for long-term memory before, but I use it on a regular basis for problem-solving, especially for solving mathematical problems.
		For example, I work a cash register, but often have to give customers their prices while I&apos;m away from the register if I want to effectively use my time.
		I use chunking to rearrange the items they&apos;ve requested into a position that makes the equation easier to work with.
		I&apos;ve often thought of the process in terms of a physical model  using blocks of different sizes, and due to our base-ten number system, I often try to arrange the items so they add up into multiples of ten.
		For example, a customer might buy things with these prices: two for Â¤3 each, one for Â¤9, one for Â¤7, and one for Â¤1.
		The equation, using parentheses to denote order, would be (((2 * 3) + 9) + 7) + 1.
		That&apos;s a pain to work with though.
		So I rearrange as this: ((3 + 7) + (9 + 1)) + 3.
		Doing that, I can easily see the total as Â¤23.
		I simply don&apos;t have enough working memory to both remember the order items and compute the total price the normal way, so I compress the equation in such a way that I can solve it with less memory.
	</p>
	<h3>Techniques for enhancing memory</h3>
	<p>
		The three main things I do to enhance my use of memory are to use external memory for things I don&apos;t need right away but will need later, throw out useless data that isn&apos;t worth storing, and compress data that I need to memorise in such a way that using the data doesn&apos;t require decompression.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main thing I do for enhancing memory is to find ways of not storing data in my brain.
		I have terrible memory, and with my stress levels having been building over the past three years especially, my limits of both my active and long-term memory have been suffering substantially.
		With the upper limits to what my internal memory can deal with getting smaller, I frequently make use of external memory instead.
		I usually have a pen and paper somewhere nearby.
		Who even cares if I can remember all seven things I need to do when I get home today, if I can instead remember just the one task of looking at the list I wrote while those seven other tasks were fresh on my mind?
		Writing like that often increases the odds I&apos;ll remember without looking at the notes I&apos;ve written too.
		So if I don&apos;t write the note, I end up needing the note that I don&apos;t have, but if I write the note, sometimes I won&apos;t even need it simply because I internalised the data by writing it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing I tend to do is keep track of only what I need to.
		If I don&apos;t need certain data, I&apos;ll ignore it so I can remember what I actually need to know.
		Often times, people are surprised by how quickly I&apos;ll forget something.
		A customer will walk out the door, for example, then I&apos;ll tell a workmate about some interesting aspect of my exchange with them.
		My workmate will ask about their gender, or hair colour, or apparel, or something like that, and I simply won&apos;t be able recall.
		I&apos;ve already thrown out that data because it wasn&apos;t useful and wasn&apos;t of interest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing I do to remember more things is to change the way I think about them so they fit into a smaller section of memory (OpenStax College, 2017).
		An example of this is that, while I do set the alarm every night when I close the store at the end of my shift, I wouldn&apos;t be able to tell you the alarm code right away if you ask.
		I don&apos;t remember the digits.
		Instead, I remember the pattern of where the buttons exist spatially in sequence as I move my hand around the number pad.
		I can, of course, translate that back into a numeric sequence when I need to, but I have to visualise the number pad and trace the pattern in my mind to do so.
		I use various forms of such memory compression throughout the day to get by with what little memory I have with little difference noticed unless I need to pass the information on.
		I can&apos;t express the compressed data as clearly as the uncompresssed data, so I have to decompress it first, but when using the data myself, I&apos;ve compressed it in such a way that using the compressed version is as quick as using the uncompressed version, if not faster.

	<p>
		There were some similar opinions on sexual orientation in the discussion forum this week, but also some radically different ones.
		Of the posts I read, I noticed that most people were accepting of different sexual orientations and felt society should follow suit.
		One student though disagreed.
		That said, the points they made were completely invalid.
		They made the claim that children do better when raised by two parents instead of just one, which is valid, but then tried to use that as evidence that same-sex couples aren&apos;t acceptable.
		First of all, not all couples have children, but more importantly, a child raised by a same-sex couple is still being raised by two loving parents.
		You can&apos;t compare single parents to coupled parents and claim it has anything to do with the difference between same-sex parents and opposite-sex parents.
		Second, they tried to claim that breeding is a reason why same-sex pairing isn&apos;t okay.
		They made the claim that we could die out without opposite-sex couples.
		The planet is overpopulated with humans though.
		We don&apos;t need more breeding, we need <strong>*less*</strong> breeding!
		It&apos;s perfectly fine for even more than half of couples to simply not breed - be they same-sex couples or opposite-sex couples - and we&apos;re still going to be nowhere near dying out.
		But also, it&apos;s always going to be the case that opposite-sex couples outnumber same-sex couples.
		For now, most people breed, and that may or may not change, but with how low of a percentage of couples are same-sex couples, same-sex couples aren&apos;t a threat to the continuation of the human species.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an aside, I&apos;m actually a part of the <a href="http://vhemt.org/">Voluntary Human Extinction Movement</a>, so I <strong>*want*</strong> us to die out.
		Being bisexual, I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ll end up in a same-sex pairing or opposite-sex pairing in the long run, but either way, I&apos;ve had myself surgically sterilised just in case.
		For that reason, arguments that we need to try to avoid dying out hold no weight with me.
		That aside though, the argument that same-sex couples could be the cause of us dying out is completely ludicrous.
		If we do die out, it&apos;s not going to be because of same-sex couples.
		It&apos;s going to be either because the majority of opposite-sex couples decide to do the right thing and not breed or because we do something stupid and get ourselves killed, such as blowing up the planet with nuclear weapons, poisoning the global water supply, or allowing climate change to progress to the point that we can&apos;t sustain ourselves any more.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for ageing, the responses were much more diverse, but also something I was admittedly less invested in emotionally.
		Some people reported the elderly as being better respected in their cultures, while others reported people looking upon the ageing process unfavourably.
	</p>
	<p>
		I found the comment in the learning journal about reporting any feelings of needing support caused by the discussion assignment to the professor somewhat interesting.
		Was the discussion assignment this week really supposed to be that unnerving or traumatic?
		Perhaps I didn&apos;t feel the effects because I&apos;m too numb from my depression caused by unrelated matters.
		Still, it seemed like the sort of discussion that might cause a bit of anger, but not something I&apos;d describe as disturbing.
		If I weren&apos;t so numb, I&apos;d probably be furious with that one judgemental idiot I mentioned in my first paragraph.
		I guess maybe if you&apos;re less comfortable with who you are though and/or if there was a bit less acceptance in the discussion board - this assignment was written up before anyone had seen how the discussion would play out - discussion could have been a bit disturbing for some.

	<h2>Unit 6</h2>
	<h3>How society has shaped my views</h3>
	<p>
		It&apos;s hard to say how society has shaped my views.
		To know the full extent, we&apos;d need not only the test case (having been exposed to society) but also the control case (having not been exposed to society).
		However, there are several ways in which my views couldn&apos;t be what they are today without society.
	</p>
	<p>
		For starters, society exposed me to science and religion.
		For a time, my views were shaped by the religion of my parents, until a point in which I realised those views don&apos;t make sense.
		I&apos;ve done much research since then, and have come to the view that religion is a plague upon the minds of humanity.
		While this isn&apos;t a popular opinion, it&apos;s one I wouldn&apos;t hold without exposure to society.
		As for science, I base most of my understanding on my understanding and misunderstanding of science.
		I&apos;m wrong at times, but I can&apos;t get everything right.
		It&apos;s just not humanly possible.
		And science is another thing I wouldn&apos;t have without society.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve also derived many of my values and my sense of morality from society.
		Many of my values are contrary to society&apos;s values, though very much shaped by my interactions with society.
		For example, I believe copyright is censorship and that patents hold back innovation, not promote it.
		This makes both copyright and patents evil, in my beliefs.
		Because of science, I believe that people create people; deities don&apos;t create people.
		And everyone that gets created dies.
		That makes parents responsible for all death.
		To cause the death of another human seems so morally repugnant, which makes creating new life just as repugnant, as creating life and causing death are necessarily one and the same.
		After all, even if someone were to kill me, they didn&apos;t cause my death; they only moved up the date.
		To create a human being is the absolute worst action I could possibly perform (or, <strong>*could*</strong> have performed before having gotten myself surgically sterilised, anyway).
		That view is very much derived from a number of societal influence, even though it&apos;s contrary to what most of society believes.
	</p>
	<h3>Pressure toward conformity</h3>
	<p>
		There are all sorts of things I&apos;ve been pressured to conform to.
		Where there&apos;s not a direct threat to my life though, I tend not to conform if it&apos;s something I actually care about.
		And when I don&apos;t care, I don&apos;t really feel the pressure.
		It&apos;s like wind on a plant.
		Is a blade of grass really impacted by the wind?
		Not really, as it just goes along with it and doesn&apos;t even notice.
		On the other hand, a mighty tree may lose a few branches or even get tipped over if fighting a particularly strong wind.
		As I don&apos;t tend to notice pressures on things I don&apos;t care about, I can&apos;t really discus the things I conform to very well, as I don&apos;t know which things are mere suggestions and which are actual pressures.
		They result in the same for me.
		When it comes to things I care about though, I don&apos;t bend.
		My life motto is &quot;compromise is always wrong when it means sacrificing a principle&quot;.
		Admittedly, I got the eloquent wording from a fortune cookie, but I&apos;d been living by the concept without a good way to describe it for decades before I even encountered that cookie.
	</p>
	<h4>Breeding</h4>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been pressured to breed in quite a bit.
		Society expects it, there are tax breaks, et cetera.
		My grandmother really wanted me to give her biological great grandchildren before she died, even.
		My mother takes it as an insult that three of her four children choose not to breed.
		I&apos;ve always been very open about my intent not to breed though, and whenever someone brings it up, I immediately make it clear that no force on earth is going to get me to bend on the issue.
		If they keep pushing - and often even if they don&apos;t - I explain that breeding is the most evil thing I could do, and I wouldn&apos;t be able to live with myself if I engaged in such a heinous act.
		I explain that it&apos;s only breeding that begets death, and I refuse to be responsible for not only the deaths of my children, but the deaths of my grandchildren, my great grandchildren, et cetera along down the line.
		I explain that the most loving thing I can do for my descendants is to spare them from life and death and just not create them in the first place.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, I started having ... emotional garbage getting in my way.
		Some part of me <strong>*wanted*</strong> to breed.
		I feared myself and what I might do in the future.
		So while I was still of sound mind, I did the responsible thing: I got myself surgically sterilised.
		I&apos;d been declawed; that evil side of me no longer had a chance to do anything, even if it did take hold.
		I haven&apos;t heard from my darker side since.
		I assume it gave up, withered, and died.
		I&apos;ve felt so much more peaceful since then, knowing I&apos;m no longer capable of such an abhorrent act.
	</p>
	<h4>Proprietary software</h4>
	<p>
		I&apos;m frequently told I should install various forms of proprietary software.
		I&apos;m often told things such as that I&apos;m &quot;missing out&quot; or the like.
		What I&apos;m actually missing out on though is the guilt of running such software.
		I would feel like a sell-out, using these programs instead of freely-licensed replacements.
		Most of the time, all it takes is explaining that; I&apos;d rather give my time, money, and support to freely-licensed software.
		It was a major point of contention with my mother though when she was still speaking to me.
		I never understood why.
		For example, she got pissed off once that I wouldn&apos;t install some game she enjoyed on my computer (which wasn&apos;t actually compatible with the game, though she didn&apos;t know that at the time).
		She didn&apos;t even intend to use my computer, as she had her own, nor was it a multiplayer game she planned to play with me.
	</p>
	<h4>Telephone service</h4>
	<p>
		Many companies try to pressure me into getting telephone service and handing over my telephone number.
		I don&apos;t fall for that though.
		For example, Google and certain other companies won&apos;t even allow me to register an account because they demand that I provide a telephone number and let them ping me via <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> to ensure I gave them my real number.
		I don&apos;t have a telephone number though, and rather than get one, I simply don&apos;t use such services.
		Even if I had telephone service though, it these companies wouldn&apos;t have any right to the number and wouldn&apos;t have any right to harass me via telephone against my consent, so I&apos;d rather just not register an account.
		There was even one brick-and-mortar store I tried to register to get an ad booklet from via post that wouldn&apos;t let me without a telephone number.
		The company <strong>*refused to even serve me their ads*</strong> if I didn&apos;t provide them with a telephone number.
		How ridiculous is that?
		So I started to leave the store, and the representative decided to just put in a bogus telephone number on my account, so I ended up getting the ad booklets after all.
	</p>
	<p>
		One time, I dropped my wallet, too, and a thief found it up and ran up a bunch of bogus charges.
		My credit card company has a no-fraud-liability policy, so tried to get them to honour that.
		I&apos;ve read their policy, and it doesn&apos;t say the no-fraud-liability policy only applies to customers with telephones.
		I got in contact with them and tried to get the issue resolved, and they kept telling me I had to telephone in.
		I kept explaining that I have no telephone service and asking if that meant I was simply out the money, but they kept replying that I wasn&apos;t out the money and all I had to do was telephone them about it.
		I would have accepted being told I was out the money, and would have just footed the bill then cancelled the card and gone with a better company, but I think they didn&apos;t want to actually be honest and say that for legal reasons.
		I was not going to be told I wasn&apos;t out the money out one side of their mouths while being told out the other side that I had no access to their only way for me not to be out the money though.
		I argued with them for a couple months, just to get a straight answer.
		Finally, they agreed to help me without a telephone call.
		After all, they were capable of doing so the entire time and just didn&apos;t want to.
		You could say I wasted that time, but I disagree.
		On principle, they should either honour their policy or admit they&apos;re not going to.
		I wasn&apos;t going to have any part of that.
	</p>
	<h4>Using <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr></h4>
	<p>
		I used to have a mobile, though I used it for its computer features and Internet features, not its telephone features.
		I&apos;ve never liked the idea of <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>, as email was always a better option.
		If I was at my main computer, I could use a full keyboard to respond, but if I was on the go, I could use the touchscreen of the mobile.
		And using <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> gateways, I could send emails to people&apos;s <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> inboxes and they could send <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages to my email inbox.
		It worked out for everyone.
		With <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> though, I&apos;d have to use the tiny touchscreen no matter where I was, which would be aggravating.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before I got the device, my mother and I communicated through the gateways all the time.
		She preferred <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> but I had no mobile.
		Once I got one, I assumed nothing would change except that she could reach me on the go.
		She assumed that she&apos;d now be sending <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages to my telephone number.
		The next time that I sent her an email to her <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> box, she accused me of trying to hide my telephone number from her.
		She knew I&apos;ve always been opposed to using <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>, but she&apos;s always been highly accusatory like that.
		So I emailed her the number and also explained that she could use it to call me if she needed to, but that my device uses email instead of <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>.
		That was a stretch, but I figured it&apos;d cause less arguing than if I said the device could do <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> but I wasn&apos;t interested in using <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> for anything myself.
		It also wasn&apos;t technically a lie, as I&apos;d disabled the <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> application, so given the device&apos;s configuration, it indeed wasn&apos;t capable of <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Days later, she was upset I wasn&apos;t responding to messages, so I showed her I wasn&apos;t getting them.
		My first thought was to try to debug, and during the process, I ended up sending her a message to make sure it was coming through in the right thread on her end, as my messages to her were all getting through.
		She replied that it did come through, but it came from my email address, not my telephone number.
		And therein lied the problem: she was trying to send <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages to me despite my having explained when I gave her the number that she couldn&apos;t send me messages that way.
		The solution to that pressure was to have the foresight to disable the unwanted functionality from the beginning.
		I didn&apos;t even notice the pressure until I&apos;d won against it.
		We sat down and had another talk, and she didn&apos;t try <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr>ing me again.
		It&apos;s ironic, too.
		When she first got her mobile, she didn&apos;t use <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> either.
		She kept telling her friends not to <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> message her because she had to pay per message she received with no way to opt out of receiving them.
		But then, she gave in, and later, tried to cram <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messaging down my throat as it&apos;d been crammed down hers.
	</p>
	<h4>Gender conformity</h4>
	<p>
		I&apos;m an enby.
		I&apos;m frequently pressured to conform and claim to be cisgendered instead.
		The little things such as people using the wrong pronouns hurts me, but I&apos;m not assertive enough to stand up for myself, and mostly ignore it.
		It&apos;s something I need to work on.
		More major direct confrontations though, I tend to fight back.
		I make it very clear I&apos;m an enby, and I even sometimes pull out my state-issued <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> that identifies me not as a man or woman, but as an enby.
		When the government is even recognising me as what I am, most people give up arguing, aside form on the pronoun front.
		The exception would be my mother.
		She hasn&apos;t spoken with me for years because she can&apos;t except me for not being cisgendered.
	</p>
	<h4>Diet</h4>
	<p>
		I&apos;m an herbivore, by choice.
		There&apos;s constant pressure from all around to give in and eat animal products, given that they&apos;re in almost all food items.
		The worst part is that it&apos;s not directed at me, nor is it coming from a specific source.
		There&apos;s nothing to fight back against, yet I have to fight back anyway.
		It takes a lot of willpower at times, but I manage to eat nothing but plants, fungi, rocks, and synthetic chemicals.
		Never any animals.
	</p>
	<h4>Religion</h4>
	<p>
		Religion is all around, to the point that it&apos;s in common language in strange places where it doesn&apos;t actually need to be.
		It&apos;s even on the monetary system of my country; all the money says &quot;in god we trust&quot;, but I trust no such fictional entity.
		I try to make people aware of it when speaking to me, at least when relevant.
		For example, I started by telling people that I&apos;m unblessable when they&apos;d say &quot;bless you&quot; to me when I sneezed.
		I don&apos;t need religion shoved in my face just because I had a specific bodily reflex triggered.
		I also sometimes bring up that the reason why I&apos;m unblessable is because we atheists don&apos;t have souls to bless.
		Eventually, people stopped telling me &quot;bless you&quot; but continued saying it to one another when they sneeze around me.
		Honestly, that&apos;s all I&apos;m asking for.
		I don&apos;t care about hearing it, but I want to be left out of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lately, I&apos;ve also taken to asking people &quot;Which god?&quot; when they say things such as &quot;thank god&quot; to me.
		Sometimes, they say funny things such as &quot;Zeus&quot; or &quot;the spaghetti monster&quot;.
		I&apos;ve also started trying to incorporate phrases such as &quot;oh my Squid&quot; and &quot;thank Squiddy&quot; into my own vocabulary, in reference to <a href="https://marcwithac.bandcamp.com/track/love-my-little-squiddy">the Great Squiddy, who created and saved us all by fighting a giant shark called the megalodon</a>.
		That one&apos;s a bit harder though, as I&apos;m having to insert it in places I&apos;d typically say nothing.
		That is, I&apos;m having to add it to my vocabulary, not have it replace something else, as I&apos;m not used to using religion-centric phrases.
	</p>
	<h4>Celebration of holidays</h4>
	<p>
		Society pressures me to some days - labelled as &quot;holidays&quot; as magically being different in some way to the days that precede and follow them.
		Mostly, this is in the form of ignorable holiday merchandise.
		People that know me don&apos;t try to force holidays on me though.
		The main thing that actually affects me is strangers telling me &quot;happy X&quot; when X is coming up.
		I tend to reply something along the lines that I didn&apos;t realise that holiday was upon us, as I don&apos;t observe holidays.
		When it&apos;s a religious holiday, I tend to instead reply that I don&apos;t belong to X religion; due to the high population of Christians in my area, it&apos;s usually Christianity I&apos;m explaining I&apos;m not a part of.
	</p>
	<h4>Observance of my own birthday</h4>
	<p>
		Like holidays, birthdays are arbitrary days.
		I&apos;ll observe and even celebrate someone else&apos;s birthday if they&apos;d like me to, but I refuse to even acknowledge my own birthday.
		It drives me up the wall when people so much as tell me &quot;happy birthday&quot;, and when I explain that to people, they don&apos;t take me seriously and are then surprised when they tell me &quot;happy birthday&quot; just like I begged them not to when I told them when my birthday was (because they asked for it, or something).
		I gave up, and now refuse to tell anyone when my birthday is.
		I&apos;ll always tell them either that it lands on Fathers Day on some years (which is true and gets you close to knowing when it is without letting you have a specific date) or I tell them it&apos;s on March 7, which is actually the date I registered my domain on.
		If it&apos;s a company asking for a date of birth, I tell them I was born on 1970-01-01, the Unix Epoch, so any birthday-related garbage the want to send me is on too inaccurate of a date for me to even be bothered by it.
		Because people won&apos;t stop hassling me and pressuring me to acknowledge my birthday, I don&apos;t give them the information they need any more to continue that obnoxious behaviour.
	</p>
	<h4>People constantly tell me I need to watch X movie</h4>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not pop culture savvy.
		At all.
		People are surprised when I don&apos;t get references, and they pressure me to watch various movies so I will.
		I first try telling them I don&apos;t have a television (which is true) so I can&apos;t watch the movies.
		If they try to get me to get a <abbr title="digital versatile disc">DVD</abbr> to play on my computer, I explain what <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> is, the laws surrounding <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr>, and the fact that due to those laws, it&apos;d be illegal for me to watch <abbr title="digital versatile disc">DVD</abbr>s on my computer.
		Again, all of this is true.
		I explain that the <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> on <abbr title="digital versatile disc">DVD</abbr>s is actually quite trivial to break, so it&apos;s entirely possible for me to do so, but doing so is still illegal because I don&apos;t have an operating system with approved <abbr title="digital versatile disc">DVD</abbr> software.
		If they instead try to get me to use a service such as NetFlix, I explain what <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> is, the fact that NetFlix/whatever service uses it, and that my computer isn&apos;t compatible with such services because my computer has no <abbr title="digital restrictions management">DRM</abbr> software.
		Again, this is all true.
		I could pirate the movies they want me to watch, but again, that&apos;s illegal.
		There&apos;s just no legal way for me to watch movies given my setup.
		If they keep pushing, I tend to let it slide at that point, as they&apos;ve gotten the message I&apos;m not going to watch them and their last statement is something to the effect of &quot;oh, well you should watch them&quot; seemingly with the understanding that I probably actually won&apos;t do so.
	</p>
	<h3>Other people and pressure</h3>
	<p>
		Most of the time I see others dealing with pressure, they tend to give in but be upset about it.
		If there&apos;s enough pressure in both directions (for example, there&apos;s peer pressure to smoke and there&apos;s peer pressure not to smoke) they tend to go with what they want to do, but otherwise, they tend to fold.
		I think the difference is one of personality types.
		In the Myers-Briggs system, I&apos;m a mediator.
		We mediators stick to our principles against all else.
		Practicality has <strong>*nothing*</strong> on principles in our books.
		As mentioned previously, I&apos;ll argue for months just to get a straight answer ahead of being fed a self-contradicting lie.
		I would figuratively shoot myself in the foot just to avoid contradicting my principles.
		Others though, not so much.
		Mediators are a rare breed, and not all other personality types have the fortitude to stick with what they know to be right.
		Many other personality types tend to favour things such as practicality or ease ahead of principles.
	</p>
	<h3>Pro-social behaviour and altruism in my culture</h3>
	<p>
		Most of the pro-social behaviour and altruism I see is because of individuals with a conscience.
		There doesn&apos;t seem to be a cultural push for it.
		At least, not <strong>*true*</strong> pro-social behaviour or altruism.
		The massive companies engage in charitable acts for tax breaks, which means it&apos;s not truly pro-social or altruistic - rather, it&apos;s just for the bottom line, not to actually help anyone in outside the company.
		We do have some people that help out though.
		Back when I had more time and energy, I used to volunteer at a nearby food bank, for example.
		I&apos;d like to go back there, once I&apos;m out of school and recover from the depression induced by the school&apos;s censorship of me and my website.
		I feel no pressure to do so though.
		No one will care if I do or don&apos;t.
		No one will really know even, besides the people I volunteer with who have no idea who I even am.
		It&apos;s not really a cultural thing around here, it&apos;s just a personal desire to be a part of a solution rather than part of a problem.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Unit7">
	<h2>Unit 7</h2>
	<h3>My score</h3>
	<p>
		My score for the provided test was 44/29, which is a little over 1.5.
		I thought the score seemed a bit high until you take into account that the lowest score is one, not zero, which makes little sense.
		If you subtract one, you get a more meaningful number.
		At that point, I the score sounds about right.
	</p>
	<h3>Why this makes sense</h3>
	<p>
		On 2017-11-01, this school sent me a threatening letter demanding that I remove content they disagreed with from my website.
		If I refused, they said they&apos;d retroactively fail me from my courses and/or expel me from the school.
		The worst part was that they didn&apos;t even <strong>*try*</strong> nicely asking first.
		They just jumped straight to threatening me.
		When that happened, the stress was so much that I ended up in bed with a killer headache for a few days.
		The headache subsided eventually, but it was replaced by an extreme depression and lethargy.
		My website is how I express myself.
		It&apos;s my home on the Internet.
		The school barged into my home and censored me there.
		This has had a <strong>*severe*</strong> effect on my mental and emotional state.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since then, I&apos;ve noticed that my mental state has been declining even further.
		I can&apos;t take the stress of this; it&apos;s tearing me up inside.
		These days, I often can&apos;t find a reason to get out of bed if I don&apos;t have work that day.
		And even when I do, it&apos;s a struggle to force myself to get up and get dressed.
		The simple fact is that I&apos;m not doing well at all, mentally or emotionally.
		A score of zero point five out of a possible five makes perfect sense, given my situation and how it&apos;s been affecting me.
		I don&apos;t do well when I&apos;m being censored, nor <strong>*should*</strong> I be doing well when censored.
		I won&apos;t be doing well until I&apos;ve finished up my education and can leave this toxic school so I can recover.
	</p>
	<h3>Does this score change my thoughts?</h3>
	<p>
		No.
		No it does not.
		Every time I try to work toward improving anything in my life, even something minor, I find I lack the energy and motivation to get anything done.
		My coursework has gone from being a source of wonder to being yet another ball and chain dragging me down.
		Do you know that I used to have the bulk of my coursework done within the first couple days, then I&apos;d spend the rest of the time refining and improving it?
		These days, I barely even get my coursework done on time because I can&apos;t force myself to do it.
		I sometimes spend hours at a time just staring at the monitor, trying to make myself get even the slightest part done.
		With all that time lost, I sometimes even have to completely skip sleeping to make up for it and get my work done on time, and that deteriorates my mental and emotional health further, not to mention my physical health.
		I am well aware of how unhappy I am and how poorly I&apos;m doing.
		I even have an automated countdown clock built measuring how long I have left at this school to help me try to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
		Putting a numeric value on my unhappiness doesn&apos;t give me any new insight, as the symptoms are all so plainly obvious to me.
	</p>
	<h3>Do I want to make changes?</h3>
	<p>
		Of course I want to make changes!
		The school holds all the cards though.
		There&apos;s nothing I can do.
		The school has no right to censor me and make me feel this way, but yet I can&apos;t really stop them because they have the power to act on their unreasonable threats.
		Being poor, I can&apos;t afford to attend a better and less toxic school, so I&apos;m stuck.
		At this school, tuition is only $100 <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> per course.
		No other school I know competes with that.
		I just have to push my way through the garbage.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, the censorship&apos;s growing toll on me leaves me wondering if I can even make it.
	</p>
	<h3>The pleasant life, the good life, and the meaningful life</h3>
	<p>
		I suppose you could say I&apos;m missing two of these.
		Life is quite unbearable at the moment.
		The fact that I can&apos;t even get out of bed some days can attest to that.
		Obviously, life isn&apos;t pleasant for me.
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as the enrichment needed for a good life, I don&apos;t have anything particularly meaningful for others that I do, but I do put my skills toward a number of personal projects.
		I write and I program frequently.
		The school&apos;s censorship of me is putting a damper on my writing for the time being, but my programming fills me with a sense of accomplishment, even if I&apos;m the only one using most of my code.
		In particular, I have a sense of elation when I manage to solve a particularly difficult maths problem that&apos;s been bothering me.
		Much of the programming I do involves what basically amounts to algebra.
		Most of the time, I have the desired solution and must derive the problem from said solution, which can be difficult but rewarding.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for a meaningful life, I doubt I can ever have such a thing.
		I&apos;m well aware that the only purpose of life is to create more life.
		My one and only purpose is to breed.
		It&apos;s the one true purpose of any life form, humans included.
		I think breeding is the most evil thing I was ever capable of though.
		It goes against so much of what I believe in.
		We humans are killing off the planet, not to mention that the only cause of death is life.
		To cause new life is to cause death, with no exceptions.
		The most loving thing I could possibly do for my descendants is to not create them.
		It&apos;s not just my children, either.
		I&apos;d be direcltly responsible for the deaths of my children, but also indirectly responsible for the deaths of my grandchildren, great grandchildren, et cetera, until I was eventually responsible for more deaths even after my own than I&apos;ll ever be able to count.
		As such, I reject that purpose with every fibre of my being.
		I even got myself surgically sterilised just to prevent any incidents in the future.
		Even though I&apos;m still a virgin and haven&apos;t had to worry about such issues yet, it put my mind at ease to know the decision has already been laid to rest and no one can ever talk me out of it.
		Having done that, I&apos;ve accepted my fate of having a meaningless life.
		To breed is the most heinous act I could ever take part in.
		By getting myself sterilised, I forfeit the game of life by taking myself out of the gene pool.
		If I can&apos;t have a positive purpose, I&apos;d rather have no purpose, so I gave mine up.
		We can make up new purposes for ourselves, but they&apos;ll never be our actual purpose, and I don&apos;t think I could ever pretend otherwise.
		That said, I&apos;ve never needed a purpose in order to be happy.
		I&apos;m not one of those people that needs to feel important to enjoy life.

	<h2>Unit 8</h2>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve never really understood why any subject is considered taboo.
		It really seems like when we&apos;re not open about things, they tend to hold us back and/or hurt us much more than they otherwise would.
		There should be no such thing as a taboo subject, and if there is, there&apos;s a societal problem.
		For that reason, I&apos;m usually very open about everything.
		Something such as a substance addiction would be no different, if I had one, and I do freely discuss my non-substance addictions.
		Due to my addictive personality, I often get very addicted to specific types of computer games, for instance.
		When I let them take hold of me, I tend to get nothing useful done for weeks at a time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve also known to recovering meth addicts that were open about their pasts, and many more active tobacco addicts that are not only open about what they do, but about how bad it is.
		From what I&apos;ve seen, it really seems to me like substance addictions aren&apos;t as taboo to speak about among the people I interact with.
		I don&apos;t think it&apos;s as taboo a subject as it may once have been in the past.
		That said, I have no way to know if the people who are open are the outliers, if I&apos;m being honest.
		For every one of them that&apos;s open, there might be a dozen that aren&apos;t and I just don&apos;t know because I don&apos;t have the energy to notice the more subtle signs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think the dominant beliefs around here tend to be that these people need help, and frequently aren&apos;t going to be able to break their addictions alone.
		There seems to be less pressure than there once was on recovering from legal substance addictions though.
		I used to see ads recommending smokers get help all the time in various places, but now, I almost never see those any more.
		It&apos;s like the local population has stopped caring or something, which is really sad.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have seen stigmas against substance addicts, but usually mainly against those that aren&apos;t actively seeking help.
		I know at my workplace, a few of us were pressuring some of the smokers to make healthier choices.
		One of them &quot;quit&quot; several times, but tended to start back up again in a couple months each time.
		I can&apos;t speak for everywhere, but at least at my workplace, which is the only place I tend to interact with people where smoking is tolerated (for example, when interacting with people inside buildings, you&apos;re not going to see them smoking), people used to be someone encouraged to seek help and improve their lives.
		Much has changed since then though.
		The place has become so toxic that our turnover rate is through the roof.
		At this point, no one cares enough to try to help anyone any more.
		Personally, I&apos;m so bogged down by all the other garbage in my life such as my crippling depression.
		I don&apos;t have the energy to care what my workmates are doing out behind the building any more.
		As for everyone else, I think they probably don&apos;t care because no one really knows each other well due to no one staying for long.
		I like to think that other workplaces are similar to how mine used to be though.
