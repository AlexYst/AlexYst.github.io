<section id="Unit1">
	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<p>
		The learning journal assignment for the week asks us where databases are used in our own lives, meaning we should talk from our own experience, not use references.
		However, we&apos;re also told to include citations, which requires that we not discuss what&apos;s going on in our own lives, but instead get our information from another source.
		As you can see, these two instructions are contradictory to one another and following them is mutually exclusive.
		At first, I considered discussing the database locations covered by the book but filtering out the ones that don&apos;t have a presence in my life.
		I would then have a source to cite, yet what I write would still apply to my life as requested.
		For example, one area databases are mentioned as being used is in keeping track of telephone calls made, generating monthly bills for telephone service, and keeping track of balances on prepaid telephone cards.
		I don&apos;t have telephone service though.
		I live telephone free, and it&apos;s fantastic.
		I highly recommend it.
		Another purpose for which databases are said to be used is for aeroplane flight schedules.
		I don&apos;t fly anywhere though.
		Both of these highly-prevalent databases would be omitted from discussion if I were to filter what the textbook covered through the lens of relevancy to my own life.
		That seems more like an oversight than an aid to learning, though.
		With that in mind, I&apos;ll discuss where databases can be found using citations, regardless of whether said databases have a place in my own life.

		Financial institutions use databases to store accounts, loans, and transaction information <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		The textbook mentions banks, but all of this applies to credit unions as well.
		Additionally, the textbook mentions storing credit card transactions - a subset of transactions in general - in databases, as well as generating monthly bills using said databases <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		Reservations and schedules can be stored in databases.
		The textbook specifically mentions that airlines do this <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>, but it applies to other fields as well.
		For example, if you make an appointment with a medical professional, there&apos;s a good chance they keep track of said appointment via a database.
		I know every medical professional I can remember dealing with does this.
		For that matter, the account information mentioned as being used by banks also applies to a wide array of other businesses, each of which keeps an account with your name on it, including your doctors&apos; office.
		Universities keep accounts for students as well, which include information on registered and past courses in addition to grades.
		As mentioned above, telephone companies keep records on their customers as well.
		They track calls made, calls taken, and current (and often past) account balances.
		As can easily be predicted, they use this data for generating their monthly bills.
		They also use databases to store information about the status of their own network <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		Stocks and bonds are dealt with via databases as well <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		These are intangible concepts that really can&apos;t exist outside some sort of representation, such as a database.
		Many businesses of all sectors store customer information (when they can get their grubby mitts on it) as well as transactional information <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		Factories and warehouses use databases to track inventories, as well as information about products such as supply chains and orders.
		Employee information tends to be stored in databases too.
		This includes mostly information needed for generating pay cheques, such as salaries, wages, and hours worked, but also includes information on employee benefits, if any <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to databases being widely present in the world, they&apos;re also interacted with by nearly everyone in first-world countries.
		<abbr title="automated teller machine">ATM</abbr>s allow a user to make transactions without requiring a live teller to interact with the database on their behalf <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
		For that matter, many types of transactions within an account (such as moving money between sub-accounts) can also be done via a Web interface.
		For that matter, all sorts of database interactions occur over the Web.
		Even noxious tracking of your browsing habits done by companies so they can more-effectively pester you with relevant advertisements is an interaction between you and databases <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>, albeit an unwanted interaction.
		(I recommend installing <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>, from the <abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr>.)
		Likewise, those annoying automated telephone systems where you hit all the numbered keys to perform different tasks are database interfaces as well <a href="https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/476000/mod_book/chapter/187010/Database%20System%20Concepts%204th%20Edition%20By%20Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan.pdf">(Silberschatz-Korth-Sudarshan, 2001)</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basically, what it comes down to is this: organisations use databases to do database things.
		So to understand where databases are used, we need to understand what databases are good at, so we can know what &quot;database things&quot; are.
		When data is being gathered, it&apos;s usually getting stored in a database.
		Likewise, when data needs to be updatable, the data gets put in a database.
		The alternative (besides pen and paper or monolithic plain text files that have to be searched by hand; both of which technically qualify as databases, just not what we traditionally think of as databases these days) is to hard-code the data into the program.
		That&apos;s not feasible when data needs to be updatable.
		As for when data needs to be gathered, it&apos;s outright impossible in most cases.
		To add data to a system using hard-coding, you need a programmer on duty.
		Keeping a programmer on-duty at all times can be expensive, not to mention that such hard-coding of the data becomes tedious very quickly.
		The programmer&apos;s probably just going to program you a database and throw away the hard-coding.
		Databases allow for ever-changing data without the need to reprogram the system each time something is altered.
