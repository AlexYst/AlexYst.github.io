	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/01bool.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 01bool.pdf</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/02voc.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 02voc.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I suppose my main reaction is thinking that this is easier than I feared it&apos;d be.
		At least for this week, the material was pretty straightforward.
		It might be the case that search engines aren&apos;t as complex as I once thought they were.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The term has just begun, and no assignments have yet been submitted, so there isn&apos;t any feedback yet to report.
		As for interactions, the discussion board assignments have some limited interaction.
		From other students, I read mostly posts about positional indexes to supliment the research I&apos;d done for my own post about bi-word indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		My feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t really worth describing, as they don&apos;t really change much since the school administration started hassling me in various ways.
		Suffice to say though, my feelings and attitudes are quite a hindrance to getting my work done each week, but I always pull through in the end.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned how some types of indexing are performed as well as how indexes are searched.
		In particular, we focused on bi-word indexes and positional indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		One use for searching that I hadn&apos;t considered before is spell-checking.
		I guess I&apos;d never thought about how a spell-checker works.
		It&apos;s surprising to read that it&apos;s done using a searching algorithm, though in retrospect, I guess it shouldn&apos;t be <strong>*that*</strong> surprising.
		As for wondering, I wonder why an index would be referred to as an &quot;inverted index&quot;.
		An index, as defined by the reading material, is an inverted file.
		When you invert something and invert it again, you get back the original.
		However, an &quot;inverted index&quot; isn&apos;t the original file, but actually the same thing as a regular, uninverted index.
		It&apos;s a confusing misnomer, and I wonder why people come up with such counter-intuitive and outright incorrect terms to describe things.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		The only challenge this week was working up the motivation to get to work.
		Doing that has been difficult the past couple years due to garbage constantly thrown at me by the school staff.
		The professors, of course, are guilt-free of this, but the administration&apos;s behaviour has plunged me into a deep depression that makes it difficult to get anything done at all.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning not only how types of indexes are structured - which would be vital for constructing software that&apos;d generate an index for me - but also the strengths and weaknesses of different index formats.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t learn well in the sort of environment this school provides.
		I can get stuff done, but it&apos;s very laborious.
		I find I still have my former love of learning when I&apos;m studying things on my own, but as soon as I try to get going on coursework, I lose the will to actually learn anything.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m not sure.
		I can&apos;t help but feel that searching algorithms could come in very handy at some point, I&apos;m just not sure what I&apos;d use them for just yet.
		One thing that you have to keep in mind is that I&apos;m not a computer person by trade, but only by hobby.
		General business purposes don&apos;t really apply to me like they would students planning to go into database administration or something.
	</p>
	<p>
		I suppose one thing I might be able to use this for is for building a search system for my own website.
		It&apos;s a very small website, but it includes a public journal that&apos;s had daily entries added by me for the past several years.
		It might be nice to add a pre-generated list of pages relevant to various specific topics, and perhaps an auto-generated index could help build those lists.
		(As my site is entirely pre-compiled and static from the perspective of the reader, an actual search feature isn&apos;t possible.)

<section id="Unit2">
	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/03dict.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 03dict.pdf</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/04const.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 04const.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on index types and the programming assignment, which was barely an assignment at all.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		When I saw that the instructions for this week&apos;s assignment wanted us to use &quot;the current version of Python 2&quot;, I wondered how tricky that&apos;d be to get running.
		I thought for sure that Debian 10, my operating system, defaulted to Python 3.*, and I know that Python 3 isn&apos;t compatible with all Python 2 scripts.
		I knew 2.* and 3.* are both available in the Debian repository but I wasn&apos;t sure how to configure Debian to use 2.* if I installed it.
		Thankfully, running <code>python --version</code> showed me that I have 2.7.16 installed; that must be Debian&apos;s preinstalled default then.
		That was easy.
		Out of curiosity though, I checked online to see if this was indeed the current version.
		As it turns out, support for Python 2.7 is an end-of-life release for the 2.* series, and support for it was dropped on 2020-01-01.
		That means there <strong>*is no*</strong> &quot;current&quot; version of Python 2 any more.
		It&apos;s interesting that it&apos;s still the default in Debian then.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note, the assignment instructions also claims that while Windows uses forward slashes as directory separators in file paths while Linux uses backslashes.
		This is completely and absolutely false.
		Linux (and in fact most operating systems) uses <strong>*forward slashes*</strong> for path separators.
		Windows is the odd one out that uses backslashes.
		To try to be a bit compatible with normal file paths though, Windows does allow forward slashes to be used instead of backslashes though.
		So to put it simply, Windows uses both forward slashes and backslashes, while everyone else including Linux uses only forward slashes.
		I hope this gets fixed in the assignment instructions for next term.
		On the topic of incorrect information that should be updated, the assignment instructions also claim that the parts of the code shown in the instructions are in bold.
		The entire script is shown in italics, but nothing is in bold.
		I wouldn&apos;t necessarily say that the use of a bold type face should be used as it&apos;s easy to find the parts that need to be edited, but if a bold type face isn&apos;t used, the part claiming that it is should be removed.
		Hopefully, that too will be updated for next term.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the sounds of the instructions, the assignment was to modify the variable containing the path to the corpus of documents we were instructed to download, then add statistics reporting.
		The actual parsing of the files and the generation of the database files was already programmed for us, with the exception of a file that we&apos;d be programming the generation of in a later assignment.
		After verifying my Python setup and changing the one variable though, I just ran the script.
		I figured that if there were any errors in the code or my setup that interfered, I&apos;d catch and correct them before having put in any actual effort in developing anything.
		Much to my surprise though, the script output exactly the statistics we were instructed to have it report.
		Just like that.
		No effort on my part.
		At all.
		So ... I don&apos;t get the assignment.
		Was the assignment just to change one variable to reflect were we&apos;d extracted the files on our local machines?
		I&apos;m not complaining.
		It later turned out to be a long week for me and I had two nights where I didn&apos;t even go to bed and instead had to stay awake for about forty hours straight.
		An easy assignment that doesn&apos;t require me to spend another night sleepless was definitely welcome.
		It did seem rather underwhelming and pointless though.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The only feedback so far is for the learning journal, and thankfully, the professor this term seems fine with my format.
		I never know how I&apos;ll do on these open-ended learning journal assignments on the first week, as different professors have different preferences.
		I&apos;ve had professors mark me down for writing too much, then when I write less the next week to correct my mistake, they write me down for writing too little ...
		And some don&apos;t like the questions separated into sections with the questions used as headings and want it in free-form paragraph style, while some want the separate headings to make it easier to see that all the questions were answered ...
		Getting it right on the first week makes it easier to write my learning journal assignments on later weeks, as I can pretty much just do the same thing again.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		As mentioned <a href="#Unit1">last week</a>, my feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t great, but that&apos;s to be expected given my situation.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned more concretely how indexes are formatted.
		It&apos;s one thing to read it in a book, but it&apos;s another to actually see the output files generated by an indexer.
		Even though we didn&apos;t actually build the indexer - it was just given to us - we were still able to see the original files and the files built by the indexer.
		Were were also free to run the indexer on files of our own to experiment.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		It baffles me that blocked sort-based indexing uses document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s instead of file names and term strings.
		It seems rather arbitrary not to use the identifiers inherent to the things at hand and instead assign numeric identifiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s also surprising that the indexer we&apos;re working with assigns <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s starting from one instead of zero.
		It&apos;s counter-intuitive.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my main challenge.
		The work isn&apos;t difficult.
		Getting myself to even get started on the work, however, really is.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning the strengths and weaknesses of index formats.
		I don&apos;t think a blocked sort-based index would be right for me, were I to build an automated indexer for my website.
		I&apos;d want to be able to read the index by hand to see what had been indexed, and the document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s being used instead of file names and term strings would make it incredibly hard to do that.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t do well here; not that there&apos;s anything I can do about it.
		I muddle through, but it&apos;s very stressful and I end up having to spend sleepless nights to get anything done.
		Twice this week, I had to pull all-nighters and stay awake for about forty hours at a time.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m still not sure.
		I&apos;m still not sure I&apos;d ever need to build an index of anything.
		There&apos;s a chance I might build one for my website, which I brought up the possibility of last week, though I don&apos;t see me getting to that any time soon.
		I have so many sub-projects for my website that I just haven&apos;t gotten to, and an indexer would be pretty low on the list, not to mention that I&apos;ve got non-website stuff going on as well.
		The thing you have to understand is that I&apos;ll probably never even apply for a computer-related job.
		I program as a hobby, not for employment.
	</p>
	<p>
		These sorts of questions are sort of odd; I&apos;m not sure why assignments ask them of students.
		The required courses for a degree are so varied that the topics of every course a student takes can&apos;t apply to every student.
		To put that another way, every student is asked how the material applies to them, but in most cases, the student took the course because it&apos;s required for the degree and not because the material will ever be relevant to them.
		For example, required courses at this school include this course on information retrieval, a course on Web development, a course on Linux, a course on Windows, a course on <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> graphics, a course on Java, and a course on Python, among others.
		What profession makes use of all of that?
		Don&apos;t get me wrong, the material of this course is interesting, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll use it in a meaningful context.
		I know for a fact that the material from the Windows course isn&apos;t something I&apos;ll ever use.
