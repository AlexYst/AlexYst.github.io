			<h1>Repressed memories</h1>

<p>
	I used to believe in the idea of repressed memories.
	After reading my article for the week though, I&apos;m not really sure what to think any more.
	I guess I&apos;m more on the side of thinking the concept is a misrepresentation of what&apos;s really going on.
</p>
<p>
	According to the New York Times, there haven&apos;t been any reported cases of repressed memory resurfacing before the year 1800, where it was starting to become used as a plot device in stories (Carey, 2007).
	This seems to suggest that it&apos;s not an actual phenomenon.
	It may be based on a real phenomenon, but it&apos;s probably blown way out of proportion.
	It certainly wouldn&apos;t be the first time such has happened.
	For example, stories often use hypnosis as a plot device, allowing characters to control other characters without their consent.
	Hypnosis is a very real phenomenon.
	However, hypnosis isn&apos;t mind control.
	You might be able to get a hypnotised person to perform a bunch of silly actions during a show, but the person is still well aware of their actions and cannot be made perform actions that would violate their ethics and values.
	You can&apos;t hypnotise someone to rob a bank, for example.
	You can hypnotise them into clucking like a chicken though, because clucking like a chicken isn&apos;t something people usually find ethical fault with.
	Quicksand is another example of things that get embellished for stories.
	Quicksand is real, and it&apos;s pretty much a mix of sand and water.
	Sand is made of stone, which makes it very dense.
	Humans <strong>*float*</strong> on quicksand; we don&apos;t get sucked down into it!
	I imagine quicksand isn&apos;t very fun to swim through, and if you step in some thinking that it&apos;s solid ground, you&apos;re going to get a nasty surprise, but you&apos;re not going to get pulled down into it with no hope of escape.
	Just grab onto the bank you just walked off of and pull yourself out.
</p>
<p>
	Another thing the article brings up is that traumatic memories are usually very vivid (Carey, 2007).
	It&apos;s believed that this is because such memories are more important than calm memories.
	A memory of a traumatic experience serves as a warning, keeping you wary so you can avoid the threatening subject of said memory in the future.
	So if this is the case, why would our brains repress traumatic memories?
	Doing so would be detrimental, as we wouldn&apos;t remember the danger and could unknowingly expose ourselves to risks that would otherwise be avoided.
	From an evolutionary standpoint, the idea of repressing memories because they&apos;re too horrible just doesn&apos;t make any sense.
	Avoiding the pain of those memories isn&apos;t healthy, and you&apos;re likely to just experience the original pain of the event again when it gets repeated due to your not avoiding the dangerous situation.
</p>
<p>
	One idea proposed was that perhaps when the memory is <strong>*too*</strong> traumatic, it causes certain systems in the brain to break down (Carey, 2007).
	By this logic, a repressed memory would be caused by the brain being unable to handle the memory properly.
	Something breaks inside you.
	But if this is the case, why would people with repressed memories seem so fine emotionally until the memory resurfaces?
	If something has broken them or is overloading their brain&apos;s capacity to function properly, why would they be fine until the memory resurfaces?
	Keep in mind, too, that the brain has still stored the memory.
	Otherwise, the memory couldn&apos;t resurface.
	This means that the memory hasn&apos;t been lost and its loss is allowing them to be fine.
	While their conscious mind might not be able to access the memory, the brain is still aware of it the whole time.
	If the memory is actually causing such a breakdown, how can the person lead a healthy, happy, and functional life while the memory is still existing in the brain?
</p>
<p>
	In the end, what the article concluded was that &quot;repressed memories&quot; likely aren&apos;t repressed at all (Carey, 2007).
	As children, we experience a lot of things we just don&apos;t understand.
	We store memories on these things, but we store them as mysterious things we don&apos;t understand at the time, not as traumatic events.
	We don&apos;t think about such things, because it&apos;s been so long since they were relevant to the current day.
	Every once in a while though, we&apos;ll think about one of these memories.
	When we do, we&apos;re able to apply our current experience to what we didn&apos;t understand in the past.
	We&apos;re able to recategorise these mysteries as something more concrete and specific.
	And sometimes, our new understandings of past events are traumatic.
	We don&apos;t remember these traumatic memories because the events weren&apos;t actually traumatic to us at the time.
	It&apos;s the looking back on them with newfound understanding and realising that such horrible things happened to us that is actually when the trauma occurs.
	In the example given in the article, a family member may make sexual advances toward a child.
	The child doesn&apos;t understand what&apos;s going on, so the event gets filed as a mystery.
	Later, the adult the child grew into thinks about old times, and realises exactly what such advances meant.
	They realise that they were sexually abused, and that realisation is the trauma-causing event for them.
	They had no reason to repress the memory before, as they didn&apos;t even know what the memory meant at the time.
	And after realising, they don&apos;t repress it because it has retroactively become a traumatic memory and gets refiled in their memories as such.
