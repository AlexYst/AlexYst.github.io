		The reading assignment for the week was as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For this week&apos;s learning journal assignment, we&apos;re supposed to discuss the parts of the reading assignment we had trouble with.
		That leaves me not really knowing what to write.
		None of it was a difficult read.
		The only difficult part was finding the time to sit down and read it.
		To begin the week, I read the part on velocity, so I could complete the discussion assignment.
		I hadn&apos;t read anything relevant to the written assignment yet though when I completed the written assignment.
		It probably took me under an hour using what I&apos;d learned prior to starting this course.
		I suppose I had a slight problem with the third and final question, though that&apos;s obviously not a part of the reading assignment.
		Though a simple problem, trying to balance an equation with sine and cosine working with 2<var>x</var> instead of just one <var>x</var> kind of overwhelmed me a little bit, but I knew what I had to do as a first step if I was going to get anywhere.
		I had to ignore the two, and just remember to divide my solution by two later.
		Doing that, the rest actually fell into place right away.
		I remembered enough about sine and cosine to remember that I was looking for the point on a unit circle relating to a forty-five degree angle, and I remembered that when working on a unit circle using sine and cosine, three-sixty degrees is two pi radians.
		With that, I knew my solution was just 0.25π.
		I checked it with a calculator to be sure, but that did turn out right.
		I almost forgot to divide it by two to get a solution of 0.125π radians though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Later in the week after completing the written assignment, I went back and read the reading assignment.
		Having completed the written assignment without having read the material for the week, I expected the material to be mostly review for me, and I wasn&apos;t wrong.
		I don&apos;t remember several of the equations I read, if I&apos;m being honest.
		And the ones I remember now, I&apos;ll likely soon forget.
		I really don&apos;t have the greatest memory.
		That said, I should be able to remember the terminology and the basic concepts.
		If and when I need the equations, I should be able to look them up from what I remember about the surrounding material.
		I do that sort of thing all the time with other mathematical expressions and concepts.
		I use maths often enough that I&apos;ve had to learn to get around my limited memory and figure out how to re-find the equations I can&apos;t recall when I need them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not sure what this week&apos;s discussion assignment was supposed to enlighten us with.
		We were to discuss ways that velocity could be used in everyday life.
		Everything we do involves velocity in a multitude of ways, so I (and it seems all the other students) instead discussed how knowing the velocity of something could be helpful and what we could calculate from that.
		Using a known velocity, you can predict and plan, but people old enough to attend university courses should already be familiar with doing that.
		It could be that I was missing something in the intent of the assignment though.
		It wouldn&apos;t be the first time.

	<p>
		The reading material for the week was as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Sections 2.1 through 2.3 of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/MITRES_18_001_strang_2124.pdf">Calculus Online Textbook Chapter 2 Sections 2.1 to 2.4 - MITRES_18_001_strang_2124.pdf</a>

			Section 2.6 of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/MITRES_18_001_strang_2527.pdf">Calculus Online Textbook Chapter 2 Sections 2.5 to 2.7 - MITRES_18_001_strang_2527.pdf</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The definition of converging at zero (or converging at any number) took me by surprise.
		I would think that numbers in a sequence would be required to get increasingly closer to meet the definition.
		However, they only have to eventually go below an arbitrary threshold distance from the number (such as zero) and stay there.
		They can even go below that threshold, back out and become too far away, then go back below the threshold and stay there.
		As long as there is eventually a point of no return, it still counts.
		This allows some odd examples to qualify.
		For example, one sequence brought up by the book had all evenly-indexed numbers in the sequence (sequence item 0, sequence item 2, sequence item 4, et cetera) have half the value of the previous evenly-indexed sequence item.
		Oll the odd-indexed values were simply zero.
		With every two steps, the value would be zero, then back away from zero.
		Still, the sequence was considered to converge at zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to understand the definition presented for derivatives, but I just wasn&apos;t getting it.
		I tried rereading that section several times, but I just wasn&apos;t getting anywhere.
		Eventually, I did a Web search and ended up at Wikipedia, which explained the topic in more-plain language.
		One thing I&apos;m still not getting though is why delta is used in some cases while de is used in others.
		I know delta as frequently being used to refer to differences, so it was easy to pick up on the material&apos;s use of delta, but it seems that the reading material is using de instead but only sometimes.
		I&apos;m not sure when each is supposed to be used or if the two are interchangeable.
		Even with the Wikipedia article though, I still wasn&apos;t understanding how to calculate derivatives.
		So I consulted a derivative calculator that broke down the steps for me.
		I entered an equation to find the derivative of, and looked at what it was doing.
		It didn&apos;t really explain the steps very well, and only showed what they were.
		I notices some patterns though, so I engaged in a little exercise: I modified the numbers in my equation and tried to calculate the derivative before submitting the equation to the calculator.
		At first, I got it wrong.
		The patterns I&apos;d noticed were incomplete.
		I noticed more-complete versions of the patterns from my mistakes though, and began to get all the answers right.
	</p>
	<p>
		I still don&apos;t at all understand the reasoning behind derivatives, but at least I can now calculate them using the power rule.
		You multiply the constant value by the exponent, then multiply by <var>x</var> to the original exponent decremented by one.
		It looks like there&apos;s something called the common derivative too, which is when there is no exponent, you just drop the variable.
		That seems like a spacial case of the power rule though.
		<var>x</var> is equal to <var>x</var><sup>1</sup>, so if you apply the power rule instead of the common derivative, the <var>x</var> value disappears because it becomes <var>x</var><sup>0</sup>, which is one.
		One multiplied by the constant then yields just the constant.
		And finally, the derivative of a constant is zero.
		At first, I thought it to relate to the power rule again.
		That just doesn&apos;t seem to fit though.
		My current working theory is that instead, because we&apos;re looking at the rate of change, the constant is meaningless.
		If you add five, for example, to both your starting and ending points, the change between the two remains itself unchanged.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the grading instructions for last week&apos;s work, I noticed the solution was specified in enumerated set notation.
		I hadn&apos;t thought of doing that in my submission.
		My bad.
		I simply provided two possible answers and pointed out that there were an infinite number of solutions.
		I find enumerated set notation to be difficult to read and difficult to write, so it&apos;s no wonder that I didn&apos;t go with that particular way of recording my answer.
		However, I could have used a couple of equations, and specified that the variable in the equation could be any integer.
		That would have been a much more complete answer for my to provide.

		The reading material for the week was as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Section 2.4 of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/MITRES_18_001_strang_2124.pdf">Calculus Online Textbook Chapter 2 Sections 2.1 to 2.4 - MITRES_18_001_strang_2124.pdf</a>

		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d had a problem with the reading material.
		However, I couldn&apos;t figure out the third question on the assignment for the week, so clearly, I missed something important.
		The question asked that we supply a function that approaches infinity as the input gets closer to the limit of three.
		That part was easy.
		This happens when you divide by zero, so my function just needed to divide by three minus its input.
		However, the next part is where things fell apart.
		The output of the function multiplied by three minus the input needs to approach zero as the input approaches three.
		This multiplication undid my division.
		The result was whatever my numerator was in my function.
		I tried using the input in the numerator, exponents in the numerator, exponents in the denominator ...
		Nothing seemed to work.
		I&apos;m not sure what I was supposed to do, but everything I did either failed the second condition or broke the function causing it to fail the first condition.
		What seemed to be the issue was that for the function to not cancel out the multiplication performed on its output, it needs to output numbers no greater than one near the limit.
		However, this is the exact sort of thing that it can&apos;t do while also outputting results that grow increasingly close to infinity.
		These are contradictory goals.
		Clearly, there&apos;s something I failed to grasp from the reading material.
		There&apos;s some key piece of information - probably something rather simple, too - that I&apos;m overlooking.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;m not the only one overlooking things though.
		On last week&apos;s assignment, I couldn&apos;t figure out how to properly solve the problem in which we needed to find the limit of a function without being able to see what the function did.
		I ended up pulling in what we&apos;d done in the discussion assignment, and believed the limit to be caused by a division-by-zero error.
		This wasn&apos;t the case, according to the answer key we used to grade the work this week though.
		Instead, the solution was supposed to be f&apos;(3).
		I have no idea where that solution even came from, and the answer key doesn&apos;t explain it.
		However, all three students that I graded work for this week provided a different answer.
		They all thought the answer was 24.
		The consistency here of them all finding the same wrong answer makes me think that the reading material might have covered it in a way that wasn&apos;t as clear as it should have been and easily taken to mean something else, or that it wasn&apos;t covered and that the other students used some other part of the reading material incorrectly because we didn&apos;t have the correct information.
		Then again, maybe we&apos;re just all bad at maths and the material covered the matter very well.
		I&apos;m not sure.
	</p>
	<p>
		The quiz was an odd experience this week.
		It was mostly easy, but there were some questions I just couldn&apos;t find the answer I&apos;d arrived at in the list of choices.
		I kept panicking and trying to figure out where I&apos;d gone wrong, only to realise a bit later that the solutions in the multiple-choice list were just presented with the terms in a different order.
		For example, one solution had an <var>h</var> term and a <var>t</var> term.
		I normalise my solutions by alphabetising, while the solution provided had the terms in reverse order.
		And then there was the final problem.
		It asked which line had the same slope as the one provided.
		In other words, just ignore the <var>b</var> term and look for the matching <var>m</var> term.
		I kind of stared at it a bit, trying to figure out what the trick was.
		It was just <strong>*too*</strong> easy of a question, so I thought I might be misinterpreting it.

	<p>
		The reading material for the week was as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Sections 3.1 through 3.3 of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/MITRES_18_001_strang_3134.pdf">Calculus Online Textbook Chapter 3 Sections 3.1 to 3.4 - MITRES_18_001_strang_3134.pdf</a>

		<li>
			Section 3.5 of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/MITRES_18_001_strang_3538.pdf">Calculus Online Textbook Chapter 3 Sections 3.5 to 3.8 - MITRES_18_001_strang_3538.pdf</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This was a pretty easy week, and I didn&apos;t have any difficulty with the material.
		I wasn&apos;t sure what the discussion assignment was asking for though.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the written assignment, this was our easiest yet.
		I did hit a couple of snags, but nothing major.
		For some reason, I tackled this assignment in reverse, answering the third question, the second question, then the first question.
		In my submission, I arranged the answers in the correct order, so there&apos;s not going to be any problems with the grading, I just didn&apos;t solve them in order.
	</p>
	<p>
		The third question took some thinking.
		At first glance, I thought the graph of the equation would be a horizontal line, though it didn&apos;t turn out that way.
		I&apos;m not sure why I thought it would.
		One <var>x</var>  in the numerator would obviously cancel with the denominator, but the other wouldn&apos;t.
		Still, the equation did present a straight line as I&apos;d thought it would, so finding the value that would fill the hole in the line at the equation&apos;s limit was easy.
		It took me a bit to remember the other way of solving limits; the one that works for normal equations that don&apos;t reduce to something simpler.
	</p>
	<p>
		I find it odd how we can reduce equations such as these, and yet the reduction isn&apos;t completely equivalent to the original.
		Because the reduced form doesn&apos;t have the same divide-by-zero possibility, we can actually look directly at the value of the limit after reducing instead of getting slightly closer to the value over several iterations and attempting to guess what the convergence value is.
		And that&apos;s what it feels like to me: a guess, or more accurately, and estimation.
		The value may appear to converge on an integer, for example, but might actually be converging on a fractional value just a hair&apos;s width away from said integer.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second problem was interesting.
		We were supposed to find where on an equation curved concave up.
		I would think that we should solve this using equations, but instead, it was specifically hinted that we should use a graph instead.
		That made the problem way too easy.
		I&apos;m kind of surprised though that the terms used are concave up and concave down though.
		I would think that one would be considered concave and the other convex.
		Concave up and concave down are easier to remember though, as you don&apos;t have to remember which side of the line you&apos;re looking from when labelling it as convex or concave.
		With the terms convex and concave, you need a perspective, or they&apos;ll basically be the same thing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried a few different graphing calculators for that problem, but I couldn&apos;t get any of them to limit the drawn curve to the requested range.
		For the screenshot I included as the graph in my submission, I ended up just setting the viewport, so while the curve was drawn off infinitely in both directions, it just couldn&apos;t be seen beyond the specified range.
		What makes this even odder is that one calculator I tried specifically had menu options for limiting the input range, but it seemed to ignore any number I entered.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first question was kind of unremarkable.
		Maybe that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t feel like starting with it.
		We were supposed to find a minimum on a parabola, and that just required plugging numbers into basic equations.
		Of course, I didn&apos;t remember the equations.
		I almost never do.
		But it&apos;s easy enough to look them up when you need them.

	<h2>Unit 5</h2>
	<p>
		The reading material for the week was <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/MITRES_18_001_strang_4142.pdf">Calculus Online Textbook Chapter 4 Sections 4.1 to 4.2 - MITRES_18_001_strang_4142.pdf</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Last week&apos;s coursework had a question that specifically told us to use a graph to solve it.
		So I did that.
		However, the answer key we were presented with this week wanted a precise answer in the form of an irrational number that could only be found through calculation.
		There&apos;s absolutely no way to get such answers from a graph.
		I&apos;d&apos;ve gotten the answer right if we weren&apos;t misleadingly told to graph the problem to solve it.
		That&apos;s rather frustrating; the instructions were a lie.
		I&apos;m not falling for that again.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only problem that presented any difficultly this week was the third one.
		Once more, it told us to use a graph.
		Like I said, I&apos;m not falling for that lie again.
		This time, I used cold, hard calculations to arrive an an answer.
		That wasn&apos;t even the challenging part though.
		First, while I can calculate regular derivatives, I&apos;m still not clear on what they actually are or what they&apos;re for.
		And now we&apos;re working with implicit derivatives?
		I&apos;m even more confused.
		I think my calculations were accurate, but they took some time to figure out.
		By the time I&apos;d finished, I&apos;d forgotten the context of the problem too, and had forgotten that finding the implicit derivative wasn&apos;t even the end goal.
		I nearly submitted the assignment with just that!
		Luckily, I read back over my work and noticed what I&apos;d forgotten: I&apos;d forgotten the final step of plugging the ordered pairs into the implicit derivative&apos;s equation to get the actual solution to what the problem had asked for.
	</p>
	<p>
		The learning journal assignment this week asks us to tell what we came across as a result of this week&apos;s material that makes us curious or makes us want to learn more.
		Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have a proper answer for that, given my situation.
		This school has drained the joy of learning from me.
		I came to this school excited about every course and its material, but after a couple years of the school censoring me, the school frequently registering me from courses lately for no valid reason, and my being blown off by school staff when I try to discuss these sorts of issues, coursework has become absolute drudgery to me.
		I get through, and that&apos;s all.
		There is no excitement or curiosity for me here any more.
		To be clear, it&apos;s not the professors.
		Every professor I&apos;ve had here has either been great or at least not been outright harmful to my mental state, but the higher departments are plagued with issues that drain the fun of learning from me.
		It&apos;s gotten to the point that I coded up a countdown to show me how many more days I&apos;m stuck at this school before I can graduate and be free.
		It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t appreciate the subjects, either.
		I&apos;m one of those people who actually does algebra for fun, believe it or not, in the form of writing computer code using equations with variables, and when I&apos;m not actively held back like this, I&apos;m a highly curious individual.
	</p>
	<p>
		The assignment asks us to choose an interesting problem from the reading material and solve it.
		I chose problem seven: using implicit differentiation on the equation <var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>y</var> = <var>y</var><sup>2</sup><var>x</var>.
		It seemed a bit complex, and it requires the finding of an implicit derivative which I need more practice at, so I figured I&apos;d work with it.
		First, I needed to work with each side of the expression individually.
		I started with the left side.
		I started with the product rule.
		This told me that (<var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>y</var>)&apos; = (<var>x</var><sup>2</sup>)&apos;<var>y</var> + <var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>y</var>&apos;.
		Next, I used the power rule.
		(<var>x</var><sup>2</sup>)&apos; = 2<var>x</var>.
		Putting that together, the derivative of the left half is 2<var>x</var><var>y</var> + <var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>y</var>&apos;.
		For the right side, I again applied the product rule, this time getting <var>x</var>(<var>y</var><sup>2</sup>)&apos; + <var>x</var>&apos;<var>y</var><sup>2</sup>.
		I then applied the chain rule on (<var>y</var><sup>2</sup>)&apos; to get (<var>y</var><sup>2</sup>)&apos;<var>y</var>&apos;.
		The power rule let me convert (<var>y</var><sup>2</sup>)&apos; into 2<var>y</var>, so (<var>y</var><sup>2</sup>)&apos;<var>y</var>&apos; became 2<var>y</var><var>y</var>&apos;.
		<var>x</var>&apos; = 1, and multiplication by one can just be dropped form the equation, so that left me with 2<var>x</var><var>y</var><var>y</var>&apos; + <var>y</var><sup>2</sup>.
		My total equation at this point was 2<var>x</var><var>y</var> + <var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>y</var>&apos; = 2<var>x</var><var>y</var><var>y</var>&apos; + <var>y</var><sup>2</sup>.
		From here, it was just a matter of shifting around the variables:
	</p>
	<ol start="0">
		<li>
			2<var>x</var><var>y</var> + <var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>y</var>&apos; = 2<var>x</var><var>y</var><var>y</var>&apos; + <var>y</var><sup>2</sup> [starting point]
		</li>
		<li>
			<var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>y</var>&apos; = 2<var>x</var><var>y</var><var>y</var>&apos; + <var>y</var><sup>2</sup> - 2<var>x</var><var>y</var> [subtract 2<var>x</var><var>y</var> from both sides]
		</li>

		The reading material for the week was <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/MITRES_18_001_strang_6164.pdf">Calculus Online Textbook Chapter 6 Sections 6.1 to 6.4 - MITRES_18_001_strang_6164.pdf</a>
	</p>

		The problem I struggled on the most this week was the one asking us to find the derivatives of two different equations in two different ways.
		The chain rule method was a working first method, but I had no idea what second method I was supposed to do.
		I could have rearranged some of the steps after having applied the chain rule, but that felt like cheating and didn&apos;t seem to be what was likely being asked for anyway, so I ende dup submitting my work with only one method used.
		I&apos;m seriously not sure what else I was supposed to use.
		It&apos;d be nice if the assignment actually asked for what it wanted from us.
		I mean, if the goal is just to find the derivatives, then one method is just fine.
		I think instead, some specific methods of derivative-finding were wanted, but the assignment didn&apos;t ask for them by name.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like last week, the learning journal assignment asks about what we&apos;re excited about based on this week&apos;s material.
		Nothing has changed since last week.
		As before, my current situation doesn&apos;t really allow me to be excited about the material, despite my love of maths.
		I could repeat my answer form last week, but it&apos;d be redundant.
	</p>
	<p>
		For my learning journal problem this week, I went with one of the written-answer problems instead of one of the equation-solving problems.
		Equation-solving seems more-involved, which is why I chose a calculation problem last week, but I thought I&apos;d try something different this week.
		One question asks about why the natural log of <var>n</var> is near the sum of the fractions with one as a numerator and two through <var>n</var> as denominators.
		It also asks whether the sum of fractions is higher or lower than the natural log.
		The obvious answer as to why the two are near one another is that the natural log is logarithmic, meaning that the higher that <var>n</var> goes, the less <var>n</var> adds to the result, while the sum of fractions also adds less for each increment of <var>n</var> because as the denominators increase, the values of the fractions decrease.
		This seemed like too unspecific of an answer though, so let&apos;s look a bit deeper.
		The natural logarithm is can also be thought of as log<sub>e</sub>(<var>n</var>).
		e is defined as the limit of the equation (1 + 1/<var>n</var>)<sup><var>n</var></sup>, which turns out to be around 2.7.
		The exponential decrease in the sum of fractions should be close to log<sub>3.44</sub>(<var>n</var>).
		I&apos;m not sure exactly what logarithm approximates this curve, but log<sub>3.44</sub>(<var>n</var>) seems to get close.
		2.7 isn&apos;t all that far from 3.44, so the curves are pretty close to one another.
		Or at least, they are for small numbers.
		The question implies that they remain close for their entirety, but they do drift apart as the value of <var>n</var> increases.
		As for which one is higher, the natural log is higher.
		With a smaller base, the amount of increase doesn&apos;t drop quite as quickly as the sum of fractions does, so it provides a higher output.

		The learning journal asks us to write about one homework problem that we struggled with and how the struggle was helpful to us.
		I assume the &quot;homework&quot; was the written assignment.
		The assignment was actually rather easy though, aside form the final problem.
		In that problem, I didn&apos;t quite understand what was being asked of us.
		I solved it the way I thought was intended, which was easy enough, but I was never really sure that what I&apos;d done was what I was supposed to do.
		I wouldn&apos;t say that that struggle was helpful in any way.
		It was a struggle in communication, not a struggle with the actual material.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though not what I&apos;d call the homework, the discussion assignment was a struggle.
		I ended up having to look into outside resources to try to get my post written up.
		Looking into outside resources helped me understand the mechanics of the problem, I think, so in that way, the struggle helped.
		However, I think the information I found was inaccurate.
		The other students didn&apos;t call me out on my bad information, but after seeing the other posts, I&apos;m pretty sure mine was wrong.
		At least I was able to get my bad understanding of the material corrected in time for the written assignment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like before, the discussion assignment asks us to discuss what about the material excites us and makes us want to learn more.
		As before, I&apos;m not in a position in which excitement or enthusiasm is an option.
		I can work with the material, but asking me to be excited over it is asking more than I can give for the time being.
	</p>
	<p>
		For my learning journal problem for the week, I decided to find the antiderivative of <var>x</var> + 12<var>x</var><sup>2</sup>, then find the definite integral.
		It doesn&apos;t show much in writing, as you see my finished work all at once, but I struggle with finding antiderivatives in which I can&apos;t directly apply a rule such as the power rule.
		It&apos;s hard for me to work backwards like that, so I need more practice.
		For example, the <var>x</var> term here.
		I read it as 1<var>x</var><sup>1</sup>, and that doesn&apos;t quite allow me to apply the power rule to it because I need the multiplication term to be one grater than the exponential term.
		It might not be a struggle for me if I wasn&apos;t under as much stress, but it takes me a while to figure out what I need to do to sort of separate out things that aren&apos;t there in order to make them exist.
		Here, in this example, I need to factor out one half, so I have 2<var>x</var><sup>1</sup>/2, which can then have the power rule applied to get <var>x</var><sup>2</sup>/2.
		The 12<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> term is easier for me for some reason.
		I can just factor out the existing 4, getting (4)3<var>x</var><sup>2</sup>.
		Applying the power rule there gets us 4<var>x</var><sup>3</sup>.
		Of course, we have to add our constant term, so the antiderivatives in whole are <strong><var>x</var><sup>2</sup>/2 + 4<var>x</var><sup>3</sup> + <var>c</var>, where <var>c</var> is every real number</strong>.
		Now for the easy part: the definite integral.
		I&apos;m not clear on what those are for, but they&apos;re easy to calculate.
		Just plug both zero and one into the function and subtract the results.
		0<sup>2</sup>/2 + 4(0)<sup>3</sup> + <var>c</var> = <var>c</var>, while 1<sup>2</sup>/2 + 4(1)<sup>3</sup> + <var>c</var> = 9/2 + <var>c</var>.
		Subtracting (9/2 + <var>c</var>) - <var>c</var> gives us simply nine halves, which is 4.5.

	<h2>Unit 8</h2>
	<h3>Use substitution to find ʃ <var>x</var>(<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4)<sup>2</sup> d<var>x</var></h3>
	<p>
		The term &quot;substitution&quot; makes it sound like we&apos;re substituting concrete values for <var>x</var> or something, but that&apos;s not what&apos;s meant here at all.
		The substitution rule is just the inverse of the chain rule, so we&apos;re basically just inverse chaining.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, we define a new variable.
		By convention, we tent to use <var>u</var>.
		We&apos;ll set <var>u</var> equal to <var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4, so ʃ <var>x</var>(<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4)<sup>2</sup> d<var>x</var> = ʃ <var>x</var><var>u</var><sup>2</sup> d<var>x</var>.
		We then need to take the derivative of <var>u</var> so we can properly apply the substitution rule.
		<var>u</var> = <var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4, and we drop the constant term of 4 when finding the derivative.
		We&apos;re then looking for the derivative of <var>x</var><sup>2</sup>.
		To get that, we apply the power rule, which gives us 2<var>x</var><sup>1</sup>, which is simply 2<var>x</var>.
		We need to pull a 2<var>x</var> out of ʃ <var>x</var><var>u</var><sup>2</sup> d<var>x</var>, so we divide by one half to get (½)ʃ 2<var>x</var><var>u</var><sup>2</sup> d<var>x</var>
		For clarity, we rearrange this as (½)ʃ <var>u</var><sup>2</sup> * 2<var>x</var> d<var>x</var>, then apply the requested substitution rule to get (½)ʃ <var>u</var><sup>2</sup> d<var>u</var>.
		Next, we want to apply the inverted power rule to <var>u</var><sup>2</sup>, so we need to get it into <var>n</var><var>u</var><sup><var>n</var> - 1</sup> form.
		We see that the exponent is 2, so we need the multiplier to be three.
		To get it in that form, we divide by one third and add a one-third multiplier.
		This gives us (½) ʃ (⅓)3<var>u</var><sup>2</sup> d<var>u</var>.
		Applying the inverted power rule gives us (½)(⅓)<var>u</var><sup>3</sup>.
		Multiplying the fractions together gives us (⅙)<var>u</var><sup>3</sup>.
		Now, we replace <var>u</var> with its original value of <var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4, giving us (⅙)(<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4)<sup>3</sup>, or ((<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4)<sup>3</sup>)/6.
		Finally, we add our unknown constant, <var>c</var>, to get <strong>(⅙)(<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4)<sup>3</sup> + <var>c</var> or ((<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> - 4)<sup>3</sup>)/6 + <var>c</var>, where <var>c</var> is any real number</strong>.
	</p>
	<h3>Find ʃ<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup> sin<sup>3</sup>(<var>x</var>)cos(<var>x</var>) d<var>x</var></h3>
	<p>
		First, we set <var>u</var> equal to sin(<var>x</var>).
		The derivative of sin(<var>x</var>) is known to be cos(<var>x</var>), so we can apply the inverted chain rule right away.
		This gives us ʃ<sub>0</sub><sup>π</sup> <var>u</var><sup>3</sup> d<var>u</var>.
		We then apply the inverted power rule, getting us <var>u</var><sup>4</sup>/4.
		Finally, we substitute <var>u</var> out for its original value of sin(<var>x</var>) and add unknown constant <var>c</var>, giving us sin<sup>4</sup>(<var>x</var>)/4 + <var>c</var>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I said &quot;finally&quot;, but there&apos;s still more to do.
		We have the antiderivative, but we now need to plug the upper and lower bounds into the antiderivative and subtract to get the definite integral.
		sin<sup>4</sup>(0) is zero, and sin<sup>4</sup>(π) is also zero.
		That gives us (0 + <var>c</var>) - (0 + <var>c</var>).
		The <var>c</var>s cancel out, and zero minus zero is zero, <strong>giving us a final answer of zero</strong>.
	</p>
	<h3>Evaluate ʃ<sub>1</sub><sup>e<sup>2</sup></sup> 5/<var>x</var> d<var>x</var></h3>
	<p>
		Again, we need to find the antiderivative.
		First, we apply the linearity rule, giving us 5ʃ<sub>1</sub><sup>e<sup>2</sup></sup> 1/<var>x</var> d<var>x</var>.
		We can then use a standard integral.
		The antiderivative of 1/<var>x</var> is ln(<var>x</var>), and we need to apply unknown constant <var>c</var>, giving us 5ln(<var>x</var>) + <var>c</var>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, to get a definite integral, we need to plug in actual values and subtract.
		As shown in the last problem, the unknown constant <var>c</var> cancels itself out because we subtract it from itself.
		This happens every time, so I&apos;ll just leave it out entirely for this problem.
		The concept is the same.
		I&apos;m going to start with the upper bound this time because of its oddity.
		The natural log of e<sup>x</sup> is by definition <var>x</var>.
		Our upper bound is e<sup>2</sup>, so running that through the antiderivative is 2*5, which is 10.
		The natural log of one is zero, so the output of our lower bound is 0*5, which is just zero.
		Ten minus zero is ten, so <strong>our final answer is just ten</strong>.
