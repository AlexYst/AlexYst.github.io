	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<h3>Daily reflection</h3>
	<h4>2018-09-05</h4>
	<p>
		The first day of a term is always a mad scramble for me.
		I make a habit of making at least one discussion post each day.
		(This post may be in either course; I don&apos;t necessarily make a post in <strong>*each*</strong> course each day, just one post between the two.)
		We&apos;re not allowed to see the course material until 00:05 in the university&apos;s time zone, which is 22:05 in my own time zone.
		That leaves me with a little less than two hours to read enough of the material in one of my new courses (of which I may know little to nothing of the subject matter) to cobble together a coherent and well-thought-out post.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some terms, I catch a break.
		This was one such term.
		The discussion assignment for the week here was to discuss our experience in installing R.
		Instead of reading up to all of the course material for the week, all I would have to do was install a little software.
		I could accomplish that in two hours.
		No sweat.
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to being in a mad rush, I put in a bit more effort in getting the thing installed than was really necessary.
		It did get installed though, and seems to function.
	</p>
	<h4>2018-09-06</h4>
	<p>
		Like I said yesterday, I aim for one post per day.
		Having made my initial post in this course yesterday, I spent today reading reading the assigned material for my other course so I could write up my initial post there.
		I did take the time to look over the reading list for this course.
		One chapter.
		I&apos;ll probably get started on that tomorrow, though I also have an errand and a work shift tomorrow, so it&apos;s unlikely I&apos;ll finish by end of day.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to download the textbook using the link in the instructions for the week, but the page at that address says there&apos;s a missing record in the database.
		Someone deleted the textbook and failed to update that link or something.
		A different copy of the textbook is linked to from the course index though, so I did get a copy onto my machine in preparation for tomorrow.
	</p>
	<h4>2018-09-07</h4>
	<p>
		I ended up making a few posts in the discussion forum with what little time I had today instead of getting started on the reading assignment.
		Maybe tomorrow then.
	</p>
	<h4>2018-09-08</h4>
	<p>
		Today, I got next to nothing done.
		I was overwhelmed with all the things I needed to accomplish, both in and out of school, and fizzled out.
		There&apos;s no excuse for that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Part of the problem is that I&apos;m focussing on too many things.
		I had that problem at the beginning of this last break too, so I put together a list of all my goals, how important they are, how urgent they are, and which ones can&apos;t be completed until after other goals have been taken care of.
		It really helped a lot.
		I decided on a few to focus on and put the rest on hold.
		But school wasn&apos;t in session then.
		I had more time.
		Now, I need to put another goal on the back burner for the time being so I have the time and energy to focus on coursework.
	</p>
	<h4>2018-09-09</h4>
	<p>
		Having set aside one of my other goals for now so I can regain focus on coursework, I had the time to read much of the assigned reading material today.
		About half the material was dedicated to justify the study of statistics.
		I&apos;m a programmer though.
		I use statistics all the time.
		You don&apos;t need to justify their usefulness to me.
		I&apos;m reminded of a mug I saw in a second-hand shop once.
		It said something to the effect of &quot;another day has gone by and I still haven&apos;t needed to use algebra&quot;.
		I saw it and thought to myself: &quot;I used algebra again earlier today. I frequently use algebra for <strong>*fun*</strong>!&quot;.
		The book is quick to point out too that you don&apos;t need to perform calculations in your head.
		You can use a computer or calculator.
		Again, this fits well into what I already do as a programmer.
		As a programmer, any calculation carried out by hand, if not done during the planning phases, is completely useless.
		By combining formulae (statistical or otherwise) and algebra, then making the computer solve for us, we get much more flexible and dynamic results.
		Understanding the logic behind a given formula is vital, but preforming the calculation by hand, at least in the field of computer science, is counterproductive.
	</p>
	<h4>2018-09-10</h4>
	<p>
		I finished the reading material and completed the learning journal exercises (below) today.
		The book says that if we experiment with R, the worst that can happen is that the computer could crash or freeze.
		I&apos;m ... hoping that the author doesn&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about.
		If running R commands can seriously take down the whole computer, that means it&apos;s incredibly poorly programmed and these problems should be fixed.
		Normally, a computer sandboxes all programs, each in its own box, so they don&apos;t accidentally trample on one another.
		It takes something pretty big to break out of one of those boxes and adversely affect the system.
		It is possible.
		I&apos;ve written bugs into my own code occasionally that have frozen my computer; usually I do it by accidentally eating up all the available memory.
		But these are things that should be long fixed in the stable versions of widely-used programs such as R.
		This isn&apos;t acceptable behaviour for released code to have.
		Only highly-experimental, unreleased code can be given a pass on that.
	</p>
	<p>
		The assignment operator in R is a bit strange.
		Most languages use an equals sign.
		In some contexts, some languages use a right-facing <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> arrow.
		R instead uses a left-facing <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> arrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		Frustratingly, the book doesn&apos;t tell how to save R sessions when running from a bare console.
		It only claims that one can save by attempting to close the console window.
		This maw work on console windows that aren&apos;t actually console windows, but on actual console windows, this doesn&apos;t work.
		Closing a console window simply prematurely terminates the program.
		I doubt we&apos;ll need to save sessions in this course, but if we do, I&apos;ll look up how to do it properly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unintuitively, it seems R allows full stops in variable names.
		I&apos;ve never seen another programming language that allows that.
	</p>
	<h4>2018-09-11</h4>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t get much done today due to having a guest over, but I did make sure to get a couple discussion posts submitted.
	</p>
	<h4>2018-09-12</h4>
	<p>
		I got my remaining discussion posts submitted and took the quiz for the week.
		Unfortunately, my time today was minimal, so I had to rush.
		I ended up scoring less on the quiz than I would like to have.
		If I manage time better next week, maybe I can do better.
	</p>
	<h3>The <code>table()</code> command</h3>
	<p>
		When using the <code>table()</code> command, the first row of numbers represents the data points in the set.
		For example, if there&apos;s a five in the data set, a five will be displayed as one of the top numbers.
		However, if multiple fives are present in the data, that&apos;s still only one thing the dataset contains, so there&apos;s only one five in the top row.
		The bottom row tells how many <strong>*instances*</strong> of the specific data exists in the set.
		For example, if there are three fives, there&apos;ll e a five in the top row and a three in the bottom row just beneath it.
	</p>
	<h3>Parameters versus statistics</h3>
	<p>
		By the definitions used for this course, a parameter is a piece of data about a specific population.
		It&apos;s not calculated based on data from a sample, but is instead the actual, factual data sought.
		In many cases, getting the exact value of a parameter is either not possible or not feasible, so parameters are guessed at based on statistics of a sample, but these guesses won&apos;t be perfect.
		On the other hand, in this course, we&apos;re using the definition that a statistic is the data calculated from a sample.
		Statistics are useful for making educated guesses about parameters, but aren&apos;t themselves the data which we seek.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given the definitions used in this course, the teacher mentioned in the problem that wants to get the average of their students&apos; test scores could use either a parameter or a statistic.
		To use a statistic, they&apos;d take a sample of the test scores, average them, then assume the statistic found was probably close to the parameter they were actually seeking.
		But what&apos;s the point of doing that?
		Statistics are used when obtaining the real parameter isn&apos;t possible or isn&apos;t feasible.
		The described teacher wants to know about the average test score not of the school or the world, but of their one class of thirty students.
		This makes their population the test scores of these specific students, which conveniently, being the grader of these students&apos; tests, is specifically the grades the teacher has the most access to.
		Likely, the grades have been entered into a computer program that can calculate the average of the population, which would be the actual parameter, in milliseconds.
		If not, averaging thirty numbers by hand using a pen and paper isn&apos;t that hard.
		Instead of using a statistic drawn from a sample of the population, it makes much more sense to just computer the parameter itself from the population itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		The company mentioned would have a difficult time finding the actual parameter describing how many people in the country know their name.
		It may or may not be possible, but it certainly wouldn&apos;t be feasible or an economically-viable option.
		They&apos;re much better off conducting a small survey to get a statistic, then making inferences about the parameter from that statistic.
		They can&apos;t get the exact answer from the statistic, but they will likely get pretty close.
