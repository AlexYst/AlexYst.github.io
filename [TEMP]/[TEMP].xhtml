		As we know, there are eight types of magical energy in this world, and as such, magic users are classified into eight categories.
		The emotional red mages, both ill-tempered and violent in times of distress, are also loving and loyal to a fault.
		They are a bit unstable at times, but they're the type who would always have your back.
		The enigmatic black mages are bringers of chaos and corruption in all that they touch.
		Their mystic arts cause mutation, and through it, evolution in all things magical.
		The enlightened magenta mages are bringers of truth.
		Through their insight, civilisation is lead in a positive direction.
		The energetic yellow mages are capable of powering anything they put their effort into.
		Our society wouldn't function without the work of these people.
		The solemn green mages are well-versed in the ways of life-giving magic.
		Though they tend to prefer creating life, they also posses the ability to take it away.
		The serene blue mages manipulate the flow of mater and energy alike.
		They give direction and purpose to anything they come in contact with.
		The purist white mages are stuck up and snotty in attitude.
		They look down on other magic users, often refusing to even acknowledge them as true mages, but they also possess the ability to separate and purify nearly anything better, faster, and more completely than anyone else.
		A lot of good separation does them though without recombination and purpose.
		And then there's us: the cyan mages.
		We specialise in works of mind.
		Astral projection.
		Advanced planning.
		Precise calculation.
		Though often labelled as emotionally cold by others, when we put our minds to it, there's little we can't accomplish.
		Of course, it pays to have help.
		Unfortunately, many of us would rather entirely delegate than work as part of the team getting things done.
		We're not all like that, though.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most mages make the choice in which magic to study based on their genetics.
		You either have yellow energy flowing through you, or white, or green ...
		You can't pick your aptitudes.
		You can try something you're ill-suited for, but you just won't get as good of results.
		Advanced mages often study secondary arts, but even then, their choice in arts is usually tied to their aptitudes.
		As a cyan mage, my kind is best with cyan magic, but we're also decent with green, blue, and white magic.
		We perform rather terribly at black, yellow, and magenta magic.
		We're completely unable to perform red magic whatsoever.
		Not that most of us would even want to.
		Red magic is a magic of emotion, directly opposite to our intellectual magic.
		Practising red magic, were we able to, would likely ... dull our ability to look at things objectively and rationally, a skill we pride ourselves in above all else.
		The red are important to our society of course, we just don't want to be them.
		We'd rather be us.

		I've learned much in my studies, but I've come across an interesting concept outside my field I'd like to look into: immortality.
		Imagine what you could learn if you had forever!
		It seems complicated though, even for me.
		If only I had more time!
		It's a chicken and egg situation.
		With time, I could study, but I need to study to get that time.
		As usual, I have a plan.
		I studied some blue magic a while back.
		I've now been studying black magic as of late, under one of its best practitioners.
		Black mages are usually the most likely to take up a second, third, or even fourth art, but in turn, they're also the most open sharing the wisdom of their arts.
		Some say it's a part of their element's desire to mutate and corrode.
		Using the mutagenic properties of black magic, I hope to adapt the magic of mine and magic of flow to send my mind back in time.
		If I can create a stable time loop for my mind but not my body, I'll have all the time I need.
		I can study as much as I need without fear of ageing.
		Once I've succeeded in securing immortality, I can hopefully break the time loop and continue on with life.
		Breaking the loop may require purifying white magic though, to undo the effects of the black magic.
		Should I fail to enlist the help of a white mage within the efforts of a single loop, things will reset again.
		I'll be trapped, looping indefinitely.
		I can try again, but I'll only have so long before previous efforts will be rendered moot and I'll have to start again.
		The white aren't so welcoming as the black, or even the blue, so I fear what might become of me.
		It's a chance I'm willing to take though.
