			<h1>Vegan diets</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	To start with, it&apos;s important to note the difference between living a vegan lifestyle (also known as &quot;veganism&quot;) and simply eating a vegan diet (also known as &quot;dietary veganism&quot;)
	Vegans avoid the use of animal-based products altogether.
	This includes food products such as meat, milk, and eggs, but also includes non-food products such as wool and leather.
	Often times, this is done for some ethical reason, such as to reduce environmental impact.
	A dietary vegan, on the other hand, simply only eats as a vegan would, typically for the perceived health benefits.
	As this week&apos;s essay topic is on our choice of diets for losing weight or other health benefits, I&apos;ll be focusing on dietary veganism and not full veganism.
</p>
<h2>Useful in losing weight</h2>
<p>
	Vegan diets tend to low in calories and fat (Rogerson, 2017).
	This makes them appear on the surface to be a simple and easy way to lose weight.
	As my dietitian explained, the most effective way to lose weight is to take in less calories.
	Exercise is of course important, but not nearly as important as simply eating less or at least eating food that has less calories and isn&apos;t going to stick around as fat.
</p>
<p>
	However, such a simple look at dietary veganism isn&apos;t really wise.
	While a vegan diet tends to be lower in calories, it&apos;s also lower in several important nutrients.
	For example, vegan diets are lower in protein, vitamin B12, calcium, iron, and iodine (Rogerson, 2017).
	Personally, when I first went vegan, I started getting headaches, which I found could be fixed with B12 supplements.
	I can say from experience that it&apos;s incredibly easy to fail to get enough B12.
	Rogerson doesn&apos;t necessarily recommend against a vegan diet though.
	They simply state that people on such a diet eat more of the foods containing these nutrients so as to make sure not to develop a deficiency (Rogerson, 2017).
	What we can take from this is that well-planned vegan diets are useful, but a haphazard vegan diet consisting of simply avoiding animal products may not be very healthy (Craig, 2009).
	It&apos;s the sort of thing you need to commit time and energy to in order to get positive results.
	It&apos;s also worth noting that in the modern world, it&apos;s often possible to get supplements.
	Finding vegan ones can be tricky when so many supplements contain gelatin (which comes from boiled animal bone goo), but good supplements do exist.
	Craig mentions fortified foods can be a great source of such nutrients as well (Craig, 2009).
	One thing Rogerson seems to point out too is that plant-based foods often sate hunger before you&apos;ve taken in as much as you need for energy (Rogerson, 2017), again recommending that vegan dieters eat more than they feel like they need to.
	This is a very valid concern if you&apos;re trying to hold your weight steady, though, this is actually beneficial.
</p>
<h2>Usefulness in digestive health</h2>
<p>
	The microbes in our digestive tract play a large role in our overall health.
	Interestingly but not all that unexpectedly, our diet has an impact on what microbes live inside us.
	Dietary vegans have reduced levels of pathobionts (Glick-Bauer &amp; Yeh, 2014); microbes that are unharmful most of the time but can cause disease under the right circumstances.
	Dietary vegans also have higher levels of protective microbe species that actually promote human health (Glick-Bauer &amp; Yeh, 2014).
	As a dietary vegan, you not only have less threat of attack from the inside, but also have a greater quantity of microbial allies within you.
</p>
<p>
	It&apos;s also worth noting that vegan diets are quite high in fibre, too (Craig, 2009).
	Fibre is indigestible material we don&apos;t get any nutrition from, but it&apos;s important for digestive health anyway.
	It promotes regular bowel movements, prevents constipation, and helps clean out the intestinal tract.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	A vegan diet, if done carefully, has many health benefits as described above.
	In theory, it should also be easier to lose weight on a vegan diet than on a non-vegan one.
	However, if done incorrectly, can have a negative impact on heath such as causing deficiencies in particular nutrients such as vitamin B12.
	As a vegan or dietary vegan, you need to watch what you eat more than your omnivorous counterparts do.
</p>
<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>
	A properly-planned vegan diet should be effective for meeting weight-loss goals without compromising health.
	For my proposed experiment, I&apos;d like to verify that.
</p>
<p>
	The subjects will be divided up into two groups: the test group and the control group.
	Both groups will be examined by a physician to determine their current health, as well as recording the weights of the participants.
	The test group will be put on a properly-planned vegan diet provided by a knowledgeable dietitian.
	The control group will be put on a properly-planned omnivorous diet provided by a knowledgeable dietitian.
	Every month, both groups will go in for an examination to determine any changes - positive or negative - to the participants health, as well as to record the participants&apos; new weights.
	At the end of a three-month period, both groups results will be compared to see if there is a health difference between the groups and between the participants and their past selves, as well as to see how much weight each group lost.
</p>
<p>
	My hypothesis is that the vegan diet group should loose weight with no adverse effects.
	They&apos;ll likely lose weight a little faster, and other aspects of their health will likely improve as well.
	The test group will likely see improved health as well, due to their reduced weight, but I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll see as much of an improvement in health as the test group.
	Other possibilities though would be that we may see less health improvement in the test group than the control group, or may even see a negative change in health (though the research indicates that a negative impact to health is unlikely).
	The test group may actually lose weight slower than the control group, though this doesn&apos;t seem likely to me.
