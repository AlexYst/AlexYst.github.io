			<h1>Abstracts</h1>

	The abstract is the first thing people see when they look at your paper.
	Often times, it&apos;s the only part of your paper they read.
	People read the abstract to find out if reading your paper will even be beneficial to them.
	For example, your paper may be on a different topic than the one they&apos;re wanting to read about.
	For that reason, an abstract should be very clear in conveying what your paper will be about.
	Making sure to go over the methodology (briefly) is also vital.
	You need to make it clear what your methods were so readers will know your methodology was valid.
	Why read a paper based on invalid methodology?
	The conclusions found would be next to meaningless, so it would be a waste of the reader&apos;s time.
	My next point is one many people disagree with.
	People want to have their papers read, after all, for various reasons.
	For some, this validates their effort in having written it.
	For others, it makes them more money because they put their paper behind a pay wall and show only the abstract gratis to lure in customers.
	However, I believe an abstract should convey what is expected readers would want to know from your paper.
	Time is valuable, and as a busy person, I don&apos;t want to be reading through entire papers to find very basic information that should be given up front.
	If I&apos;m doing research for something important, fine, I&apos;ll read your paper to find exactly what you have to say.
	However, if I&apos;m just looking something up really quickly for my own personal use, I&apos;m not interested.
	An abstract shouldn&apos;t be overly long, but it should still convey the vital facts uncovered, even if that results in less people reading the rest of the paper.
	As both a reader and as a writer, I strongly believe the purpose of the paper should be to be useful to the reader, not to accumulate a read count.
