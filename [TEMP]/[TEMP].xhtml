			<h1>Gender differences in illness</h1>

<section id="Unit2">
	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
	<p>
		When I read &quot;Should I buy a new payroll program from vendor X or vendor Y?&quot;, the first thing that popped into my head was &quot;It depends. Which one is open source?&quot;.
		Seriously, I don&apos;t trust software from anyone if the source code is hidden from the public.
		I don&apos;t mind paying, but if the source code is hidden, you don&apos;t know what malicious things the software may or may not be doing behind your back.
	</p>
	<p>
		The section on types of growth rates was all review for me.
		I don&apos;t recall where I learned about algorithm growth rates, but it&apos;s something I&apos;ve known about for a while.
		Some algorithms remain linear in their resource consumption as the input size grows, but others grow exponentially, leading resource usage to get out of control for larger inputs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hadn&apos;t considered data distribution as a factor.
		It makes a difference though when trying to understand the average case, as well as consider how likely the best and worst cases are.
		I also hadn&apos;t considered comparing the switching of algorithms to the switching of computers.
		Making that comparison really shows you whether it&apos;s the algorithm or the computer&apos;s speed that&apos;s holding you back.
	</p>
	<p>
		The discussion assignment told us to use big-Oh notation, so I read the textbook up to that point, then made my initial post.
		I often don&apos;t have time to read the entire assigned material in one or two days, but I need to get my initial discussion post in by them to keep my coursework on schedule.
		Reading further though, it looks like there&apos;s also a big-Omega and big-Theta notation, both of which could apply to the discussion assignment well.
		In particular, big-Theta would be the most appropriate.
		However, we were asked to use big-Oh, so I guess my submission is what we were asked to have it be.
	</p>
	<p>
		I mean, aside from the part that I was dead wrong about problem 0.
		My answer was that there was no solution.
		I learned from other students that I&apos;d done it wrong though, and that there is in fact a valid solution to the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the simplification methods for cost growth formulas make use of basic mathematical properties.
		Others though use engineers&apos; logic of &quot;well, it&apos;s close enough&quot;
		Normally, I&apos;d disagree and say that &quot;close enough&quot; isn&apos;t actually close enough.
		However, cost growth formulas are themselves an estimation.
		They&apos;re not used in anything you&apos;d actually code into the machine.
		Instead, they help you determine which algorithms are most likely not to be worth the time it takes to implement them.
		In such cases, &quot;close enough&quot; often is really close enough.
	</p>
	<p>
		The book discusses not only time constraints, but disk space constraints and memory constraints.
		I faced such constraints when working on a Web spider I built.
		I&apos;ve had to shelve the spider due to time constraints keeping me from continuing development.
		While I was working on and testing it though, I found such disk/memory constraints to be problematic.
		I don&apos;t recall whether it was disk space or <abbr title="random-access memory">RAM</abbr>, but I found I was using too much.
		I had to drastically cut what the spider kept track of.
		Instead of storing every <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> it encountered, I had to change it to only temporarily store <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s of the pages it found on a given site that pointed to other pages on that same site.
		For external links, everything but the port, domain, and scheme was just dropped.
		And once it finished crawling a site, I had to have it drop all full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s within the site, keeping only one reference to the home page of the site.
		It made the indexing less complete than I wanted it to be, but the spider was still pretty good at discovering new websites.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lookup tables are a good thing to learn about, though this was all review for me.
		I actually use lookup tables in my code all the time to make my code run faster.
		It does cost more <abbr title="random-access memory">RAM</abbr>, and I&apos;m aware of that, but when I use them, I use them because I feel the trade-off is not only worth it, but sometimes even necessary.
		For example, there&apos;s a game I play when I need to de-stress called Minetest.
		It&apos;s got a great <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> to build content against.
		One of my main plugins operates on certain types of in-game items.
		So when the game starts, it runs through the list of items and creates a look-up table of the ones with qualities it cares about.
		Out of probably a couple hundred items, it only needs data on maybe about three dozen.
		It then checks that look-up table when certain events occur, and if the item triggering the event isn&apos;t in the table, the code knows it can safely ignore the event instead of looking up the information on the item and recomputing which events relating to that item are even relevant.
		And within each table element is a subtable recording which events related to that item matter, so even when encountering an item with known-relevant events, the relevant events don&apos;t need to be recalculated.
		A player can trigger an event that needs to be checked for importance a few times per second, so especially in multiplayer mode, this time-saving is vital.
	</p>
	<p>
		The book makes a good point about not wasting time trying to optimise code blindly.
		Some spots will need the optimisation much more drastically.
		Once the worst of it&apos;s fixed, there comes a point when the host of human labour exceeds the savings on time and computer labour.
		The cost of conditionals is something I hadn&apos;t given much thought to as well.
		If the savings of skipping some part of the work doesn&apos;t outweigh the cost of the conditional, attempting to skip pointless work will actually lead to more work for the machine.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the discussion assignment, I was reminded of the importance of graphing.
		I failed to find the solution to part zero, and I would&apos;ve found it easily had I pulled out a graphing calculator.
		A few students did in fact use graphing calculators, and posted their graphs as a part of their discussion write-up.
		It seems though that I&apos;m the only student that figure out that the solution to part one was O(n!).
		Or am I the only one to <strong>*mistakenly think*</strong> that the answer is O(n!)?
		I got the first answer wrong, so it certainly wouldn&apos;t be out of the realm of probability that I got the second answer wrong too.
		It&apos;d be nice if a definitive answer to the problem was provided after week&apos;s end, though I doubt it will be.
