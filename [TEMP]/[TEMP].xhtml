			<h1>Senses</h1>

<h2>Internal senses</h2>
<p>
	We&apos;ve been asked whether we think we might have senses that don&apos;t sense the environment, but instead, sense information from within ourselves.
	Examples offered included sensing one&apos;s own hunger, sensing a need for air when holding one&apos;s breath for too long, and sensing a need for belonging.
	I have mixed thoughts on this.
</p>
<p>
	To start with, let&apos;s address the need for belonging, as it&apos;s the most clear to define.
	The need for belonging takes place entirely in the mind.
	It&apos;s a very valid and very real need, and the brain causes lack of meeting that need to cause physical harm to itself and the rest of the body, but in the end, that need is still very much only in the mind.
	If the mind just decided not to need to belong, the individual would not have that need.
	(To be clear, I&apos;m not saying we can just decide not to need to belong, nor am I saying that the brain is even capable of shutting off this need.
	However, if the brain were altered or replaced in such a way where this need were not present, no other part of the body would show issue to the individual not feeling like they belong.)
	What this tells us is that when this need is met or not met, it&apos;s not something that can be detected by the senses.
	Instead, senses are used to determine the situation, then the brain determines if the need was met based on its model of how it interprets the state of the world.
	&quot;Sensing&quot; that you do or don&apos;t belong isn&apos;t actually a sense, but rather, an application by the brain of data modelled after other data gathered from actual senses.
	In other words, the &quot;sense&quot; of belonging isn&apos;t a sense, but a perception.
</p>
<p>
	As for hunger and the need for air, these aren&apos;t senses in and of themselves, obviously, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s what&apos;s being asked, either.
	They&apos;re responses to very real senses.
	They&apos;re a way of making the conscious mind aware of a need unmet so it can do something about it.
	In the case of breathing, the instincts will force their way eventually, though first give the conscious mind a chance to take care of the problem.
	As for hunger, the conscious mind pretty much <strong>*has*</strong> to be used to meet the need, so the only course of action is to get increasingly vocal about the need in the form of hunger.
</p>
<h2>More than five external senses</h2>
<p>
	We are asked if there are more than just the five commonly-spoken-about external senses - sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell - and why if there are more, why the dominant scientific community says there are only these five.
	That&apos;s a bit of a trick question.
	First, of <strong>*course*</strong> there are more senses than that.
	Just off the top of my head, we have a sense of temperature and sense of balance, but there are about a couple dozen senses, not just five.
	As for why the dominant scientific community would say that there are only five: they <strong>*don&apos;t*</strong>.
	Claiming they do is an outright lie.
	Rather, it&apos;s not the scientific community that makes this only-five-senses claim, but the layperson community.
	Sadly, this even extends into the school system.
	There are quite a few things you learn in school that are outright wrong and completely unbacked by science.
	For example, you typically learn in school that the primary colours are red, yellow, and blue.
	This is scientifically and verily false.
	The scientific consensus is that the primary colours are red, <strong>*green*</strong>, and blue.
	Yellow is a secondary colour that&apos;s - believe it or not - composed of a mix of red and green.
</p>
<h2>Definitions limit us</h2>
<p>
	Language is a construct that allows us to communicate.
	However, it&apos;s also a lens through with we view the world.
	When we lack words for concepts, we tend not to think about those concepts so much.
	When we have definitions, the definitions form categories into which we try to box things.
</p>
<p>
	We&apos;ve been asked whether the definition of the word &quot;sense&quot; needs to be expanded.
	I don&apos;t think the problem is the definition.
	Not the true definition, anyway.
	The problem is that people aren&apos;t using language correctly.
	They get taught a false definition, and that false definition shapes their views just the same as a real definition would.
	After all, definitions are arbitrary.
	There&apos;s no real deference in effect between a true definition and a false one.
	Rather than redefining the word though, we just need to teach the scientifically-accurate concepts rather than the simpler-to-grasp concepts that tend to be covered in primary schools.
</p>
<h2>Operant conditioning applied to the learning of reading skills</h2>
<p>
	We&apos;re asked what the role of operant conditioning is in the learning of reading skills.
	Honestly, it depends on the learner.
	My siblings and I all learned to read long before we entered the school system.
	Our parents hadn&apos;t even intended to teach us yet.
	Instead, we watched people around us and figured out that all those little symbols all over many things had some sort of meaning people were understanding from them.
	We were curious and wanted to know what was going on.
	We asked questions, and our parents answered them.
	Operant conditioning occurs when either a desired behaviour is rewarded or an undesired behaviour is punished (OpenStax College, 2017).
	Unless the reward/punishment for asking questions is correct answers to the best of the question recipient&apos;s ability, no operant conditioning was used on us.
</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, some students don&apos;t learn to read until they&apos;re in school, and have to learn there.
	Typical school-based operant conditioning is applied to these students, praising them when they get it right and contacting parents about the problem if they don&apos;t get it right within what is considered a reasonable time frame.
</p>
<p>
	Reading is one of those things that changes the way your brain works.
	You intake visual data, and you process it whether you want to or not.
	You check your memory for the sequence of recognised characters and assign a meaning to it.
	You can&apos;t look at text and <strong>*not*</strong> read it.
	I mean, you might just stare at a single word, reading only that word instead of scanning an entire printed surface, but as suggested, it dose become automatic.
	I wouldn&apos;t call the process operant conditioning though.
	The brain is trying to make sense of the characters written on the visible surface.
	It does this repeatedly as you view those same sorts of characters on various surfaces and in various places.
	You could say that the brain&apos;s reward is that it then understands the data left by whoever wrote it.
	You could say that the confusion of not knowing what it means is the punishment.
	However, these are all internal.
	I don&apos;t think it qualifies as operant conditioning unless there is an external reward and/or punishment system.
	For example, if someone were to praise a child every time they read something correctly, that would be operant learning, but if the task is its own intrinsic reward, I&apos;d argue that it&apos;s not operant conditioning at all.
</p>
<p>
	As for other skills, I&apos;d say that yes, they do often follow that same sort of path.
	That is to say, some people learn because they want to with no operant conditioning applied, while others learn because they&apos;re directed to and are subjected to typical positive and negative conditioning.
	In fact, some people learn skills <strong>*despite*</strong> operant conditioning directing them not to.
	Repeated use of skills though, whether operant conditioning is the reason for the repeated skill use, does tend to ingrain that skill in you, often to the point that you use the skill without even (consciously) thinking about it.
