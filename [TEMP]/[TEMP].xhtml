	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/01bool.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 01bool.pdf</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/02voc.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 02voc.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I suppose my main reaction is thinking that this is easier than I feared it&apos;d be.
		At least for this week, the material was pretty straightforward.
		It might be the case that search engines aren&apos;t as complex as I once thought they were.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The term has just begun, and no assignments have yet been submitted, so there isn&apos;t any feedback yet to report.
		As for interactions, the discussion board assignments have some limited interaction.
		From other students, I read mostly posts about positional indexes to supliment the research I&apos;d done for my own post about bi-word indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		My feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t really worth describing, as they don&apos;t really change much since the school administration started hassling me in various ways.
		Suffice to say though, my feelings and attitudes are quite a hindrance to getting my work done each week, but I always pull through in the end.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned how some types of indexing are performed as well as how indexes are searched.
		In particular, we focused on bi-word indexes and positional indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		One use for searching that I hadn&apos;t considered before is spell-checking.
		I guess I&apos;d never thought about how a spell-checker works.
		It&apos;s surprising to read that it&apos;s done using a searching algorithm, though in retrospect, I guess it shouldn&apos;t be <strong>*that*</strong> surprising.
		As for wondering, I wonder why an index would be referred to as an &quot;inverted index&quot;.
		An index, as defined by the reading material, is an inverted file.
		When you invert something and invert it again, you get back the original.
		However, an &quot;inverted index&quot; isn&apos;t the original file, but actually the same thing as a regular, uninverted index.
		It&apos;s a confusing misnomer, and I wonder why people come up with such counter-intuitive and outright incorrect terms to describe things.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		The only challenge this week was working up the motivation to get to work.
		Doing that has been difficult the past couple years due to garbage constantly thrown at me by the school staff.
		The professors, of course, are guilt-free of this, but the administration&apos;s behaviour has plunged me into a deep depression that makes it difficult to get anything done at all.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning not only how types of indexes are structured - which would be vital for constructing software that&apos;d generate an index for me - but also the strengths and weaknesses of different index formats.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t learn well in the sort of environment this school provides.
		I can get stuff done, but it&apos;s very laborious.
		I find I still have my former love of learning when I&apos;m studying things on my own, but as soon as I try to get going on coursework, I lose the will to actually learn anything.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m not sure.
		I can&apos;t help but feel that searching algorithms could come in very handy at some point, I&apos;m just not sure what I&apos;d use them for just yet.
		One thing that you have to keep in mind is that I&apos;m not a computer person by trade, but only by hobby.
		General business purposes don&apos;t really apply to me like they would students planning to go into database administration or something.
	</p>
	<p>
		I suppose one thing I might be able to use this for is for building a search system for my own website.
		It&apos;s a very small website, but it includes a public journal that&apos;s had daily entries added by me for the past several years.
		It might be nice to add a pre-generated list of pages relevant to various specific topics, and perhaps an auto-generated index could help build those lists.
		(As my site is entirely pre-compiled and static from the perspective of the reader, an actual search feature isn&apos;t possible.)

<section id="Unit2">
	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/03dict.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 03dict.pdf</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/04const.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 04const.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on index types and the programming assignment, which was barely an assignment at all.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		When I saw that the instructions for this week&apos;s assignment wanted us to use &quot;the current version of Python 2&quot;, I wondered how tricky that&apos;d be to get running.
		I thought for sure that Debian 10, my operating system, defaulted to Python 3.*, and I know that Python 3 isn&apos;t compatible with all Python 2 scripts.
		I knew 2.* and 3.* are both available in the Debian repository but I wasn&apos;t sure how to configure Debian to use 2.* if I installed it.
		Thankfully, running <code>python --version</code> showed me that I have 2.7.16 installed; that must be Debian&apos;s preinstalled default then.
		That was easy.
		Out of curiosity though, I checked online to see if this was indeed the current version.
		As it turns out, support for Python 2.7 is an end-of-life release for the 2.* series, and support for it was dropped on 2020-01-01.
		That means there <strong>*is no*</strong> &quot;current&quot; version of Python 2 any more.
		It&apos;s interesting that it&apos;s still the default in Debian then.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note, the assignment instructions also claims that while Windows uses forward slashes as directory separators in file paths while Linux uses backslashes.
		This is completely and absolutely false.
		Linux (and in fact most operating systems) uses <strong>*forward slashes*</strong> for path separators.
		Windows is the odd one out that uses backslashes.
		To try to be a bit compatible with normal file paths though, Windows does allow forward slashes to be used instead of backslashes though.
		So to put it simply, Windows uses both forward slashes and backslashes, while everyone else including Linux uses only forward slashes.
		I hope this gets fixed in the assignment instructions for next term.
		On the topic of incorrect information that should be updated, the assignment instructions also claim that the parts of the code shown in the instructions are in bold.
		The entire script is shown in italics, but nothing is in bold.
		I wouldn&apos;t necessarily say that the use of a bold type face should be used as it&apos;s easy to find the parts that need to be edited, but if a bold type face isn&apos;t used, the part claiming that it is should be removed.
		Hopefully, that too will be updated for next term.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the sounds of the instructions, the assignment was to modify the variable containing the path to the corpus of documents we were instructed to download, then add statistics reporting.
		The actual parsing of the files and the generation of the database files was already programmed for us, with the exception of a file that we&apos;d be programming the generation of in a later assignment.
		After verifying my Python setup and changing the one variable though, I just ran the script.
		I figured that if there were any errors in the code or my setup that interfered, I&apos;d catch and correct them before having put in any actual effort in developing anything.
		Much to my surprise though, the script output exactly the statistics we were instructed to have it report.
		Just like that.
		No effort on my part.
		At all.
		So ... I don&apos;t get the assignment.
		Was the assignment just to change one variable to reflect were we&apos;d extracted the files on our local machines?
		I&apos;m not complaining.
		It later turned out to be a long week for me and I had two nights where I didn&apos;t even go to bed and instead had to stay awake for about forty hours straight.
		An easy assignment that doesn&apos;t require me to spend another night sleepless was definitely welcome.
		It did seem rather underwhelming and pointless though.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The only feedback so far is for the learning journal, and thankfully, the professor this term seems fine with my format.
		I never know how I&apos;ll do on these open-ended learning journal assignments on the first week, as different professors have different preferences.
		I&apos;ve had professors mark me down for writing too much, then when I write less the next week to correct my mistake, they write me down for writing too little ...
		And some don&apos;t like the questions separated into sections with the questions used as headings and want it in free-form paragraph style, while some want the separate headings to make it easier to see that all the questions were answered ...
		Getting it right on the first week makes it easier to write my learning journal assignments on later weeks, as I can pretty much just do the same thing again.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		As mentioned <a href="#Unit1">last week</a>, my feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t great, but that&apos;s to be expected given my situation.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned more concretely how indexes are formatted.
		It&apos;s one thing to read it in a book, but it&apos;s another to actually see the output files generated by an indexer.
		Even though we didn&apos;t actually build the indexer - it was just given to us - we were still able to see the original files and the files built by the indexer.
		Were were also free to run the indexer on files of our own to experiment.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		It baffles me that blocked sort-based indexing uses document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s instead of file names and term strings.
		It seems rather arbitrary not to use the identifiers inherent to the things at hand and instead assign numeric identifiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s also surprising that the indexer we&apos;re working with assigns <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s starting from one instead of zero.
		It&apos;s counter-intuitive.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my main challenge.
		The work isn&apos;t difficult.
		Getting myself to even get started on the work, however, really is.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning the strengths and weaknesses of index formats.
		I don&apos;t think a blocked sort-based index would be right for me, were I to build an automated indexer for my website.
		I&apos;d want to be able to read the index by hand to see what had been indexed, and the document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s being used instead of file names and term strings would make it incredibly hard to do that.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t do well here; not that there&apos;s anything I can do about it.
		I muddle through, but it&apos;s very stressful and I end up having to spend sleepless nights to get anything done.
		Twice this week, I had to pull all-nighters and stay awake for about forty hours at a time.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m still not sure.
		I&apos;m still not sure I&apos;d ever need to build an index of anything.
		There&apos;s a chance I might build one for my website, which I brought up the possibility of last week, though I don&apos;t see me getting to that any time soon.
		I have so many sub-projects for my website that I just haven&apos;t gotten to, and an indexer would be pretty low on the list, not to mention that I&apos;ve got non-website stuff going on as well.
		The thing you have to understand is that I&apos;ll probably never even apply for a computer-related job.
		I program as a hobby, not for employment.
	</p>
	<p>
		These sorts of questions are sort of odd; I&apos;m not sure why assignments ask them of students.
		The required courses for a degree are so varied that the topics of every course a student takes can&apos;t apply to every student.
		To put that another way, every student is asked how the material applies to them, but in most cases, the student took the course because it&apos;s required for the degree and not because the material will ever be relevant to them.
		For example, required courses at this school include this course on information retrieval, a course on Web development, a course on Linux, a course on Windows, a course on <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> graphics, a course on Java, and a course on Python, among others.
		What profession makes use of all of that?
		Don&apos;t get me wrong, the material of this course is interesting, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll use it in a meaningful context.
		I know for a fact that the material from the Windows course isn&apos;t something I&apos;ll ever use.

	<h2>Unit 3</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/05comp.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 05comp.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on estimating index vocabulary sizes.
		I also graded submissions that were submitted by students last week.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been rather behind, and I&apos;m trying to catch up.
		Having another slow week like this should have helped.
		I&apos;ve been doing a bit better emotionally lately, so I shouldn&apos;t fall so far behind again, but catching up from before is a challenge, especially because of my shifted schedule at work.
		I no longer have the days off that I need most.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also noticed the output again from the script.
		It clearly has minute-level precision in the output of what time it starts and stops.
		I&apos;d mentioned it having second-level precision in my own submission.
		That&apos;s embarrassing.
		It makes me look like an absolute imbecile that can&apos;t understand basic time displays.
		I was running on so little sleep that week, which is likely why I made such an obvious error, but the students grading it aren&apos;t going to know that.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The only feedback so far is for the learning journal.
		You mention your child overthinking the work and having to stay up for two days straight, similar to how I&apos;ve been staying up for two days straight.
		I&apos;m sorry to hear that, but also envious that that was the only issue.
		For me, even working up the motivation has been problematic.
		I know the work is fairly simple, and I still can&apos;t get myself to do it.
		I tell myself I have to do it before I can go to bed, then I can&apos;t get myself to even look at it, then have to stay up increasingly late.
		I&apos;ve been learning some stuff about emotional management though recently.
		I actually talked myself into going off on a couple of my workmates that are rather disrespectful, which is something I just don&apos;t do.
		I just sit there and deal with mistreatment.
		At the end of this week, I actually had a couple days were I was feeling outright chipper.
		Working up motivation is still a problem, but it should be less of an issue as I better tackle the unrelated disrespect issue that has been likewise weighing me down.
		I&apos;ll have more energy to put toward pushing myself to get the coursework done earlier in the week.
	</p>
	<p>
		You mention potentially needing to do some serious big data analysis and needing an index to aid in that.
		That does sound like a great time to use index-building/-managing skills, though the chances I&apos;ll be doing anything computer-related for employment is incredibly small.
		I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;d have such a big data set for as far as personal work, as that seems like something a large, evil company might want to use for targeted marketing or something.
		(I&apos;m not suggesting that large companies are always evil, but targeted marketing using large data sets usually involves invading people&apos;s privacy, so that use of large data sets is only done by companies that at least have an evil side to them.)
	</p>
	<p>
		As for undergrad being like extended high school ...
		I&apos;d rather go back to high school.
		At least my high school didn&apos;t censor me or write me off.
		This school is doing both, and the censorship is the reason I can&apos;t work up the motivation to get anything school-related done in a timely manner.
		Before the censorship, I used to get the bulk of my work done in the first couple days, then spend the rest of the time refining and expanding on it.
		I used to be a fabulous student.
		Now I&apos;m a rather shoddy one that can barely meet deadlines.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the value of a computer science degree getting you past human resources, I fully agree.
		Having a degree in anything makes a huge difference, and that&apos;s the only reason I haven&apos;t given up fully yet.
		If not for that, I&apos;d dropped out by now.
		I don&apos;t know what to get a job in, so I don&apos;t know what sort of degree to pursue.
		Just having a degree at all, even if it&apos;s not a relevant degree, will get you into a lot of jobs though.
		While the chances that I&apos;d find a computer-related job that didn&apos;t force me to violate my principles and make me hate myself (all software I write has freely-licensed source code that&apos;s available for everyone to read, use, and modify, and nothing will ever get me to change that) is slim, out of not knowing what degree to get, I&apos;m working on a computer science degree, figuring at least some of it will apply to my personal life.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		As mentioned in <a href="#Unit1">Unit 1</a>, my feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t great, but that&apos;s to be expected given my situation.
		Things are unexpectedly improving a bit though, so we&apos;ll see how that goes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned about estimations of index vocabulary size, as well as how widely an estimation can vary if it&apos;s not done with proper values.
		You really need to take the time to get your estimation right, or it won&apos;t be.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		It surprised me how widely estimations based on Heap&apos;s law can be.
		It looks like such a simple equation, but every variable is something you have to measure or estimate, and those estimations can cause terrible results if done poorly.
		An estimation can be up to nearly 77 times as large as it should, or a bit over one seventy-seventh the size of the real value.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my only real challenge so far.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning how to apply Heap&apos;s law to estimate vocabulary size before running an indexer, so as to know about how much space the index might take up.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		This same question is asked week after week, but there&apos;s not new things learned about my learning style so often.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m still not sure.
		I&apos;m almost certainly not going to get a computer-related job, let alone a job that&apos;d specifically be helped along by building and/or managing an index.
		It&apos;s interesting stuff for sure, but not particularly applicable to my life.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Unit4">
	<h2>Unit 4</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/06vect.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 06vect.pdf</a>, <a href="https://en.youscribe.com/BookReader/Index/521048/?documentId=492171">Term Vector Fast Track Tutorial</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">Cosine similarity - Wikipedia</a>.
		I also participated in the discussion assignment on inverse document frequencies and parametric and zone indexes, then completed the programming assignment for the week.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I cleaned up the starter code this week before I worked with it.
		Namely, I removed all carriage returns (as they&apos;re redundant) and converted all space-based indention to use tabs instead (the tab character is literally a character dedicated to indentation; semantically, tabs are the <strong>*only*</strong> proper way to indent anything unless you&apos;re using some of the fancy, multi-byte indentation characters in Unicode, which are overkill for code and probably not supported by Python anyway).
		Last week, we only changed one line of the script, so the white space mess didn&apos;t really affect me.
		This time though, we did more-extensive editing, and I needed a clean starting point so my own clean changes would be consistent.
		I didn&apos;t even <strong>*think*</strong> to test the cleaned code before starting my own modifications to it for the week.
		I started getting an odd issue when I tried to test my features though: the number of tokens found was always equal to the number of documents processed.
		One token per document?
		That couldn&apos;t be right.
		Had I broken something so documents weren&apos;t getting tokenised, and whole-document tokens were being used?
		After giving up on trying to find the error by eye, I reverted all my changes, only to find the error persisted.
		It was the cleaning process that had broken the code.
		I downloaded a new copy and tried cleaning that again, and found the error was related to the indentation, not the carriage returns.
		Looking through the code, I found that there exists a single tab character in the entire original file.
		I remember that Python considers tabs to be equivalent to eight spaces, but the original code does most of its indentation by four spaces.
		For some reason, this one single line used a tab and four spaces to indent by three levels, which is completely inconsistent with the rest of the code.
		So that one tab actually needed to be converted into two tabs.
		An easy fix, but only after wasting half an hour or so trying to find what even needed to be fixed.
		It was only the token counter that was affected too, not the actual tokenisation process.
		And speaking of indentation inconsistencies, some lines actually indent using two spaces for some reason, so the singular tab character isn&apos;t the only indentation inconsistency in the file, it&apos;s just the only one that I missed when I cleaned the code.
		Whoever wrote this code needs to work on their consistency.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, long story short, using indentation as a form of syntax was a terrible design choice on the part of the Python developers.
		While these inconsistencies shouldn&apos;t show up in decently-written code, it doesn&apos;t mean that they should cause errors in how the code is executed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other thing I quickly found bothersome was that the index files were contaminating the input of the indexer next time it got run.
		I noticed that last week, too, but again, I didn&apos;t need to run the indexer a bunch of times so I ignored it.
		Honestly, the proper solution would be to put the index files outside the directory of files getting indexed, but in order to keep clean lines between what I added and what was a part of the original script, I had been putting comments around my code to show what I&apos;d added.
		I couldn&apos;t do that for partial line changes, so I just had the indexer delete the index files after checking to see if they were present before checking the directory for files to index.
		That worked as expected, and made subsequent runs of the indexer provide proper output instead of contaminated output.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got the stemmer use, stop words, and display of the new statistics implemented with minimal difficulty.
		I found one mistake I made particularly hilarious though.
		On assignments such as these, I tend to write my comments on a section of code just before I write the code, so I can more-carefully document what I&apos;m thinking before I lose some of those thoughts, which always happens after I have things implemented.
		I wrote in my comments that the stemmer we were given wants to know where the last character in the string is, so we should pass the length of the string minus one.
		I then immediately proceeded to forget to subtract one in the actual code, so the script halted with a very obvious error message.
		In my defence, it was a rush job, as I&apos;d been working on the assignment on most of my ten-minute breaks at work, so I didn&apos;t have much time to get into code what I was thinking, but still, kind of funny.
		That&apos;s not to say that I didn&apos;t spend a few hours at home working on this too, but I did what I could at work as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moving on to the generation of the data that&apos;d be stored in the third file, I was kind of at a loss at first.
		I read the script, and quite confusingly to me, it pours all the tokens from all the files into one big pile before processing a single one of them.
		It doesn&apos;t process them one at a time, which means that when each token is processed, the script has lost track of what file the token even came from.
		How in Squiddy&apos;s name was I supposed to add stuff to the script there that&apos;d link the term to the document?
		I&apos;d either have to make some heavy modifications to the existing code - and I&apos;d been trying to avoid deleting even a single line of the original code, save for the line telling the script what directory to use, so such heavy rewrites would be far less than ideal - or I&apos;d need to program a second pass over the documents, which seemed rather inefficient.
		I started looking over the index files though, and started to realise it really didn&apos;t matter.
		Even if the script knew what file the term was from, it wouldn&apos;t have the proper term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s yet.
		The terms need to all be found so they can be sorted.
		The <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s can then be assigned in a sane, sequential order.
		A second pass over the documents was pretty much mandatory anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		The assigned <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s though ... They&apos;re indexed from one.
		Zero is just skipped.
		I&apos;ve been trying to ignore it, and I&apos;ve been telling myself that it&apos;s fine because I didn&apos;t decide on the format of the generated files.
		However, I now had to completely write the part of the code that&apos;d generate the third file, and the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s would be used there.
		I had to fix the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s.
		Thankfully, the fix was pretty easy.
		And in fact, it looks like indexing from one might be a bug in the code.
		Two variables are used for keeping track of the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s that need to be assigned next.
		They&apos;re initialised to zero.
		However, instead of incrementing the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s each time after an <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is assigned, the value is incremented <strong>*before*</strong> the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is assigned, including before the first time an <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is assigned.
		That results in the initial value of the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> variables simply getting skipped over.
		At first, I figured I&apos;d just add another comment-delimited segment that changed the variables to start at negative one.
		It&apos;d have a double assignment before use, but it&apos;d function correctly.
		In the end though, I decided that rearranging lines didn&apos;t count as deletion, and just fixed the actual bug by reversing the two consecutive lines of code that appeared in the wrong order, in both places.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of the index format, I noticed that the two files the provided code outputs uses a comma-separated value format.
		However, as some terms end in a comma and we&apos;re not doing anything about that just yet, commas meant as part of the values are ending up in the file in addition to the ones used for data structure.
		The commas aren&apos;t even escaped in any way, which again, bothers me.
		It&apos;s not my problem, as I&apos;m not supposed to decide on the format of these files, but it made me think I&apos;d want to have my third file, which I <strong>*do*</strong> design, use a tab-separated structure instead.
		That way, the commas in the stored data wouldn&apos;t matter.
		I later realised that that was a moot point though, as the terms don&apos;t even appear in the file I&apos;d be designing.
		Instead, the term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s would be used.
		I ended up proceeding with the tab-separated structure anyway though, as it&apos;s easier to look through in a text editor if you&apos;re trying to read the output.
	</p>
	<p>
		One last thing was kind of bothering me even before I started working on the actual code that&apos;d perform the second pass.
		I was only to have the code generate a single extra file, which would have a line for each document/term pair.
		However, one stat I was to find and store was the document frequency: the number of documents associated with the term.
		That stat is specific to the term, not the document/term pair, so it&apos;d be the same for each document/term pair that has that same term.
		For example, if the term &quot;potato&quot; was found in twenty documents, the &quot;20&quot; statistic would be stored in the file twenty times.
		It&apos;d make much more sense to generate a fourth file with these sorts of per-term statistics that didn&apos;t vary between documents that include the term.
	</p>
	<p>
		After writing up most of my final solution, I went back to thinking this could have been done in a single pass after all.
		I was using terms and document names themselves all throughout my internal data structures and only converting into IDs just before writing the data to the file.
		If the code given to us wasn&apos;t dumping all the tokens from all the files into one big pile - or if I was up to modifying that part of the code - this could have totally been done in a single pass.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		No one commented on my inability to tell seconds from minutes - or hardly commented at all, really - on my submission from two weeks ago.
		I&apos;ll take that.
		Maybe no one noticed what an idiot I was when I submitted that.
		There wasn&apos;t much to say about the &quot;project&quot; either, if it could even be called that, so it makes sense there wouldn&apos;t really be any other feedback on it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for my learning journal submission from last week ...
		You say not to let little things get in the way, but censorship is no little thing.
		It requires me not to be open, which is contrary to every fibre of my being.
		It hurts.
		Badly.
		Every minute I spend on coursework is a minute I&apos;m not allowed to talk about, and that makes it very difficult to work up the motivation to work on coursework at all.
		As for what censorship, the school issued a takedown request directed at me and my website telling me to take down my discussion of my studies from my public journal, and made sure to include threats in it.
		They said if I didn&apos;t remove what I&apos;d written about my journey here at the university, I&apos;d be expelled and/or retroactively failed from all my courses.
		They couldn&apos;t even have the decency to try asking nicely before resorting to threats.
		It caused me so much emotional distress that I was incapacitated for a few days, mostly just laying in bed with a killer headache.
		I recovered from the headache, but the stress and the lethargy won&apos;t go away until the censorship does, and that&apos;s only going to happen once I&apos;ve graduated and left this school.
		This place has me down so much I literally wrote some code that displays a countdown for me telling me how many days I have left stuck here just to help me see the light at the end of the tunnel.
		Had the school asked nicely, I would have taken it all down without complaint and without any mental or emotional damage to myself.
		But no.
		The school would rather throw their weight around whether they need to in order to get their way or not.
		And the school has a pretty heavy influence on the students, so throwing that sort of weight around is going to cause some equally-heavy damage.
		
		I get that the school and the staff here are underfunded.
		That&apos;s an excuse for much of what goes on here, including the lack of tech support and the getting written off by staff members, but that will never be an excuse for something as vile as censorship.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be clear, my professors have always been fantastic at best or inattentive at worst.
		They have <strong>*never*</strong> pulled any of the garbage that&apos;s been draining the life out of me for the past couple years.
		And yeah, it&apos;s been a couple years now, meaning that the recent pandemic has nothing to do with the problem.
		My records indicate that the takedown letter was received and acted upon on 2017-11-01, so it&apos;s been a while of living this way.
		I do appreciate all that you do for us to help us attend an affordable school.
		I wouldn&apos;t be able to pay for schooling if it weren&apos;t for you.
		I don&apos;t intend to vent either, but the way these questions are posed really makes it hard not to.
		&quot;What are your feelings and attitudes?&quot;?
		Seriously?
		It&apos;s hard to answer honestly without a bit of venting.
		And what does that have to do with the material?
		But I appreciate that you hear me out with what I say.
		Many don&apos;t, and this same list of ten questions is reused for a lot of courses at this school.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		Fourth verse, same as <a href="#Unit1">the first</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am doing a bit better though.
		I&apos;m pretty much completely caught up on everything, and I hope to start the coming week fairly well.
		I make no guarantees that I&apos;ll be able to keep my strength up until the end of the week, but if I get enough done in the first couple days, it won&apos;t even matter.
		The remaining five days can hopefully be a period to recharge and prepare for the week after.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned to actually put together an indexer.
		Even the parts of the code I didn&apos;t write myself, I had to figure out and understand, with the exception of the stemmer.
		I get the general idea of stemming, but the actual inner workings are still a black box to me as I didn&apos;t have the time or energy to actually open up the stemmer (longer than needed to figure out the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> and clean up the white space, anyway) and look at how it functions.
		Using the knowledge I&apos;ve gained though, I could build a rudimentary indexer in another programming language, for example, probably without even looking at the code we worked with this week for reference.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		I was surprised by how easy the process of building an indexer is.
		I&apos;m not going to lie, it did take me quite a few hours to put together.
		But while it was time-consuming, it wasn&apos;t particularly difficult work.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only part that even confused me for any length of time turned out to be a bug introduced because of my lack of familiarity with Python.
		Once I figured out what the bug even was, it was incredibly easy to correct, but until then, it was difficult to fathom where the bad data that was halting my script was even being generated.
		I know Python well enough to write in it, but I never use it when I don&apos;t have to.
		My native language is <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> and I&apos;ve been mostly working in Lua for the past ... probably over a year now.
		In both languages, when you iterate over a data structure, you are presented with both the keys and the values at each iteration.
		In Python, you get only one, and it&apos;s up to you to choose to use the key as what you get, then use the key to retrieve the value.
		It&apos;s an incredibly easy process, and for the most part, I do it effortlessly, but I messed up when I tried to form a pair of nested loops on a two-dimensional dictionary.
		Out of habit, I passed the singular value that changes during each iteration of the outer loop - which was a dictionary key in the form of a string, not a dictionary itself - into the inner loop to be iterated over.
		Instead of getting one of the stemmed term strings I was expecting, I was getting an upper-case &quot;C&quot; at the first iteration, which would then halt the script because that was an unexpected value.
		It confused me to no end, as the terms had to be cast to lower-case before getting stemmed, and the terms in the dictionary should have been already stemmed.
		Even if single-letter terms had made it into the index, none of them should have been upper-case.
		Also, the script was halting because the &quot;C&quot; term it&apos;d found wasn&apos;t a valid term in the index, so when it tried to check another dictionary for data on it, that key/value pair was missing.
		I thought the I was calling the stemmer wrong or something, and things were being correctly stemmed in one case and not another, so one set of keys I had didn&apos;t match the other.
		But no.
		I was passing a string into a <code>for</code> loop to be iterated over, and Python was interpreting that as a request to iterate over <strong>*the individual characters*</strong> in the string.
		&quot;C&quot; was the beginning of a file name.
		<strong>*All*</strong> the file names, actually.
		All the files in our corpus have the same name, save for the trailing digits before the file extension.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my only real challenge so far.
		The work itself is easy enough to understand once I get started.
		I guess the bug described above was a bit of a challenge to deal with for the reasons described, but it was a much lesser challenge.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		Previously, we kind of learned in the abstract how an index is structured.
		Now I&apos;ve learned to actually build code that&apos;ll itself build an index.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		It&apos;s not a new realisation by any means, but I&apos;d forgotten how much better I learn when there&apos;s hands-on work.
		That hands-on work can be a little as simply writing a report on the material as I go, or it can be an actual programming assignment like we had this week.
		This was our first actual programming assignment for this course.
		Last time, we only modified one variable that held a file path.
		You can&apos;t rally call that programming.
		This week though, I got quite familiar with not only the new code I had to add to the script, but even the starter code we were given, which I had to get to know in order to know what needed to be added.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		This has been the most interesting week so far for me, as we it feels like we actually <strong>*did*</strong> something.
		Still, outside of school, this isn&apos;t really something I&apos;ll likely use or apply to my life in any way.
