		My discussion posts for the day:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			All <abbr title="American Psychological Association">APA</abbr> citation guidelines I&apos;ve ever seen say to include the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> unless you didn&apos;t get it online.
			For example, if you read it in a physical copy of a book checked out from your local library, you wouldn&apos;t include a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.
			You mention that <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s of pages can be changed.
			They can be, but best practice dictates that a decent website won&apos;t change their <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s if they can at all avoid doing so.
			Additionally, whether <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s change or not, there&apos;s no way to find the resource without the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, so if no <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> is included, you&apos;ve cited a source that no one is able to verify.
			<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s are absolutely required for practical reasons, and any citation format that would disallow them is fatally flawed and should not be used.
			Again though, this doesn&apos;t apply to <abbr title="American Psychological Association">APA</abbr> format, as <abbr title="American Psychological Association">APA</abbr> format not only allows but requires the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s be included if the document was retrieved from the Web.

			Like you said, culture plays a big part in how we view ourselves and each other.
			Epigenetics may interact with that, but underneath it, it&apos;s the culture that&apos;s the problem, not epigenetics.
			People need to learn to respect one another regardless of their phenotypes.

	<blockquote>

			It&apos;s interesting that you should bring up genetics and sexual orientation.
			A number of factors influence sexual orientation.
			For the time being, sexual orientation in males has been studied more thoroughly than in females, so I&apos;ll use them as an example.
			As you said, one cause of being gay is genetics.
			There&apos;s believed to be an X chromosome gene that can lead to attraction to males regardless of the carrier&apos;s sex.
			In women, this obviously doesn&apos;t make them gay, but in males, is does.
			And because males only inherit a single X chromosome and they get it from their female parent, it leads to a similar situation as the male-pattern baldness gene, which is also passed exclusively though females using the X chromosome.
			I guess you could call it male-pattern gayness.
			However, there&apos;s also a tendency for female bodies to try to feminise infants in the womb.
			With each male child, the female body gets better at it.
			As a result, the more older brothers (or half brothers sharing a mother) a male has, the more likely they&apos;ll end up gay.
			In the first example, with male-pattern gayness, we see being gay not as a phenotype, but instead a genetic trait that would likely be expressed regardless of phenotype.
			In the second example though, we see younger brother gayness as being a phenotype that could be expressed by any male, but due to in-womb hormones, only gets expressed in a small segment of the population.

	<blockquote>

			I fully agree about the rich influencing culture and how people are perceived far more than they should be able to.
			You hit on a very important point though: these views we have on ourselves and one another based on our phenotypes aren&apos;t the fault of the phenotypes themselves, but the fault of the culture.
			When the rich or the majority or whoever controls the culture such that people are looked down upon for their physical differences, it&apos;s a problem and should be addressed.
			That&apos;s easier said than done though.

	<h2>Minetest</h2>

	<p>
		I&apos;ve gotten another section of the water cleared out of the foundation of my future home, but along the way, I ran into a double pocket in the stone filled with silver sand and gravel.
		After clearing the valuable resources from the pocket, it all but depleted my cobble supply to fill it back in.
		Another mining trip is in order.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem with my previous world was that I bit off more than I could chew.
		<strong>*Way*</strong> more.
		And this time, the main goal is to not do that.
		However, regardless of what I can and cannot handle, there are still two monolithic projects that absolutely cannot be avoided.
		Those projects would be the de-sanding of the entire ocean and the mining away of the entire glacier.
		This time though, there are three major changed to my approach.
		First and foremost, I plan to actually get situated in a decent base before undertaking either project.
		Second, I plan to only undertake <strong>*one*</strong> of these projects at a time instead of attempting to work on them both together.
		And most importantly, my approach specifically to the de-sanding project no longer requires the scraping of literally all surface material off the stone of the region and redistributing it.
		That last one&apos;s rather important.
		But then again, all three are.
		My taking on of the glacier-mining project is planned for when I get my first base on the ice sheet built.
		The sand-clearing project has sort of been up in the air though.
		For a few days, I&apos;ve been planning to probably run that project from my based on the island with brown mushrooms.
		If I ran the project from my initial base, I&apos;d be running it without mushroom tools, which I don&apos;t have the patience for.
		Whatever I decide to do though, I knew I&apos;d need to make a decision about whether to run the project from a given base before constructing said base.
		The base I run the project from will need a clay alcove in the main storage room, so not building the clay alcove necessarily means the project would be a pain from that base, while building the clay alcove necessarily means committing to clearing all the sand before moving on from the base.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was painfully slow at work tonight for the last few hours.
		We had all of our stuff done and basically stood around with nothing else to do while waiting to close the store.
		So I thought about my plans, of course.
		What I realised was that wherever I run the de-sanding project from, I&apos;ll end up at the coast of all islands and the main continent.
		While there, I&apos;ll be passing right by various resources and just passing them up because I won&apos;t yet have a base with an alcove for them.
		Resources such as the various sapling types.
		And mushrooms, if I don&apos;t yet have them.
		It was then that I realised that the base I run the de-sanding project will need an alcove for everything in World&apos;s Navel.
		Everything except ice, that is.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that in mind, there&apos;s no reason I need to build a second base before starting the de-sanding project.
		I just need to build my initial base with all the needed alcoves.
		From there, I&apos;ll use the silver sand to line the ocean under the bridges, then use the cobble to build the bridges to the various islands.
		I&apos;ll bridge to the nearby island with brown mushrooms and take a sample.
		I&apos;ll then start the de-sanding project proper and the bridging project proper, collecting resources as they come within reach.
		That means though that my home needs to be re-planned a bit.
		The foundation is the wrong shape.
		In addition to the advantage of not having to try to escape the island and abandon my first major base soon after building it is the advantage that I&apos;ll be gathering all of the resource types that I planed to accumulate and carry with me from base to base right from the initial base.
		That means that I&apos;ll have all the same resources present at all the bases, aside from clay and ice.
		If I have a project to work on that happens to be closer to a older base then to my current one, I can just switch back to the older base and work from there.
		I&apos;ll have all my main materials at my disposal there without needing to carry them as far.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t like to tear out old constructions.
		However, this house has so little of it actually completed so far that I feel like undoing it all qualifies more as a change of plans than the demolition of a historic building of the game world.
		So it should be fine.
