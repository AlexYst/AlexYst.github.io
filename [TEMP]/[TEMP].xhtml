	<h2>Unit 1</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/01bool.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 01bool.pdf</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/02voc.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 02voc.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I suppose my main reaction is thinking that this is easier than I feared it&apos;d be.
		At least for this week, the material was pretty straightforward.
		It might be the case that search engines aren&apos;t as complex as I once thought they were.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The term has just begun, and no assignments have yet been submitted, so there isn&apos;t any feedback yet to report.
		As for interactions, the discussion board assignments have some limited interaction.
		From other students, I read mostly posts about positional indexes to supliment the research I&apos;d done for my own post about bi-word indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		My feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t really worth describing, as they don&apos;t really change much since the school administration started hassling me in various ways.
		Suffice to say though, my feelings and attitudes are quite a hindrance to getting my work done each week, but I always pull through in the end.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned how some types of indexing are performed as well as how indexes are searched.
		In particular, we focused on bi-word indexes and positional indexes.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		One use for searching that I hadn&apos;t considered before is spell-checking.
		I guess I&apos;d never thought about how a spell-checker works.
		It&apos;s surprising to read that it&apos;s done using a searching algorithm, though in retrospect, I guess it shouldn&apos;t be <strong>*that*</strong> surprising.
		As for wondering, I wonder why an index would be referred to as an &quot;inverted index&quot;.
		An index, as defined by the reading material, is an inverted file.
		When you invert something and invert it again, you get back the original.
		However, an &quot;inverted index&quot; isn&apos;t the original file, but actually the same thing as a regular, uninverted index.
		It&apos;s a confusing misnomer, and I wonder why people come up with such counter-intuitive and outright incorrect terms to describe things.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		The only challenge this week was working up the motivation to get to work.
		Doing that has been difficult the past couple years due to garbage constantly thrown at me by the school staff.
		The professors, of course, are guilt-free of this, but the administration&apos;s behaviour has plunged me into a deep depression that makes it difficult to get anything done at all.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning not only how types of indexes are structured - which would be vital for constructing software that&apos;d generate an index for me - but also the strengths and weaknesses of different index formats.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t learn well in the sort of environment this school provides.
		I can get stuff done, but it&apos;s very laborious.
		I find I still have my former love of learning when I&apos;m studying things on my own, but as soon as I try to get going on coursework, I lose the will to actually learn anything.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m not sure.
		I can&apos;t help but feel that searching algorithms could come in very handy at some point, I&apos;m just not sure what I&apos;d use them for just yet.
		One thing that you have to keep in mind is that I&apos;m not a computer person by trade, but only by hobby.
		General business purposes don&apos;t really apply to me like they would students planning to go into database administration or something.
	</p>
	<p>
		I suppose one thing I might be able to use this for is for building a search system for my own website.
		It&apos;s a very small website, but it includes a public journal that&apos;s had daily entries added by me for the past several years.
		It might be nice to add a pre-generated list of pages relevant to various specific topics, and perhaps an auto-generated index could help build those lists.
		(As my site is entirely pre-compiled and static from the perspective of the reader, an actual search feature isn&apos;t possible.)

<section id="Unit2">
	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/03dict.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 03dict.pdf</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/04const.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 04const.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on index types and the programming assignment, which was barely an assignment at all.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		When I saw that the instructions for this week&apos;s assignment wanted us to use &quot;the current version of Python 2&quot;, I wondered how tricky that&apos;d be to get running.
		I thought for sure that Debian 10, my operating system, defaulted to Python 3.*, and I know that Python 3 isn&apos;t compatible with all Python 2 scripts.
		I knew 2.* and 3.* are both available in the Debian repository but I wasn&apos;t sure how to configure Debian to use 2.* if I installed it.
		Thankfully, running <code>python --version</code> showed me that I have 2.7.16 installed; that must be Debian&apos;s preinstalled default then.
		That was easy.
		Out of curiosity though, I checked online to see if this was indeed the current version.
		As it turns out, support for Python 2.7 is an end-of-life release for the 2.* series, and support for it was dropped on 2020-01-01.
		That means there <strong>*is no*</strong> &quot;current&quot; version of Python 2 any more.
		It&apos;s interesting that it&apos;s still the default in Debian then.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note, the assignment instructions also claims that while Windows uses forward slashes as directory separators in file paths while Linux uses backslashes.
		This is completely and absolutely false.
		Linux (and in fact most operating systems) uses <strong>*forward slashes*</strong> for path separators.
		Windows is the odd one out that uses backslashes.
		To try to be a bit compatible with normal file paths though, Windows does allow forward slashes to be used instead of backslashes though.
		So to put it simply, Windows uses both forward slashes and backslashes, while everyone else including Linux uses only forward slashes.
		I hope this gets fixed in the assignment instructions for next term.
		On the topic of incorrect information that should be updated, the assignment instructions also claim that the parts of the code shown in the instructions are in bold.
		The entire script is shown in italics, but nothing is in bold.
		I wouldn&apos;t necessarily say that the use of a bold type face should be used as it&apos;s easy to find the parts that need to be edited, but if a bold type face isn&apos;t used, the part claiming that it is should be removed.
		Hopefully, that too will be updated for next term.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the sounds of the instructions, the assignment was to modify the variable containing the path to the corpus of documents we were instructed to download, then add statistics reporting.
		The actual parsing of the files and the generation of the database files was already programmed for us, with the exception of a file that we&apos;d be programming the generation of in a later assignment.
		After verifying my Python setup and changing the one variable though, I just ran the script.
		I figured that if there were any errors in the code or my setup that interfered, I&apos;d catch and correct them before having put in any actual effort in developing anything.
		Much to my surprise though, the script output exactly the statistics we were instructed to have it report.
		Just like that.
		No effort on my part.
		At all.
		So ... I don&apos;t get the assignment.
		Was the assignment just to change one variable to reflect were we&apos;d extracted the files on our local machines?
		I&apos;m not complaining.
		It later turned out to be a long week for me and I had two nights where I didn&apos;t even go to bed and instead had to stay awake for about forty hours straight.
		An easy assignment that doesn&apos;t require me to spend another night sleepless was definitely welcome.
		It did seem rather underwhelming and pointless though.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The only feedback so far is for the learning journal, and thankfully, the professor this term seems fine with my format.
		I never know how I&apos;ll do on these open-ended learning journal assignments on the first week, as different professors have different preferences.
		I&apos;ve had professors mark me down for writing too much, then when I write less the next week to correct my mistake, they write me down for writing too little ...
		And some don&apos;t like the questions separated into sections with the questions used as headings and want it in free-form paragraph style, while some want the separate headings to make it easier to see that all the questions were answered ...
		Getting it right on the first week makes it easier to write my learning journal assignments on later weeks, as I can pretty much just do the same thing again.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		As mentioned <a href="#Unit1">last week</a>, my feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t great, but that&apos;s to be expected given my situation.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned more concretely how indexes are formatted.
		It&apos;s one thing to read it in a book, but it&apos;s another to actually see the output files generated by an indexer.
		Even though we didn&apos;t actually build the indexer - it was just given to us - we were still able to see the original files and the files built by the indexer.
		Were were also free to run the indexer on files of our own to experiment.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		It baffles me that blocked sort-based indexing uses document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s instead of file names and term strings.
		It seems rather arbitrary not to use the identifiers inherent to the things at hand and instead assign numeric identifiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		It&apos;s also surprising that the indexer we&apos;re working with assigns <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s starting from one instead of zero.
		It&apos;s counter-intuitive.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my main challenge.
		The work isn&apos;t difficult.
		Getting myself to even get started on the work, however, really is.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning the strengths and weaknesses of index formats.
		I don&apos;t think a blocked sort-based index would be right for me, were I to build an automated indexer for my website.
		I&apos;d want to be able to read the index by hand to see what had been indexed, and the document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s being used instead of file names and term strings would make it incredibly hard to do that.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t do well here; not that there&apos;s anything I can do about it.
		I muddle through, but it&apos;s very stressful and I end up having to spend sleepless nights to get anything done.
		Twice this week, I had to pull all-nighters and stay awake for about forty hours at a time.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m still not sure.
		I&apos;m still not sure I&apos;d ever need to build an index of anything.
		There&apos;s a chance I might build one for my website, which I brought up the possibility of last week, though I don&apos;t see me getting to that any time soon.
		I have so many sub-projects for my website that I just haven&apos;t gotten to, and an indexer would be pretty low on the list, not to mention that I&apos;ve got non-website stuff going on as well.
		The thing you have to understand is that I&apos;ll probably never even apply for a computer-related job.
		I program as a hobby, not for employment.
	</p>
	<p>
		These sorts of questions are sort of odd; I&apos;m not sure why assignments ask them of students.
		The required courses for a degree are so varied that the topics of every course a student takes can&apos;t apply to every student.
		To put that another way, every student is asked how the material applies to them, but in most cases, the student took the course because it&apos;s required for the degree and not because the material will ever be relevant to them.
		For example, required courses at this school include this course on information retrieval, a course on Web development, a course on Linux, a course on Windows, a course on <abbr title="three-dimensional">3D</abbr> graphics, a course on Java, and a course on Python, among others.
		What profession makes use of all of that?
		Don&apos;t get me wrong, the material of this course is interesting, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll use it in a meaningful context.
		I know for a fact that the material from the Windows course isn&apos;t something I&apos;ll ever use.

	<h2>Unit 3</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/05comp.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 05comp.pdf</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on estimating index vocabulary sizes.
		I also graded submissions that were submitted by students last week.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;ve been rather behind, and I&apos;m trying to catch up.
		Having another slow week like this should have helped.
		I&apos;ve been doing a bit better emotionally lately, so I shouldn&apos;t fall so far behind again, but catching up from before is a challenge, especially because of my shifted schedule at work.
		I no longer have the days off that I need most.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also noticed the output again from the script.
		It clearly has minute-level precision in the output of what time it starts and stops.
		I&apos;d mentioned it having second-level precision in my own submission.
		That&apos;s embarrassing.
		It makes me look like an absolute imbecile that can&apos;t understand basic time displays.
		I was running on so little sleep that week, which is likely why I made such an obvious error, but the students grading it aren&apos;t going to know that.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		The only feedback so far is for the learning journal.
		You mention your child overthinking the work and having to stay up for two days straight, similar to how I&apos;ve been staying up for two days straight.
		I&apos;m sorry to hear that, but also envious that that was the only issue.
		For me, even working up the motivation has been problematic.
		I know the work is fairly simple, and I still can&apos;t get myself to do it.
		I tell myself I have to do it before I can go to bed, then I can&apos;t get myself to even look at it, then have to stay up increasingly late.
		I&apos;ve been learning some stuff about emotional management though recently.
		I actually talked myself into going off on a couple of my workmates that are rather disrespectful, which is something I just don&apos;t do.
		I just sit there and deal with mistreatment.
		At the end of this week, I actually had a couple days were I was feeling outright chipper.
		Working up motivation is still a problem, but it should be less of an issue as I better tackle the unrelated disrespect issue that has been likewise weighing me down.
		I&apos;ll have more energy to put toward pushing myself to get the coursework done earlier in the week.
	</p>
	<p>
		You mention potentially needing to do some serious big data analysis and needing an index to aid in that.
		That does sound like a great time to use index-building/-managing skills, though the chances I&apos;ll be doing anything computer-related for employment is incredibly small.
		I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;d have such a big data set for as far as personal work, as that seems like something a large, evil company might want to use for targeted marketing or something.
		(I&apos;m not suggesting that large companies are always evil, but targeted marketing using large data sets usually involves invading people&apos;s privacy, so that use of large data sets is only done by companies that at least have an evil side to them.)
	</p>
	<p>
		As for undergrad being like extended high school ...
		I&apos;d rather go back to high school.
		At least my high school didn&apos;t censor me or write me off.
		This school is doing both, and the censorship is the reason I can&apos;t work up the motivation to get anything school-related done in a timely manner.
		Before the censorship, I used to get the bulk of my work done in the first couple days, then spend the rest of the time refining and expanding on it.
		I used to be a fabulous student.
		Now I&apos;m a rather shoddy one that can barely meet deadlines.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the value of a computer science degree getting you past human resources, I fully agree.
		Having a degree in anything makes a huge difference, and that&apos;s the only reason I haven&apos;t given up fully yet.
		If not for that, I&apos;d dropped out by now.
		I don&apos;t know what to get a job in, so I don&apos;t know what sort of degree to pursue.
		Just having a degree at all, even if it&apos;s not a relevant degree, will get you into a lot of jobs though.
		While the chances that I&apos;d find a computer-related job that didn&apos;t force me to violate my principles and make me hate myself (all software I write has freely-licensed source code that&apos;s available for everyone to read, use, and modify, and nothing will ever get me to change that) is slim, out of not knowing what degree to get, I&apos;m working on a computer science degree, figuring at least some of it will apply to my personal life.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		As mentioned in <a href="#Unit1">Unit 1</a>, my feelings and attitudes aren&apos;t great, but that&apos;s to be expected given my situation.
		Things are unexpectedly improving a bit though, so we&apos;ll see how that goes.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned about estimations of index vocabulary size, as well as how widely an estimation can vary if it&apos;s not done with proper values.
		You really need to take the time to get your estimation right, or it won&apos;t be.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		It surprised me how widely estimations based on Heap&apos;s law can be.
		It looks like such a simple equation, but every variable is something you have to measure or estimate, and those estimations can cause terrible results if done poorly.
		An estimation can be up to nearly 77 times as large as it should, or a bit over one seventy-seventh the size of the real value.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my only real challenge so far.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning how to apply Heap&apos;s law to estimate vocabulary size before running an indexer, so as to know about how much space the index might take up.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		This same question is asked week after week, but there&apos;s not new things learned about my learning style so often.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		So far, I&apos;m still not sure.
		I&apos;m almost certainly not going to get a computer-related job, let alone a job that&apos;d specifically be helped along by building and/or managing an index.
		It&apos;s interesting stuff for sure, but not particularly applicable to my life.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Unit4">
	<h2>Unit 4</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/06vect.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 06vect.pdf</a>, <a href="https://en.youscribe.com/BookReader/Index/521048/?documentId=492171">Term Vector Fast Track Tutorial</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">Cosine similarity - Wikipedia</a>.
		I also participated in the discussion assignment on inverse document frequencies and parametric and zone indexes, then completed the programming assignment for the week.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I cleaned up the starter code this week before I worked with it.
		Namely, I removed all carriage returns (as they&apos;re redundant) and converted all space-based indention to use tabs instead (the tab character is literally a character dedicated to indentation; semantically, tabs are the <strong>*only*</strong> proper way to indent anything unless you&apos;re using some of the fancy, multi-byte indentation characters in Unicode, which are overkill for code and probably not supported by Python anyway).
		Last week, we only changed one line of the script, so the white space mess didn&apos;t really affect me.
		This time though, we did more-extensive editing, and I needed a clean starting point so my own clean changes would be consistent.
		I didn&apos;t even <strong>*think*</strong> to test the cleaned code before starting my own modifications to it for the week.
		I started getting an odd issue when I tried to test my features though: the number of tokens found was always equal to the number of documents processed.
		One token per document?
		That couldn&apos;t be right.
		Had I broken something so documents weren&apos;t getting tokenised, and whole-document tokens were being used?
		After giving up on trying to find the error by eye, I reverted all my changes, only to find the error persisted.
		It was the cleaning process that had broken the code.
		I downloaded a new copy and tried cleaning that again, and found the error was related to the indentation, not the carriage returns.
		Looking through the code, I found that there exists a single tab character in the entire original file.
		I remember that Python considers tabs to be equivalent to eight spaces, but the original code does most of its indentation by four spaces.
		For some reason, this one single line used a tab and four spaces to indent by three levels, which is completely inconsistent with the rest of the code.
		So that one tab actually needed to be converted into two tabs.
		An easy fix, but only after wasting half an hour or so trying to find what even needed to be fixed.
		It was only the token counter that was affected too, not the actual tokenisation process.
		And speaking of indentation inconsistencies, some lines actually indent using two spaces for some reason, so the singular tab character isn&apos;t the only indentation inconsistency in the file, it&apos;s just the only one that I missed when I cleaned the code.
		Whoever wrote this code needs to work on their consistency.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, long story short, using indentation as a form of syntax was a terrible design choice on the part of the Python developers.
		While these inconsistencies shouldn&apos;t show up in decently-written code, it doesn&apos;t mean that they should cause errors in how the code is executed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The other thing I quickly found bothersome was that the index files were contaminating the input of the indexer next time it got run.
		I noticed that last week, too, but again, I didn&apos;t need to run the indexer a bunch of times so I ignored it.
		Honestly, the proper solution would be to put the index files outside the directory of files getting indexed, but in order to keep clean lines between what I added and what was a part of the original script, I had been putting comments around my code to show what I&apos;d added.
		I couldn&apos;t do that for partial line changes, so I just had the indexer delete the index files after checking to see if they were present before checking the directory for files to index.
		That worked as expected, and made subsequent runs of the indexer provide proper output instead of contaminated output.
	</p>
	<p>
		I got the stemmer use, stop words, and display of the new statistics implemented with minimal difficulty.
		I found one mistake I made particularly hilarious though.
		On assignments such as these, I tend to write my comments on a section of code just before I write the code, so I can more-carefully document what I&apos;m thinking before I lose some of those thoughts, which always happens after I have things implemented.
		I wrote in my comments that the stemmer we were given wants to know where the last character in the string is, so we should pass the length of the string minus one.
		I then immediately proceeded to forget to subtract one in the actual code, so the script halted with a very obvious error message.
		In my defence, it was a rush job, as I&apos;d been working on the assignment on most of my ten-minute breaks at work, so I didn&apos;t have much time to get into code what I was thinking, but still, kind of funny.
		That&apos;s not to say that I didn&apos;t spend a few hours at home working on this too, but I did what I could at work as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moving on to the generation of the data that&apos;d be stored in the third file, I was kind of at a loss at first.
		I read the script, and quite confusingly to me, it pours all the tokens from all the files into one big pile before processing a single one of them.
		It doesn&apos;t process them one at a time, which means that when each token is processed, the script has lost track of what file the token even came from.
		How in Squiddy&apos;s name was I supposed to add stuff to the script there that&apos;d link the term to the document?
		I&apos;d either have to make some heavy modifications to the existing code - and I&apos;d been trying to avoid deleting even a single line of the original code, save for the line telling the script what directory to use, so such heavy rewrites would be far less than ideal - or I&apos;d need to program a second pass over the documents, which seemed rather inefficient.
		I started looking over the index files though, and started to realise it really didn&apos;t matter.
		Even if the script knew what file the term was from, it wouldn&apos;t have the proper term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s yet.
		The terms need to all be found so they can be sorted.
		The <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s can then be assigned in a sane, sequential order.
		A second pass over the documents was pretty much mandatory anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
		The assigned <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s though ... They&apos;re indexed from one.
		Zero is just skipped.
		I&apos;ve been trying to ignore it, and I&apos;ve been telling myself that it&apos;s fine because I didn&apos;t decide on the format of the generated files.
		However, I now had to completely write the part of the code that&apos;d generate the third file, and the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s would be used there.
		I had to fix the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s.
		Thankfully, the fix was pretty easy.
		And in fact, it looks like indexing from one might be a bug in the code.
		Two variables are used for keeping track of the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s that need to be assigned next.
		They&apos;re initialised to zero.
		However, instead of incrementing the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s each time after an <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is assigned, the value is incremented <strong>*before*</strong> the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is assigned, including before the first time an <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> is assigned.
		That results in the initial value of the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> variables simply getting skipped over.
		At first, I figured I&apos;d just add another comment-delimited segment that changed the variables to start at negative one.
		It&apos;d have a double assignment before use, but it&apos;d function correctly.
		In the end though, I decided that rearranging lines didn&apos;t count as deletion, and just fixed the actual bug by reversing the two consecutive lines of code that appeared in the wrong order, in both places.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking of the index format, I noticed that the two files the provided code outputs uses a comma-separated value format.
		However, as some terms end in a comma and we&apos;re not doing anything about that just yet, commas meant as part of the values are ending up in the file in addition to the ones used for data structure.
		The commas aren&apos;t even escaped in any way, which again, bothers me.
		It&apos;s not my problem, as I&apos;m not supposed to decide on the format of these files, but it made me think I&apos;d want to have my third file, which I <strong>*do*</strong> design, use a tab-separated structure instead.
		That way, the commas in the stored data wouldn&apos;t matter.
		I later realised that that was a moot point though, as the terms don&apos;t even appear in the file I&apos;d be designing.
		Instead, the term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s would be used.
		I ended up proceeding with the tab-separated structure anyway though, as it&apos;s easier to look through in a text editor if you&apos;re trying to read the output.
	</p>
	<p>
		One last thing was kind of bothering me even before I started working on the actual code that&apos;d perform the second pass.
		I was only to have the code generate a single extra file, which would have a line for each document/term pair.
		However, one stat I was to find and store was the document frequency: the number of documents associated with the term.
		That stat is specific to the term, not the document/term pair, so it&apos;d be the same for each document/term pair that has that same term.
		For example, if the term &quot;potato&quot; was found in twenty documents, the &quot;20&quot; statistic would be stored in the file twenty times.
		It&apos;d make much more sense to generate a fourth file with these sorts of per-term statistics that didn&apos;t vary between documents that include the term.
	</p>
	<p>
		After writing up most of my final solution, I went back to thinking this could have been done in a single pass after all.
		I was using terms and document names themselves all throughout my internal data structures and only converting into IDs just before writing the data to the file.
		If the code given to us wasn&apos;t dumping all the tokens from all the files into one big pile - or if I was up to modifying that part of the code - this could have totally been done in a single pass.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		No one commented on my inability to tell seconds from minutes - or hardly commented at all, really - on my submission from two weeks ago.
		I&apos;ll take that.
		Maybe no one noticed what an idiot I was when I submitted that.
		There wasn&apos;t much to say about the &quot;project&quot; either, if it could even be called that, so it makes sense there wouldn&apos;t really be any other feedback on it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for my learning journal submission from last week ...
		You say not to let little things get in the way, but censorship is no little thing.
		It requires me not to be open, which is contrary to every fibre of my being.
		It hurts.
		Badly.
		Every minute I spend on coursework is a minute I&apos;m not allowed to talk about, and that makes it very difficult to work up the motivation to work on coursework at all.
		As for what censorship, the school issued a takedown request directed at me and my website telling me to take down my discussion of my studies from my public journal, and made sure to include threats in it.
		They said if I didn&apos;t remove what I&apos;d written about my journey here at the university, I&apos;d be expelled and/or retroactively failed from all my courses.
		They couldn&apos;t even have the decency to try asking nicely before resorting to threats.
		It caused me so much emotional distress that I was incapacitated for a few days, mostly just laying in bed with a killer headache.
		I recovered from the headache, but the stress and the lethargy won&apos;t go away until the censorship does, and that&apos;s only going to happen once I&apos;ve graduated and left this school.
		This place has me down so much I literally wrote some code that displays a countdown for me telling me how many days I have left stuck here just to help me see the light at the end of the tunnel.
		Had the school asked nicely, I would have taken it all down without complaint and without any mental or emotional damage to myself.
		But no.
		The school would rather throw their weight around whether they need to in order to get their way or not.
		And the school has a pretty heavy influence on the students, so throwing that sort of weight around is going to cause some equally-heavy damage.
		
		I get that the school and the staff here are underfunded.
		That&apos;s an excuse for much of what goes on here, including the lack of tech support and the getting written off by staff members, but that will never be an excuse for something as vile as censorship.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be clear, my professors have always been fantastic at best or inattentive at worst.
		They have <strong>*never*</strong> pulled any of the garbage that&apos;s been draining the life out of me for the past couple years.
		And yeah, it&apos;s been a couple years now, meaning that the recent pandemic has nothing to do with the problem.
		My records indicate that the takedown letter was received and acted upon on 2017-11-01, so it&apos;s been a while of living this way.
		I do appreciate all that you do for us to help us attend an affordable school.
		I wouldn&apos;t be able to pay for schooling if it weren&apos;t for you.
		I don&apos;t intend to vent either, but the way these questions are posed really makes it hard not to.
		&quot;What are your feelings and attitudes?&quot;?
		Seriously?
		It&apos;s hard to answer honestly without a bit of venting.
		And what does that have to do with the material?
		But I appreciate that you hear me out with what I say.
		Many don&apos;t, and this same list of ten questions is reused for a lot of courses at this school.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		Fourth verse, same as <a href="#Unit1">the first</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am doing a bit better though.
		I&apos;m pretty much completely caught up on everything, and I hope to start the coming week fairly well.
		I make no guarantees that I&apos;ll be able to keep my strength up until the end of the week, but if I get enough done in the first couple days, it won&apos;t even matter.
		The remaining five days can hopefully be a period to recharge and prepare for the week after.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned to actually put together an indexer.
		Even the parts of the code I didn&apos;t write myself, I had to figure out and understand, with the exception of the stemmer.
		I get the general idea of stemming, but the actual inner workings are still a black box to me as I didn&apos;t have the time or energy to actually open up the stemmer (longer than needed to figure out the <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> and clean up the white space, anyway) and look at how it functions.
		Using the knowledge I&apos;ve gained though, I could build a rudimentary indexer in another programming language, for example, probably without even looking at the code we worked with this week for reference.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		I was surprised by how easy the process of building an indexer is.
		I&apos;m not going to lie, it did take me quite a few hours to put together.
		But while it was time-consuming, it wasn&apos;t particularly difficult work.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only part that even confused me for any length of time turned out to be a bug introduced because of my lack of familiarity with Python.
		Once I figured out what the bug even was, it was incredibly easy to correct, but until then, it was difficult to fathom where the bad data that was halting my script was even being generated.
		I know Python well enough to write in it, but I never use it when I don&apos;t have to.
		My native language is <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> and I&apos;ve been mostly working in Lua for the past ... probably over a year now.
		In both languages, when you iterate over a data structure, you are presented with both the keys and the values at each iteration.
		In Python, you get only one, and it&apos;s up to you to choose to use the key as what you get, then use the key to retrieve the value.
		It&apos;s an incredibly easy process, and for the most part, I do it effortlessly, but I messed up when I tried to form a pair of nested loops on a two-dimensional dictionary.
		Out of habit, I passed the singular value that changes during each iteration of the outer loop - which was a dictionary key in the form of a string, not a dictionary itself - into the inner loop to be iterated over.
		Instead of getting one of the stemmed term strings I was expecting, I was getting an upper-case &quot;C&quot; at the first iteration, which would then halt the script because that was an unexpected value.
		It confused me to no end, as the terms had to be cast to lower-case before getting stemmed, and the terms in the dictionary should have been already stemmed.
		Even if single-letter terms had made it into the index, none of them should have been upper-case.
		Also, the script was halting because the &quot;C&quot; term it&apos;d found wasn&apos;t a valid term in the index, so when it tried to check another dictionary for data on it, that key/value pair was missing.
		I thought the I was calling the stemmer wrong or something, and things were being correctly stemmed in one case and not another, so one set of keys I had didn&apos;t match the other.
		But no.
		I was passing a string into a <code>for</code> loop to be iterated over, and Python was interpreting that as a request to iterate over <strong>*the individual characters*</strong> in the string.
		&quot;C&quot; was the beginning of a file name.
		<strong>*All*</strong> the file names, actually.
		All the files in our corpus have the same name, save for the trailing digits before the file extension.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my only real challenge so far.
		The work itself is easy enough to understand once I get started.
		I guess the bug described above was a bit of a challenge to deal with for the reasons described, but it was a much lesser challenge.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		Previously, we kind of learned in the abstract how an index is structured.
		Now I&apos;ve learned to actually build code that&apos;ll itself build an index.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		It&apos;s not a new realisation by any means, but I&apos;d forgotten how much better I learn when there&apos;s hands-on work.
		That hands-on work can be a little as simply writing a report on the material as I go, or it can be an actual programming assignment like we had this week.
		This was our first actual programming assignment for this course.
		Last time, we only modified one variable that held a file path.
		You can&apos;t rally call that programming.
		This week though, I got quite familiar with not only the new code I had to add to the script, but even the starter code we were given, which I had to get to know in order to know what needed to be added.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		This has been the most interesting week so far for me, as we it feels like we actually <strong>*did*</strong> something.
		Still, outside of school, this isn&apos;t really something I&apos;ll likely use or apply to my life in any way.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Unit5">
	<h2>Unit 5</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/07system.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 07system.pdf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">Cosine similarity - Wikipedia</a>, then completed the discussion assignment on types of queries.
		I also graded work from last week and built a search engine to use with the index created by last week&apos;s indexer.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		The instructions for the project this week claim that last week&apos;s project included having our indexers ignore purely-numeric tokens.
		That scared me for a bit.
		I thought I&apos;d missed something in last week&apos;s project instructions!
		I didn&apos;t though.
		I went back and looked, and that wasn&apos;t actually a thing we had our indexers do.
		It was something I&apos;d thought about and was going to comment on in my write-up and forgot to, but it was never something that we were supposed to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the programming assignment, I figured having the example code to start from would make things quicker, but I ended up not using any of it.
		Unlike our past assignments, this time, the example code wasn&apos;t a required starting point, but one we could use if we happened to want to.
		I ended up just building the entire thing from scratch.
		It took longer than expected, but I think I was better able to demonstrate my understanding of the material that way.
	</p>
	<p>
		I forgot to take the quiz this week.
		By the time I noticed the quiz was there, it was already too late.
		That was frustrating.
		I should have a good enough grade in the course to still pass even getting a zero on the quiz, but it&apos;s an unnecessary setback that I shouldn&apos;t have caused myself.
		I thought I was going to be on top of things this week, but I wasn&apos;t as on top of things as I wanted to be.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		Yeah, I actually do keep a diary.
		<a href="https://y.st./en/weblog/">My daily entries going back as far as 2015-03-07</a> are online, though because of censorship from the school, a great many of them aren&apos;t currently available to be read and are completely redacted.
		I had a diary going even further back, but there was a data loss incident in which I lost everything I had in the digital world, including my journal and my passwords to all my accounts, including my domain registrar accounts.
		I normally keep a backup, but I put everything on the backup, wiped my drive, then by the time I went to copy the backup back to my main machine, the backup drive had died on me.
		I keep more backup copies these days.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> website you recommended is interesting.
		It seems like the kind of site I could get lost on for hours, just reading through different articles.
		That said, many of the articles with more interesting titles are behind a paywall, and I find those rather irritating.
		I&apos;m not sure about writing any myself, anyway.
		First, I&apos;d need something worthwhile to contribute.
		These days, I barely have anything left in me after I get out my entries on my daily grind.
		Once some of the main stresses of my life are taken care of though, I might give it a try.
		I need to finish school first so I have the energy and I might need to at least start vocal therapy first so I have the confidence.
		I&apos;ve been on the waiting list for over a year, and was supposed to get in two terms ago.
		But then the pandemic hit and everything closed down.
		Life is pretty much on hold for me for now because of that.
		I was hoping to have found a better job by now, but I can&apos;t even search for one until my voice is at least partly fixed.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		Overall, I&apos;m still lethargic and beat down.
		I was feeling decently well about this week though, until I realised I&apos;d failed to take the quiz.
		Now I&apos;m a bit frustrated and irritated.
		There&apos;s nothing for it though.
		That was my mistake, and I&apos;ll deal with the consequences.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned how to build a search engine that operates over a pre-generated index.
		(The pre-generated index, of course, having been generated by code I&apos;d worked with previously.)
		Honestly, I&apos;m not sure I did it right in my submission.
		My search engine operates on terms and document names internally, not <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s.
		The <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s are translated into human-readable strings to match against user input, rather than translating user input into <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and matching them against the database.
		Given the short amount of time we have for these assignments, this was the easiest for my brain to process.
		The search engine works though, and with more time and thought, I could implement this properly.
		Or &quot;properly&quot;, anyway.
		I&apos;m not sure there&apos;s a right or wrong implementation, it&apos;s just a matter of what sort of efficiency you&apos;re trying to optimise for.
		By translating into human-readable strings, I made programming and debugging easier, optimising for programmer time.
		For a larger search engine, or rather, a search engine with a larger index, you&apos;d want to optimise for memory usage and processing time instead.
		Regardless of whether my strategy this week was &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, I understand the concepts necessary to implement this either way now.
		If I built this again, I could translate the user input into <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and match it against the database.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		I was surprised that I didn&apos;t need the example code this week.
		The assignment was pretty straightforward.
		I opened up the file and looked at it (Why was the source code provided in the form of a LibreOffice Writer document and not a source code (plain text) file? That&apos;s asinine.), but didn&apos;t actually look through it much.
		I noticed the note at the top reminding us that we needed our version to return only results that include all the terms, not just at least one of them, and that was the only thing that really influenced my code.
		I missed that in the assignment instructions, and though I later did see that in the assignment instructions when I was double-checking that my code was meeting the requirements, it was only after I&apos;d completed quite a bit of it.
		I also checked the example code for clarification in a couple parts, but all the parts I checked were actually omitted from the example code, so there was nothing there to influence me.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my only real challenge so far.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was also having trouble understanding what the cosine similarity equation was supposed to mean.
		It includes mathematical symbols I&apos;m not familiar with, not to mention that I was completely misunderstanding what it was operating on.
		I was trying to plug in the two terms entered by the user as the two variables, rather than the document as one variable and the user&apos;s query as the other variable.
		That resulted in much confusion as i tried to figure out how to deal with queries that had more terms than that.
		If a user entered <strong>*three*</strong> terms, what was I to even do with that?
		I hadn&apos;t even thought about one-term queries, but they would have given me problems too.
		I ended up looking up probably a dozen pages that didn&apos;t really explain what I wasn&apos;t getting until I found a page with a particularly poor explanation.
		It had an example though.
		While nothing in the example was explained whatsoever, it did show two vectors of numbers, and those numbers showed up in the example equation.
		I was able to piece it together from there, and substituted the numbers for the weighted term frequencies.
		That has the odd effect of making the number of times the user puts the same term into a given query have an effect on the sorting of the results, but I&apos;m pretty sure I did it right.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;m learning to build search engines.
		At one point in the past, I built a Web crawler that downloaded pages, though all it did was keep track of <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s and document titles because of my small hard drive.
		It collected new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s from hyperlinks, cleaned them up, and used them to find new pages to crawl.
		If I combined that spider-related knowledge with the knowledge I&apos;ve gained in this course about indexing and search engines, I could build a working Web search engine if I had the drive space for one.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		Nothing new, really.
		I learn by either writing or building, and I have trouble grasping equations that use mathematical symbols that I&apos;m not familiar with.
		None of this is particularly groundbreaking.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		As mentioned before, I built a Web crawler once.
		It was designed to probe onion space and find new websites available through the <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> network.
		Some of those websites were ... less than savoury ... so it had a blacklist feature that allowed me to permanently block from getting indexed any site that seemed illegal to me.
		The blacklist even used hashes, rather than actual domain names, so you couldn&apos;t use the blacklist to help you find illegal content.
		Anyway, given more computational resources, it could be a fun project to start work on the spider again and try to build an onion space search engine.
		One that can actually search for documents based on the content of the pages.
		Those things exist, but it could be fun to see if I can do it better.
	</p>
</section>
<section id="Unit6">
	<h2>Unit 6</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/08eval.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 08eval.pdf</a> and participated in the discussion on information retrieval system statistics.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		With no main assignment this week, I had nothing to really react to.
		It was interesting though to see how accuracy, which seems to be the most technically correct statistic for measuring the performance of an information retrieval system, also seemed to be the most useless of the measures we looked at.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<h4>Unit 4 assignment</h4>
	<p>
		Mostly, there wasn&apos;t any feedback, which was fine.
		The one piece of feedback though was that the student wanted me to attach my code as a separate upload instead of including it in my submission within <code>&lt;pre/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code/&gt;</code>tags.
		They even marked me down by twenty percent just because they didn&apos;t like the way I submitted my code, even though I&apos;d submitted perfectly-functional code that met all the requirements.
		That seriously irritated me!
		I find it cumbersome to grade when people attach things as separate files.
		It&apos;s much easier for me to get the grading done if everything is just inline so I can read it in the browser and doesn&apos;t require me to download things and open them in other applications.
		I&apos;ve <strong>*never*</strong> marked someone down for not submitting the way I&apos;d prefer work submitted though.
		If the grading instructions don&apos;t specify a specific way the work should be submitted, any working submission style should do.
	</p>
	<p>
		By the time it came time to write about the feedback though, I&apos;d stopped caring.
		Unless something is particularly problematic, I simply don&apos;t have the energy to care for long.
	</p>
	<h4>Learning journal Unit 5</h4>
	<p>
		I used to set alarms on my computer too, but since the last operating system update, the software I used to use is unavailable.
		I&apos;ve tried other software, but it either doesn&apos;t work, I can&apos;t figure it out, or it runs commands when the alarms go off instead of emitting a sound.
		I could make the latter work if I had the energy to figure out how to write a command to emit sound, but I&apos;m too drained for that.
	</p>
	<p>
		I use long, random strings for my passwords and store them in my password manager.
		When I lost my data, I lost <strong>*all*</strong> my accounts, including my domain registration accounts, so I lost my domains.
		I had to just about start over with everything.
		The two accounts I got back were my credit card account and my credit union account.
		Everything else had to be replaced.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&apos;ll look into <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> a little later.
		In particular, Ghost seems to be the better of the two options.
		It seems it costs to set up an account there, but the software is under the <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> license, which strongly aligns with my core values.
		It&apos;d be worth it to support ethically-licensed software.
	</p>
	<p>
		Don&apos;t worry, I don&apos;t sweat the little things.
		And I&apos;m not overly concerned with grades either, as long as I pass my courses and don&apos;t have to take them again.
		What I&apos;m sweating though isn&apos;t little stuff.
		The main thing that bogs me down and pulls me down into this lethargic state is mostly the censorship imposed on me by the school, and to a greater extent, the forceful and threatening manner in which that censorship is applied.
		I need my freedom of speech.
		And it&apos;s been scientifically proven that such metal and emotional needs are interpreted by the brain the same as physical needs.
		Not having my freedom of speech has a serious, negative, and very real impact on not only my mental state, but my physical one.
		This censorship is no small matter and isn&apos;t something I can just shrug off.
		For context, in the thirteen years I&apos;ve been working at my current workplace, I&apos;ve only gotten angry at work three times.
		I get frustrated at times, but at worst, that frustration only lasts until the end of the day.
		When I say I don&apos;t let the small stuff get to me, I&apos;m not joking.
		Something has to be pretty bad before it gets me in such a serious and impactful way like this.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for getting someone to look at my crawler, that&apos;d be nice.
		It can&apos;t happen any time soon though.
		As long as I&apos;m under this censorship, I really don&apos;t have the energy to devote to building the thing again.
		I&apos;m barely functional as a human being.
		Lately, I frequently don&apos;t even have the energy to make dinner or fold my laundry, let alone build complex software.
		You did say I need to finish my bachelor&apos;s degree first though, so if the offer still stands then, I might very well take you up on that.
		Once my degree is finished, I can spend some time recovering, then I can get back to programming things such as search engines.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		This week was rather slow, so it was almost like a sort of mini break for me.
		I wouldn&apos;t need those under normal conditions, but these days, mini breaks are much appreciated.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned that measures being accurate for what they measure and measures being useful to the one performing the measurement aren&apos;t always the same thing.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		It&apos;s surprising just how useless the accuracy statistic is.
		I mean, when you look at <strong>*why*</strong> it&apos;s so useless, it makes perfect sense.
		I understand why it&apos;s useless, but that uselessness is still rather counter-intuitive.
		Instead, the f-measure, which appears on first glance to be needlessly complex given the job, turns out to be the superior measure for the general case, with the statistics of precision and recall being better for certain specific cases.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my only real challenge so far.
		No other challenges presented themselves this week.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I like to think I&apos;m getting better about not taking things at face value and instead looking deeper, but I&apos;m not sure how much I&apos;m actually absorbing that lesson given my state of mind.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		Nothing new.
		I still learn by doing and by writing.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		Complex statistics are sometimes better than straightforward ones.
		I&apos;m not sure how to apply these specific statistics in my life, but I&apos;ve dealt with this sort of issue in the past.
		I tried for years to solve this one statistics-based issue a while back using basic multiplication and that never went well.
		It was only when I added logarithms and exponents that I finally arrived at the desired solution.
		Or the desired problem, in my case.
		I had the solution all along, and just needed to derive the problem from it.
		I guess it&apos;s not exactly the same, but the concept of the simple solution - despite providing what would appear to be the correct answer - not providing a <strong>*useful*</strong> answer sort of applies.

	<h2>Unit 7</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/19web.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 19web.pdf</a>, participated in the discussion on creating a Web crawler and the differences between static and dynamic content, and built a Web spider.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		The assignment instructions said we could use BeautifulSoup and that it is included as a module in this unit&apos;s resources section, but it&apos;s not.
		It also said the resources section includes instructions for installing the module on your system (those instructions are of course also absent), and that both made me weary and gave me slight hope at the same time.
		I don&apos;t install code from random places such as this school on my system.
		I don&apos;t feel safe doing that.
		I don&apos;t want to break my system.
		There also shouldn&apos;t be a need to install a Python module.
		You can just put it in the same directory as your own script and use the same <code>import</code> statement you&apos;d need to use to import the module into your script&apos;s namespace so you can access its functions.
		Installing a random Python module downloaded from some website system-wide is just asinine and asking fro trouble.
		The hopefulness came in though in that perhaps the writer of the assignment was ... how do I put it gently ... ill-versed in the topic?
		There have been repeated instances of assignments at this school in which very bad practices are being taught to students as being the right way to do things.
		It&apos;s as if the assignment authors sometimes aren&apos;t the people that actually know what they&apos;re doing.
		I&apos;m distinctly under the impression that the professors aren&apos;t the ones writing the assignments.
		If the assignment author indeed didn&apos;t know what they were talking about as well as perhaps they should have, they might have thought BeautifulSoup had to be installed even though we&apos;re only using it literally one time for one assignment because information they saw online talked about installing it.
		Perhaps this is the sort of thing that often gets installed and used repeatedly in certain fields.
		If that was the case, BeautifulSoup might very well be in my system&apos;s software repository and I could install it by running a single command on the command line.
		And because it came from the system repository, it&apos;d be a much safer installation than if it came from some random site on the Internet.
		It&apos;s not that I think that software from the school is likely malicious, as long as the source code is available (and as a script and not a compiled binary, the source code would of course be available).
		It&apos;s just that you don&apos;t put files in your system directories (for example, by installing them) except through careful and often system-specific methods.
		Doing so is just bad practice and can lead to problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thankfully, I found the necessary module in the repository after some Web searching.
		Oddly, it looks like the package name has been changed in Debian a couple times.
		At one point, there was a package called <code>beautifulsoup</code>.
		At another, there was <code>python-beautifulsoup</code>.
		Neither package still exists.
		Now, there&apos;s <a href="apt:python-bs4"><code>python-bs4</code></a>.
		That&apos;s a harder to recognise name, but whatever.
		At least the assignment is completable without reinventing the functionality of the module myself.
		I&apos;m ... unsure of the module&apos;s ... correctness.
		I&apos;ve dealt with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>-processing modules in other languages that don&apos;t behave as they should.
		<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is very messy, unlike <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, and often, people building parsing modules don&apos;t code the sort of robustness necessary to deal with that mess.
		I don&apos;t really care right now, because it&apos;s what the assignment said to use and because any lack of robustness and any incorrect behaviour of BeautifulSoup isn&apos;t my fault.
		However, if I wasn&apos;t able to get this installed, it&apos;d spell bad news for me.
		I&apos;d have to reinvent this functionality.
		And worse, I&apos;d have to do it <strong>*right*</strong>.
		There&apos;s just not enough time this week to do that.
		This is the sort of code I care enough about that I couldn&apos;t just throw something together unless the instructions specifically said to do something otherwise unacceptable.
		I&apos;d have to build a robust parser that tokenized the page, used the tokens to understand the structure of the document, located the <code>&lt;a/&gt;</code> elements, extracted their targets regardless of the order in which the attributes were specified in, and removed all tags for parsing.
		I&apos;m just not up for that kind and scale of project right now in addition to the actual assignment I was supposed to be working on.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems that to work with Debian&apos;s BeautifulSoup, I have to use <code>import bs4</code> instead of the <code>import BeautifulSoup</code> that the example code uses.
		I thought this may be a Debian-specific name for the module, which would be unfortunate.
		It&apos;d make my script not cross-platform compatible.
		I figured hopefully this was just a newer name for BeautifulSoup&apos;s module, but as I wrote that, I figured it&apos;d sound lazy of me, as I clearly hadn&apos;t actually looked it up.
		I hadn&apos;t looked it up because it was irrelevant; the school&apos;s BeautifulSoup module was nowhere to be found and this was what I had to work with.
		Regardless of any cross-platform issues, that was the import line I&apos;d need to use.
		But now, to appear less lazy, I&apos;ve looked into the matter.
		It seems that in the official BeautifulSoup documentation, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">the module is indeed called <code>bs4</code> at the time of writing</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried for days to get Python to play nicely with my network proxy.
		It just kept refusing.
		In what I think was my closest set of attempts, I tried telling my script to use SOCKS5 and SOCKS4, both with and without remote resolution.
		None of those options worked though, as Python kept trying to bypass the proxy for name resolution.
		That doesn&apos;t work though.
		My firewall doesn&apos;t allow network traffic to pass through outside the proxy.
		Both SOCKS5 and SOCKS4a are able to resolve host names on their own and don&apos;t need names to be resolved beforehand, so all my applications are able to handle this just fine.
		Python just refuses to play nicely though.
		I even tried working with both <code>urllib</code> and <code>urllib2</code>, as well as (reluctantly) installing a couple new SOCKS-related Python modules.
		On the final day, with only hours left, I finally had to give up.
		I wanted to do this right.
		Really, I did.
		But I ran out of time and had to use an external command outside the Python script to <strong>*force*</strong> python to use the proxy.
		For some software, this works, while other software is still too stubborn and simply fails to operate at all.
		Thankfully, Python accepted the coercion, but I feel defeated.
		If I were working in my native language, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, I&apos;d&apos;ve been able to get the script to do its job instead of using outside force.
		In fact, I <strong>*did*</strong> get one of my previous spiders, one that was written in <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, to do just that with no trouble whatsoever.
		Python just does what it can to make itself a thorn in my side just enough to make coding anything complex highly difficult, but not enough that most people will take me seriously about Python being a screwy language.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wouldn&apos;t normally complain about this, but while I&apos;m being a baby and grumbling about Python anyway, I might as well bring up how often it messes me up that you can&apos;t iterate over a Python list&apos;s indices.
		You literally have to read the length of the list, use it to create a new list of consecutive integers where the index is equal to the value, then iterate over this new list&apos;s values.
		It&apos;s short to write (<code>for i in range(len(list_var)):</code>, but those steps that shouldn&apos;t be necessary are exactly what that line means.
		It&apos;s such an idiotic requirement that I can never remember to do it, and my code ends up buggy and I end up confused for a bit until I figure out the problem.
		I&apos;m told Python was specifically constructed to be an easy language to work with, which means these sorts of bizarre quirks shouldn&apos;t be present in such commonly-used functionalities as simply iterating over a list in which you need access to the indices.
		Most languages I know give you both the key and the value as you iterate, though it&apos;d also be fine to just give you the key and expect you to use the key to look up the value.
		Just the value with no way to iterate over the keys is ... sort of dumb.
		Also of note, Python does return the keys, not the values, when working with dictionaries, which makes this list behaviour not only asinine, but also not internally consistent with how Python handles other types.
		So much for the &quot;duck typing&quot; paradigm Python pretends to promote.
		When working with collections in Python, you do have to know exactly what type of collection you&apos;re dealing with, or you don&apos;t know whether you&apos;ve been handed keys and can thus look up values or whether you&apos;ve instead been handed values and have no access to keys.
		&quot;If it quacks&quot; clearly isn&apos;t enough, when it comes to Python.

	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<h3>On the Unit 5 assignment</h3>
	<p>
		One student marked me down without specifying why.
		Another marked me down for including too many comments.
	</p>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_4.0/y.st./coursework/CS3308/marked_down_again.png" alt="&quot;the code was more of comment&quot; (sic)" class="framed-centred-image" width="806" height="325"/>
	<p>
		Um.
		What?
		Why would comments be a bad thing?
		Also, the phrasing makes it sound like the code doesn&apos;t do anything, it&apos;s all just comments.
		While the comments describe what the code is going for, the code does run and does do what the comments say it does.
	</p>
	<p>
		No further feedback was present.
	</p>
	<h3>On the Unit 6 learning journal</h3>
	<p>
		You asked me to email an example of what I meant about getting marked down because a student didn&apos;t like that I&apos;d posted the code in the submission form instead of attaching it as a separate upload that graders would have had to download.
		I&apos;ve done so, and for archival purposed, I&apos;m including it here too:
	</p>
	<img src="/img/CC_BY-SA_4.0/y.st./coursework/CS3308/marked_down.png" alt="&quot;User pasted but regret that they were not able to attach, please keep it up, you will do better as you practice.&quot;" class="framed-centred-image" width="804" height="324"/>
	<p>
		If you mean a smartphone-type device, &quot;smartphone&quot; is a misnomer, and those things are just pocket computers capable of telephony.
		(To make my point, I actually set my laptop up to place and take calls at one point too, so laptops are as much phones as so-called &quot;smartphones&quot;.
		In any case, my mobile broke down probably over two years ago by now, and I simply haven&apos;t been able to justify paying the high cost of getting a new one.
		The only ones that I are open enough for me to trust them (or at least, to wipe and install a trustworthy operating system, at which point I trust them) are pretty old by now.
		My last one deteriorated quickly because of just that.
		I&apos;d had a brand new one before that one, but the new one got stolen, and when it came time to replace it, those devices were no longer being manufactured.
		I had a nice calendar on both of those devices, and my alarms were synced between my three computers at the time (my home server, my laptop, and my mobile), but I getting another that could very well stop working on me a few months after I buy it doesn&apos;t seem like a good use of money.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oh, wow.
		I&apos;d hate to be stuck unable to clear my Web browser for fear of losing access to accounts I didn&apos;t have the password to.
		I actually have my Web browser set to clear the cache, history, and cookies every time it closes, and not being able to set it that way would be a pain.
	</p>
	<p>
		I understand not wanting to get worked up about one art piece getting censored in the Facebook group.
		The thing you have to understand though is that the school is censoring my own website, not theirs.
		This website is my home.
		It&apos;s where I express myself within my own walls.
		It may not be my physical home, but we don&apos;t live purely physical lives any more.
		People may come to visit, but they&apos;re coming to my place, I&apos;m not going to theirs, and the university decided to barge in, threaten to expel me and/or retroactively fail me from my courses, and demanded that I take down what I had there.
		Again, <em>in my own home</em>.
		It&apos;s not that I can&apos;t speak freely in school, on the school&apos;s website.
		I&apos;m not even free of this garbage <em>in my own home</em>.
		And they didn&apos;t even try asking nicely first.
		They just jumped to the threats.
		Also of note, as of the time of writing this, there are 1019 redacted pages.
		This isn&apos;t just one item.
		I mean, I agree that there was no reason to time you out over your art piece and have it removed.
		But a huge chunk of my own website is stuck behind take-down notices.
		And given that much of the site is dedicated to my daily journal and school is a daily occurrence for me, that number usually grows by at least seven pages per week.
		This isn&apos;t some small thing I can brush off.
		It hurts.
		It causes me <em>physical pain</em>.
		I still get headaches from this, though not like the killer migraine I had for a few days when the censorship started.
		It still drains away my vitality, though.
		It leaves me as a lethargic lump, barely able to function as a human being.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only thing I used to torrent is Debian <abbr title="International Organisation for Standardisation">ISO</abbr>s.
		Those are completely legal.
		I don&apos;t really torrent even those though any more for technical reasons related to my network connection.
		It&apos;s a shame, really, but I guess it doesn&apos;t impact much.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like you said though, not getting along with the school doesn&apos;t mean the future won&apos;t be good.
		And indeed, I do have hope.
		I&apos;ll be in a very good place, once I manage to get into vocal therapy (I&apos;ve been on the waiting list for over a year and was theoretically about to get in until this pandemic shut everything down) and get out of the school.
		I&apos;m not overly worried.
		The future will be fine.
		In the mean time though, knowing that keeps me from doing anything overly stupid, but it doesn&apos;t make the present not highly difficult.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		Lethargic and exasperated.
		I think those two words sum up exactly how I feel and what my attitude is.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I learned how to build a spider that uses document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s.
		I guess maybe I also learned how to have a spider deal with terms at all, but that wasn&apos;t a far leap from what we&apos;d already covered paired with what I knew from the spiders I&apos;d built in the past.
		Working with document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s in a single pass is a bit of a pain though, if you want the terms/document names sorted so the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s will be sequential.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		We kind of put together concepts I knew before this course and concepts I&apos;d learned in this course this week, so there wasn&apos;t anything surprising or wondrously new.
		It was an important unit, and I do feel I&apos;ve gained more from it than other units (though I couldn&apos;t have gained what I did without first understanding the material form past units, so I wouldn&apos;t say this unit was more important by any means), but the material was pretty much almost an inevitability.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation is my main challenge so far.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also of note though, network issues were a huge problem, took most of my time, and in the end, coulnd&apos;t even be solved in time.
		I got the work done, but I had to cheat and not do it the right way.
		To be fair, doing it the right way would involve extra work that other students didn&apos;t even have to bother with, so my cheating only got me out of solving a problem the school didn&apos;t intend to be a part of the assignment.
		Still, I&apos;m a person of principle.
		I didn&apos;t solve the problem, and instead bypassed the problem, so in my eyes, it&apos;s cheating.
		I&apos;m not as bothered by it now as I was while it was going on, but it&apos;s still irritating that I can&apos;t get Python to respect the network proxy.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I can now build a reasonable search engine spider, complete with an index.
		Were I to do it outside this course, I&apos;d almost certainly not bother with document <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s and term <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>s.
		I&apos;d also definitely write it in a language that allowed me to have my script actually use the network proxy properly.
		That aside, this was the most effective spider I&apos;ve built yet.
		The first spider I built was for a different course.
		It only crawled, and didn&apos;t do anything with what it saw besides find new places to crawl to.
		The second, I built on my own time, and it didn&apos;t build an index.
		It only made a list of websites.
		This one actually creates a searchable database though.
		The script is rather short and the spider it encodes is rather simple, but even so, it&apos;s the most-advanced spider I&apos;ve actually built to date.
		That seems like a step up.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		Nothing new, but I don&apos;t do well when I&apos;m under censorship in my own home.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		I&apos;d like to re-attempt my spider project.
		Not now, but some time when I have the energy to even get out of bed.
		I&apos;ll need more resources though.
		At the moment, I don&apos;t even have a home Internet connection, and in addition to an Internet connection, I&apos;ll need a headless desktop with a decent amount of hard drive space.
		All I&apos;ve got for the moment is my laptop, and I can&apos;t run a long-running spider on it, even if it had the drive space.
		It overheats too quickly, not to mention that it disconnects to the network so I can bring it with me, so it wouldn&apos;t be accessible to others most of the time.
	</p>

<section id="Unit8">
	<h2>Unit 8</h2>
	<h3>Describe what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		I read <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/20crawl.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 20crawl.pdf</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/21link.pdf">Introduction to Information Retrieval - 21link.pdf</a>, participated in the discussion assignment, graded work from last week, and took the final exam.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your reactions to what you did.</h3>
	<p>
		When grading, I found that one student got stuck because they&apos;d perfectly imitated how the example code had made use of BeautifulSoup.
		They were getting a type error, which halted the script.
		The example code used BeautifulSoup incorrectly though, and the example wouldn&apos;t run as-is.
		So the student had imitated the example code&apos;s fatal error as well.
		I ran into the same problem, though I was able to solve it with some research.
		Hopefully, my description of how to resolve the issue - which I left as feedback - is enough.
		That assumes they ever get around to reading it before they lose access to it, but at least I tried.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another student uploaded part of their work in the form of a RAR file.
		A RAR file?
		Seriously?
		Thankfully for them, they included the script&apos;s output in the main submission form and they&apos;d uploaded their script itself as a file separate form the contents of the RAR file.
		My feedback to them was a warning that they got away with it this time because the archive contained nothing I needed to grade (I&apos;m guessing it contained the generated index files, but can&apos;t be sure), but next time, they should use a more open archive format that everyone can open.
		I cannot open RAR files - the technology for me to do so simply does not exist for my system.
		I recommended ZIP files, which I think just about everyone can open.
		It&apos;s probably not the best format ever, but at least it&apos;s accessible to most graders.
		Both Linux and Windows have the software for reading those files preinstalled, and I think OS X does too, though I can&apos;t be sure.
	</p>
	<p>
		The final exam was pretty easy.
		I constantly see examples of the school&apos;s lack of understanding of a subject in the quizzes and exams the school employs though.
		For example, take a look at the following question that is present in this course&apos;s final exam:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			In order to access a particular website on the internet, the URL must be converted into an IP address.
			Which service does this conversion?
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I&apos;m going to ignore the fact that &quot;<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>&quot; is a deprecated term and that the modern term is &quot;<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>&quot;.
		While <abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr>s from the <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> have clearly deprecated both the terms &quot;<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>&quot; and &quot;<abbr title="Uniform Resource Name">URN</abbr>&quot; in favour of the unified term &quot;<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>&quot;, the vast majority of people seem to be behind the times and get this wrong, so it&apos;d make sense that the school would get it wrong too.
		It&apos;s just sad because it means the school is perpetuating this state of being behind the times by teaching the next generation to use the outdated term.
		Sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent here.
		Anyway, what the school <strong>*really*</strong> gets outright wrong here is that <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> <strong>*does not operate on <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s at all*</strong>.
		<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s are <strong>*not*</strong> converted into <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses.
		<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> host names - more commonly known as domain names - are translated into <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses.
		A <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> is made up of several parts in the form
	</p>
	<p>
		{scheme}:[{host name}[:{port}]]{path}[?{query}][#{fragment}]
	</p>
	<p>
		where curly braces denote a component name which is replaced by actual text from the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> and square brackets indicate components that might not be present in a given <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.
		(As a side note, the path component cannot be omitted from any <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, though in many cases, it can be set to an empty string.
		It&apos;s a small technicality, but it&apos;s why the path isn&apos;t put in square brackets.
		That&apos;s not a mistake on my part.
		Also of note, if a host component is present, the path <strong>*must*</strong> either be an empty string or begin with a slash, and that slash is a part of the path.)
		Of the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, only the host name gets translated into an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
		The rest of the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> has absolutely no relevance in <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>, and if you were to run a <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> query on the entire <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, you won&apos;t be able to get any sort of <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address out of it and in most cases, you wouldn&apos;t even be able to track down the <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>&apos;s name server.
		Take, for example, the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> <code>https://example.com/</code>.
		The first step in <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> resolution would be to find the <code>com/</code> <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> server.
		No <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr> ends in a slash, so the root name server (there are multiple root name servers, but you only ask one of them in a given <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> request, if you even ask one at all instead of relying on the cache, but you&apos;d definitely need to ask the root server if you were using an invalid <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>, as it wouldn&apos;t be in the cache) would reply that no such name server exists.
		You could also extend that to other cases.
		Say, for example, you want to download the file located using the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> <code>https://example.com/directory/file.zip</code>.
		In this case, if you feed the whole <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> into the <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> resolution process, <code>zip</code> is now the <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>.
		<a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt"><code>zip</code> is on the list of in-use <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>s provided by <abbr title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</abbr></a>, meaning that you would manage to get the address of a name server for the <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>.
		It&apos;d just be the <strong>*wrong*</strong> <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>.
		You and I both know we want the <code>com</code> <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>&apos;s name server, not the <code>zip</code> <abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>&apos;s server.
		From there, we&apos;d then try to look up the second-level domain, which having fed the full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> into the name-resolution protocol, would be <code>com/directory/file</code>.
		That&apos;s obviously invalid, so we&apos;d then get a response from the <code>zip</code> name server stating as much.
		I could go on and on, but the point is that when you feed full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s into <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> resolution, you don&apos;t get the results you&apos;re after.
		You don&apos;t convert <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s into <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses using <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>.
		That&apos;s not how <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> works, and the question posed by the school shows that whoever wrote the final exam didn&apos;t understand that.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe any feedback you received or any specific interactions you had.</h3>
	<p>
		No worries on the delayed feedback.
		It works out anyway, as I have a long-time habit of including the final exam as part of my discussion in my final learning journal entry, when relevant.
		(That is, when the learning journal questions are open-ended enough to allow it.)
		I got most of my learning journal entry done the day before yesterday, but I did have to wait until today to submit anyway to make sure I could include the final exam, so after the exam, I just finished up my writing, then checked to see if your feedback had arrived, after which I could really finalise the entry.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yeah, I do tend to write entries that are a bit long.
		When I take the time to write about something at all, I tend to go into details more than others do.
	</p>
	<p>
		Exactly like you said, you can put all files in one directory and import them.
		There&apos;s no need for a system-wide install.
		Except that the BeautifulSoup module, which the school claimed was made available in the unit&apos;s resources section, which it wasn&apos;t.
		As far as I could find, there was no file to put in the same directory as our own code file.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wouldn&apos;t be opposed to learning Node.js, though I&apos;m not familiar with it at the moment.
		I&apos;ve been known to struggle with JavaScript in the past, though to be fair, I use it so rarely that it&apos;s no wonder I struggle; I simply haven&apos;t had the practice I need with it yet!
		Most JavaScript on Web pages these days is either pointless and unnecessary or (such as is the case on this university&apos;s own website) is an outright hindrance to the site&apos;s accessibility.
		In most cases, JavaScript on Web pages can and often should be left out.
		One thing about me is that I don&apos;t do &quot;hello world&quot; scripts and the like.
		If there&apos;s not a purpose in building something, I don&apos;t build it.
		I need an actual project, not a toy script, if I&apos;m to be able to retain interest enough to learn something.
		Hence the lack of practice.
		Node.js changes things up a bit though.
		It uses JavaScript, but not for troublesome client-side scripting garbage.
		Working on Node.js projects would give me a situation in which I could actually make use of - and thus learn to use - JavaScript.
		It&apos;s definitely something I should look into.
		Also on my list of languages I want to learn is Perl.
	</p>
	<p>
		Who issued a take-down notice against my website?
		Who is it that&apos;s censoring me, you ask?
		The school!
		This school.
		University of the People is censoring me, as I&apos;ve been saying all along.
		This is why I feel most lethargic when I&apos;m working on anything school-related.
		I used to <strong>*love*</strong> working on my coursework here.
		I loved to learn, and I loved to put everything I had into my submissions.
		Through the threatening take-down letter though, the school has drained all that from me.
		I can&apos;t stand being here now, and getting my coursework done is now such a chore.
		I often spend hours at a time just staring at my monitor, trying to force myself to actually start the work.
		You know the nights I mentioned in past units in which I had to stay up all night, literally not getting any sleep?
		And I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve mentioned it, but there are even more nights in which I do get a few hours of sleep, but not enough.
		This is all because I can&apos;t even work up the motivation to get started, then have to pull more time out of nowhere by working on coursework instead of getting the rest I need.
		I don&apos;t do well under censorship.
		I&apos;m not even functional as a human being when under censorship.
		And the school is the one doing this to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for the <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> idea, it doesn&apos;t really work against threatening take-down letters.
		The school knows who I am and can - as they threatened to do - expel me and/or retroactively fail me from my past courses.
		And my website is public, so they can see if I&apos;m not in compliance with their threats.
		The worst part is that the school jumped right to threatening me.
		They didn&apos;t even try asking nicely first, then when I declined, they started threatening me.
		If they had asked nicely, I would have taken down what they found objectionable, and no one would have gotten hurt.
		But they don&apos;t care about student well-being, so they just forced their way from the beginning regardless of what damage they might cause and what they might break.
		And what they broke was me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also on the note of <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr>s, I use <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>, myself.
		It&apos;s not exactly a <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr>, but I feel it gives me more privacy than a <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> could.
		With a <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr>, the <abbr title="virtual private network">VPN</abbr> provider can track you.
		With <abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr>, no one party knows both where you are and who you&apos;re speaking with.
		My firewall is set up to block all non-<abbr title="The Onion Router">Tor</abbr> traffic aside from traffic only passing through the intranet and not the Internet, so I can avoid all leaks from misbehaving software such as Python.
		As for crazies in the family, I know how that feels.
		My mother has always been bipolar, condescending, over-controlling, and toxic.
		She disowned two of her children because, after the divorce, they wanted to continue a relationship with both parents.
		If they wouldn&apos;t exclusively side with her, she wanted nothing to do with them.
		As for me, she&apos;s been avoiding me for over two years now because she can&apos;t accept that I&apos;m an enby.
		She&apos;d rather not have a queer in the family, I guess.
		I don&apos;t know if she technically is disowning me, as she won&apos;t say it to my face (or say <strong>*anything*</strong> to my face, really), but I might as well be.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you said you can&apos;t just let spiders go wandering, I got the mental image of a tarantula on a leash.
		Don&apos;t let it go too far!
	</p>
	<p>
		How do I complete the assignments without a home Internet connection?
		Very painfully.
		Sometimes I take my laptop over to the local library, where they offer an Internet connection.
		Other times, I use my neighbour&apos;s Wi-Fi, as they gave me the password to it.
		Their connection has the advantage of allowing me to work from home, but it&apos;s an unreliable connection and frequently drops or runs slowly.
		It is what it is though.
		I tried to set up a home Internet connection, but the local <abbr title="Internet service provider">ISP</abbr> was deliberately making things difficult and pissing me off.
		I got fed up and gave up.
		I&apos;ll no doubt go crawling back to them at some point, but for now, I don&apos;t have the time or the energy to deal with their garbage, considering my lethargy from the school&apos;s censorship of me and all.
		Once school is over and I have more of my energy and patience back, I can probably get something worked out.
		In the mean time, that&apos;s money they&apos;re not making all because they want to make themselves a thorn in my side.
		It&apos;s not just me, either.
		They have one of the lowest customer satisfaction ratings of any company in my country.
		The fact is though that they have a monopoly in the areas they service, so you either choose to give them your money or you choose not to have service.
		Gotta&apos; love monopolies, no?
	</p>
	<h3>Describe your feelings and attitudes.</h3>
	<p>
		My mental state has been progressively deteriorating for quite a while now.
		Memory loss and inability to concentrate have been getting worse, but I&apos;ve mostly been able to manage.
		Until now.
		It&apos;s gotten to the point that I&apos;m not even remembering important appointments until the day after I was supposed to go to them.
		And yet, I&apos;m trapped.
		There&apos;s nothing I can do about the decline, as far as I can tell.
		I do what I can to relax in an attempt to lessen the damage, but it&apos;s no longer enough.
		The stress is just more than I can handle.
		This stupid pandemic isn&apos;t helping, either.
		It&apos;s put my life on hold to the point where I can&apos;t even make progress in anything worthwhile.
		I was already at a bottleneck, with everything having to wait on my vocal therapy, and now I can&apos;t get into that because the only local clinic I could find offering such services has closed down for the foreseeable future.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a few months, I&apos;ve been thinking that if I could get ahead in my studies, I could use my free time to try yet again to find an online therapist.
		Getting ahead has proven impossible in my current mental state though.
		The term has now ended, and I can work on recovery a bit, but the last two breaks between terms have proven not to have been restful or allowed me to recover, despite being my least-active breaks yet due to the pandemic.
		These breaks have actually left me even more tired, unlike previous breaks, which allowed me to recover at least part of my energy and motivation.
		Chances are, this break isn&apos;t going to be restful either.
	</p>
	<p>
		I feel like I&apos;m losing my sanity, and I&apos;ve already lost much of my mental clarity.
		I guess this doesn&apos;t have to do with the material at all.
		But the learning journal asks a question completely unrelated to the material, such as &quot;what are your feelings and attitudes&quot;, the answer is going to be completely unrelated to the material in most cases.
	</p>
	<h3>Describe what you learned.</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t feel like I learned much this week.
		Partly, it was due to the material covering things I&apos;ve already dealt with, but part of it was that I was in no state to take in much information.
	</p>
	<p>
		I guess I learned about spider traps though, and the need to be prepared for them.
	</p>
	<h3>What surprised me or caused me to wonder?</h3>
	<p>
		The fact that spider traps are actually a thing surprised me.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I was much younger and had no idea what I was doing, I set up a Web forum using a now-defunct forum-hosting company called InvisionPlus.
		They&apos;d sort of locked themselves into using a particular out-dated version of a forum-running software called Invision Power Board, and they couldn&apos;t updated it because of the noxious terms of the license agreement.
		New features pretty much never came due to the lack of updates, though they did add some mods and bug patches from third parties sometimes.
		As such, the sort of slowly descended into obscurity as their bills overtook them and they had to close up shop.
		They could have survived, I think, had they used freely-licensed software instead, such as competing software phpBB.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway, I&apos;d seen other hosted forum there suffer from spam bot problems sometimes, so when I set up my own forum, I built what I called a robot trap.
		It was a loop of subforums with no actual posting options, if I recall, where I intended robots searching for places to post to get trapped and not actually get to post anywhere.
		I pictured robots as entities that moved from page to page, existing on one page at a time and unable to leave if there were no outbound links.
		So as these subforums were looped - think of something along the lines of a symbolic link directory loop on a file system - the spiders should be trapped forever.
		Later in life, I considered this view of robots to be completely and utterly ridiculous.
		I doubt very much that my &quot;robot trap&quot; did anything productive whatsoever.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still, it was interesting to hear that other means could have been used to trap robots, to an extent, though probably not using the software I had access to at the time.
		For example, if dynamically-generated <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s were used, it could appear like there were an infinite number of pages to crawl looking for places to post, without discreet page data actually existing on the server.
		Any intelligently-programmed robot shouldn&apos;t fall for even these better traps though.
	</p>
	<h3>What happened that felt particularly challenging? Why was it challenging to me?</h3>
	<p>
		As discussed in <a href="#Unit1">my Unit 1 learning journal entry</a>, motivation has been my biggest obstacle.
		My continued metal decline made this week especially challenging though, which is really sad, considering that there was almost no work to be done this week.
		This should have been one of the easiest weeks for me.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills and knowledge do I recognise that I am gaining?</h3>
	<p>
		I didn&apos;t really gain any skills this week, as I didn&apos;t do anything.
		I learn by doing or writing, not by reading, and this especially applies to me in my reduced mental state.
		Especially in this state, reading alone doesn&apos;t teach me much, and I quickly forget.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for knowledge, I think I&apos;ve learned I need to take more care in building spiders.
		Various pitfalls exist, such as the aforementioned robot traps, but even things such as distribution, scalibility, and extensbility need to be taken into account.
		Even if the spider is only running on a single machine, if you plan to keep it for long, it should probably be designed as a single-instance distributed system.
		That way, it&apos;s not hard to add more instances as needed and actually distribute the load when the time comes.
		As fore extensibility, the old trick of modularity is ever useful.
		We built such simple spiders in this course.
		It&apos;s easy to forget that a robust spider should be more complicated than what we did, sand should actually be built as a series of interchangeable pieces that can be added, removed, and swapped as the spider needs to be changed.
		Modularity is almost always something that should be built into a project from the very beginning.
	</p>
	<h3>What am I realising about myself as a learner?</h3>
	<p>
		First, I don&apos;t do well under censorship.
		That applies to all areas of my life, learning included.
		Second, my mental decline, caused by said censorship, is continuing even after two years.
		I thought I&apos;d had this kind of under control and I could last out my final year.
		And I&apos;m still going to try to do that.
		I don&apos;t have this under control though.
		I&apos;m getting worse.
	</p>
	<h3>In what ways am I able to apply the ideas and concepts gained to my own experience?</h3>
	<p>
		I don&apos;t know.
		I guess the ideas of extensibility and modularity are something that I apply to most of my more-complex projects.
		This isn&apos;t new, it&apos;s just something I need to remember to keep doing.
		I don&apos;t think anything specific to information retrieval this week is likely to apply to my life at the moment though.
